# Norbela: Magic Branches by 1900 — Buckets & Story Hooks

---

## Dominant by 1900 (structural, mainstream, baked into society)

### 1. Ecosystem Magic
- **Status:** Fully mainstream, foundational science.
- Governments, guilds, and navies all think in **biomes + creature portfolios**.
- Ministries of **Arcane Ecology & Extraction Planning** exist.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Resource wars over keystone species in specific arcs.
  - Climate shifts or species collapses nuke a region’s magic style.

### 2. Refinement / Process Magic
- **Status:** Backbone of magitech industry.
- Refineries are half chemical plant, half temple, half computer.
- Process variants = spell variants.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Industrial espionage, magical Chernobyls, guild politics over “standard cuts.”

### 4. Residue Magic (infrastructure)
- **Status:** Dominant but hated; necessary evil.
- Cities run on prime oil (high-end), **Residue grids** (heavy lifting/weird stuff), fauxil/slagcells (bulk).
- Residue towers are critical; failure means disaster for districts.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Sabotage/failure of Residue infrastructure.
  - Politics over which neighborhoods become **Residue sinks**.

### 8. Co-evolution
- **Status:** Baked-in assumption among experts; background law of nature.
- Stock lines and wild lines are rapidly diverging.
- Policy: push a strain too hard, it goes feral or crashes.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Feral variant breaks a refinery chain.
  - Domesticated line reverts/hybridizes in the wild.
  - Old recipes stop working as creatures change.

## Fringe but rising (hot, contested, future-defining)

### 9. Synthetic Magic
- **Status:** Cutting edge, small but explosive.
- Great for narrow applications, poor for broad/ritual magic.
- Backed by ambitious states/corps, feared by traditionalists/ecologists.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Synthetic House vs Old-Blood Baron conflict.
  - Synthetic breakthrough obsoletes a biome’s economy.
  - Hidden side effects: new Residue, unknown failure modes.

### 3. Attunement (regulated)
- **Status:** Niche but indispensable, expanding slowly.
- Highly regulated attuned classes: grid-tuners, deep divers, reactor wardens.
- Attuned bloodlines: half-asset, half-problem.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Attuned union/guild flexes leverage.
  - State pushes unethical attunement program.
  - Attuned as both safety systems and disposable.

## Suppressed / taboo (powerful, story-juicy, institutionally stomped)

### 3. Attunement (unregulated/cultic)
- **Status:** Taboo/illegal in most states.
- DIY graft cults, line-mixing, hereditary programs.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Feral attunement cult as parallel society.
  - Government black lab does illegal attunement.
  - “Pure-blood” vs “line-mixed” politics/pogroms.

### 4. Residue Cults & Blackline Sorcery
- **Status:** Feared, demonized, used off-the-books.
- Unofficial Residue practices: prophecy, memory warping, glitch rites.
- **Story hooks:**
  - City leans on Residue cult to stabilize grid.
  - Blackline faction erases evidence/memories by “smearing” the field.

### 9. Synthetic Extremism
- **Status:** Official R&D okay; some lines hard-banned.
- Taboo: binding Aetherite, synthetic attunement, self-replicating Residue.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Whistleblower plot: lab designs magical grey goo.
  - State jumps ahead via forbidden synthetic tech.

### 1 & 8 Taboos: Eco-crimes
- **Arcane poaching:** Slaughtering banned species, breaking Compacts, wiping out biomes.
- **Weaponized co-evolution:** Labs breed feral strains as bioweapons.
- **Story hooks:**
  - Frontier war with feral strain bioweapon.
  - Ecologist protagonist exposes keystone genocide.

## Three Pressure Points for Stories

1. **Synthetic vs natural**
2. **Residue as utility vs occult**
3. **Attunement as regulated class vs forbidden evolution**

Hang any plot on these fault lines for a story rooted in Norbela’s magitech history.
