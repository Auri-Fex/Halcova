# Norbela: State of Magical Oil & Alternatives by 1880

---

## 1. How “oil” itself has changed

### 1500: it’s just goo
- Thick, viscous liquid from a specific gland.
- Burned, smeared, or dunked; only “jar” vs “lamp” forms considered.

### By 1880: “oil” = a category, not a phase
- “Prime oil” = any primary, high-grade magical medium from creatures, regardless of form.

**a) Liquid fractions**
- Light, medium, heavy cuts, tuned by temperature, pressure, additives.
- Uses: lamps, instruments, medical (light); engines, prosthetics (medium); ship drives, factories (heavy).

**b) Gels & salves**
- Oils thickened with waxes, clays, or biological thickeners.
- Uses: medical (healing, anesthetic, grafts); structural (vibration-damping, impact buffers).

**c) Waxes & films**
- Waxy exudates or processed oils.
- Uses: protective coatings, insulation layers, constraint of magic.

**d) Vapors & aerosols**
- Distilled fractions vaporized for inhaled anesthetics, illusions, communication mists.
- Uses: crowd control, field work, sound/light alteration.

**e) Crystals & stones**
- Oils crystallized by cooling/compression/salting.
- Uses: capacitors, lenses, authentication tokens.

## 2. Other magical tissues beyond oil

**a) Bone & carapace**
- Ground into bonechar, combined with Residue → bonewire conductors/insulators.
- Used for field guidance, memory structures.

**b) Membranes & skin**
- Lumen membranes for windows, gauges, viewing ports.
- Skins as living gaskets, self-healing seals.

**c) Blood, marrow, and humors**
- Fractions for rituals, attunement, battle drugs, engine overclocking.

**d) Nerve clusters & sensory organs**
- Targeting arrays, directional microphones/sonar, nerve-tissue lattices in devices.

**e) Gut flora, symbionts, parasites**
- Cultured for fauxil pre-conditioning, Residue flavoring, synthetic stabilization.

## 3. Alternatives: What do they run on?

### 3.1 Second-tier biologic alts
- **Fauxil:** plants, bonechar, blood sludge, trace prime oil; bulk heat, low-end engines, stoves.
- **Gut-tars & marrow-pitches:** gut residue/marrow boil-off; road binders, waterproofing, flame weapons.
- **Membrane resins:** processed skin/membranes; insulators, filters.

### 3.2 Residue-derived alts
- **Slagcells:** Residue + metals + salts; power packets for devices, lamps, trams.
- **Residue bricks:** compressed Residue-soaked dust/ash/plant; field effects, anti-scrying, jamming, curses.
- **Field taps:** devices that “drink” ambient Residue for localized effects; illusions, lighting, cleaning charms.

### 3.3 Synthetic arcane compounds
- **Syn-oils:** non-creature chem, seeded with catalysts; stable, narrow effects for engines, consumer products.
- **Syn-resins & syn-crystals:** engineered for refinery pipelines, capacitors, sensors.
- **Synthetic attunement reagents:** experimental, often illegal; induce attunement without creatures.

## 4. Are alternatives more prominent than oil by 1880?

- **Mass power:** alternatives dominate (fauxil, slagcells, Residue grids).
- **High-end magic:** prime oil still rules (engines, medicine, strategic devices).
- **Prime oil:** aviation fuel, weapon-grade fissiles, high-end meds.
- **Alternatives:** coal, gas, batteries, solvents.

## 5. Are the alternatives all runoff/byproduct?

- **Runoff-based:** Residue bricks, slagcells, bonewire, gut-tars.
- **Dedicated alt sources:** magic-tolerant crops, bred creatures, syn-oils from mineral/chemical feedstock.
- **Hybrid:** fauxil from waste-burning, now its own agricultural sector.

## 6. TL;DR state of oil by 1880

- “Oil” = technical family: liquids, gels, films, vapors, crystals.
- Creature bodies exploited nose-to-tail: bone, skin, blood, nerves, gut flora.
- Alternatives matter: fauxil/slagcells for the masses, Residue grids/field taps for cities, syn-oils threaten monopolies.
- Prime oil: top-shelf, high-bandwidth, politically explosive, above a messy pyramid of alt fuels and byproduct magics.
