# Hálcova: Political Philosophy in a Fate-Real World

## The Fundamental Problem

Every political philosophy on Earth assumes a baseline: people are created equal, or they aren't, but either way you can't *prove* it by reading their metaphysical signature at birth.

Hálcova doesn't have that luxury.

The [Sórscad](fate_system.md) exists. It's readable. It predicts outcomes with uncomfortable accuracy. This breaks political philosophy at its foundations and forces reconstruction from first principles.

## The Questions That Matter

### What Does "Equality" Mean?

**On Earth**: Equality typically means equal moral worth, equal rights, equal standing before the law—regardless of observable differences in capability or circumstance.

**On Hálcova**: Observable differences include *fate itself*. The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm.

**The Problem**:

If equality means "treat everyone the same regardless of pattern," you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality.

If equality means "treat everyone according to their pattern," you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is.

**Possible Positions**:

*Pattern Realism*: Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment.

*Pattern Skepticism*: Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns—which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth.

*Pattern Complexity*: Equality doesn't mean "same treatment." It means "equal consideration of interests." A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration—it means they need different support.

## Consent

On Hálcova, the Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. Consent is complicated by prediction, manipulation, and pattern constraints. Positions: experienced, structural, predictive, skepticism.

## Legitimacy

Authority may be legitimized by pattern, Loom-sanction, prediction, or pragmatic success. Regional theories: Heartlands (theocratic), Shattered Reaches (contract), Middle Waters (contested), Vent Lands (expertise), Far Shelf (autonomy).

## Legal Frameworks

Intent and prediction: pattern-predictive policing, pattern-blind law, pattern-weighted sentencing, pattern as mitigating factor. Actual legal variation by region. Criminal justice intersects with residue production; execution rates and residue demand are linked.

## Property and Pattern

Inheritance, contracts, innovation, and property rights are shaped by pattern. Positions: libertarian, distributive, communitarian, skeptic.

## Inter-Regional Politics

Trade web: residue, food, labor flows. Power balance: Heartlands (military), Shattered Reaches (navy), Vent Lands (fortress), Middle Waters (contested), Far Shelf (space).

## Warden Order

Transnational authority, legal presence varies by region, resistance and political function.

## Summary Table

| Question | Orthodox (Heartlands) | Contractarian (Reaches) | Colonial (Middle Waters) | Technocratic (Vents) | Autonomist (Far Shelf) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Equality | Pattern determines worth | Formal equality despite pattern | Depends who's asking | Expertise determines worth | Pattern oppresses; resist |
| Justice | Pattern-deviation is crime | Actions matter, not patterns | Power determines | Guild judgment | Community decides |
| Consent | Pattern includes consent | Real but fragile | Manufactured | Irrelevant to competence | Essential to legitimacy |
| Authority | Divine pattern-mandate | Agreement of governed | Whoever wins | Those who can | Those who defend |
