# Hálcova: Planetary Parameters

## The Star: Sárgvas (The Amber Eye)

**Classification**: K-type orange dwarf
**Color**: Orange-amber
**Temperature**: ~4,800K (cooler than Earth's sun)
**Age**: ~7 billion years (stable, long-lived)

### Visual Effects

**Daylight**:
- Amber-gold tinted light
- Shadows cast with faint blue-purple complementary
- "White" objects appear cream or gold
- Longer, more colorful sunrises and sunsets

**Sky Color**:
- Daytime sky: teal-tinged blue (orange light scattering differently)
- Overcast: bronze or copper cast
- Dawn/dusk: deep amber to blood red, lingering

**Biological Implications**:
- Less ultraviolet radiation (slower vitamin D synthesis, less skin damage)
- More infrared (everything feels warmer than light levels suggest)
- Different photosynthesis chemistry—vegetation likely dark-colored (black, purple, deep red) to absorb available wavelengths more efficiently

## Orbital Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Earth Comparison |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Orbital Period | 526 Earth days (~1.44 Earth years) | 365 days |
| Local Days per Year | 350.667 | 365 |
| Day Length | 36 hours | 24 hours |
| Axial Tilt | ~20° | 23.5° |
| Orbital Eccentricity | ~0.15 | 0.017 |

### Orbital Characteristics

**Eccentricity Effects**:
- Significant difference between perihelion (closest to sun) and aphelion (furthest)
- Perihelion: ~15% more solar energy than aphelion
- This amplifies seasonal variation—perihelion summer is significantly warmer than aphelion summer would be

**Tilt Effects**:
- Moderate seasons from axial tilt (slightly less extreme than Earth)
- Combined with eccentricity creates complex seasonal patterns
- Hemispheric seasons differ in intensity based on whether tilt-summer aligns with perihelion or aphelion

---

## Rotation and Atmospheric Effects

### Slower Rotation Consequences

**Day/Night Cycle**:
- 36-hour days create longer exposure periods
- Greater diurnal temperature swings (more time to heat during day, cool at night)
- Biphasic sleep patterns likely (two sleep periods per day)

**Coriolis Effect**:
- Significantly weaker than Earth
- Weather patterns move more directly north-south
- Fewer large rotating storm systems
- Less efficient heat transfer from equator to poles
- Result: more extreme temperature gradients between latitudes

**Atmospheric Circulation**:
- Hadley cells extend further poleward
- Fewer distinct wind belts
- Weather more predictable day-to-day but more extreme when it changes
- Thermal winds between day and night sides can be significant

## The Five Moons

Hálcova has five moons, creating complex tidal patterns and serving as religious/cultural symbols tied to the five circles of the Sórscad.

| Moon | Name | Size | Orbital Period | Appearance | Association |
|------|------|------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Lélek** (LAY-lek) | Largest (~1/4 Luna) | ~30 local days | Bright, obvious phases, pale gold | Léilcrù (Soul), Core Binding |
| 2 | **Hús** (HOOSH) | Medium | ~18 local days | Reddish tint, fast-moving | Húslaimh (Flesh), Flesh Shaping |
| 3 | **Kötel** (KUH-tel) | Medium | ~45 local days | Dim, difficult to see, grey | Cóitcai (Binding), Pact Summoning |
| 4 | **Vég** (VAYG) | Small | ~12 local days | Fast, bright white point | Hálmaht (Death), Colony Summoning |
| 5 | **Fonál** (FOH-nahl) | Smallest | ~60 local days | Distant, barely visible | Sórscad (Fate), Fate Threading |

### Tidal Effects

**Complex Patterns**:
- Five moons create overlapping tidal cycles
- "Great Tides" occur when multiple moons align (predictable but rare)
- Extreme tidal ranges during alignment affect:
  - Coastal construction and habitation
  - Sea ice formation and breakup
  - Marine creature behavior
  - Navigation and port schedules

**Cultural Significance**:
- Each moon associated with a Sórscad circle and magical practice
- Lunar conjunctions considered ominous or auspicious depending on combination
- Timekeeping uses lunar cycles alongside solar year
- Religious festivals tied to specific moon phases and alignments

## Auroral Phenomena

### Why Auroras Are Extreme

**Contributing Factors**:
- Weaker magnetic field (slower rotation = weaker dynamo)
- Five moons (potential magnetic field interactions)
- K-star solar wind (different particle composition)
- Pattern Residue atmospheric concentration

**Characteristics**:
- More frequent (weaker magnetic shielding)
- Visible at lower latitudes (larger auroral oval)
- Different color palette (more reds, purples from K-star spectrum)
- Correlated with moon positions
- **Correlated with Pattern Residue concentration**

### The Aurora-Magic Connection

**Observed Correlations**:
- High aurora activity = high Residue concentration
- The Loom is more accurate during aurora events
- Certain magical operations more effective
- Wardens more sensitive to deviation detection
- Echoes more active and coherent

**Possible Explanations**:
- Residue particles interact with solar wind
- The magnetic field channels both phenomena
- Auroras are visible manifestation of Residue energy state
- Unknown causal relationship

---

## Climate System

### Why Hálcova Is Cold

**Multiple Contributing Factors**:

1. **Distance from Sárgvas**: Orbits at distance producing ice-world baseline
2. **Dimmer star**: K-type provides less energy than G-type at same distance
3. **Atmospheric composition**: Less greenhouse effect than Earth
4. **Pattern Residue**: Ambient Residue absorbs thermal energy (see below)

### Temperature Ranges

| Zone | Láng (Summer) | Csend (Winter) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Middle Waters (warmest) | +10°C to +20°C | +5°C to +10°C |
| Temperate coasts | +5°C to +15°C | -15°C to -5°C |
| Continental interior | 0°C to +10°C | -30°C to -15°C |
| Transition zones | -5°C to +5°C | -40°C to -25°C |
| Polar edges | -15°C to -5°C | -60°C to -40°C |
| Deep polar | -30°C to -20°C | Below -70°C |

### Pattern Residue and Temperature

**The Mechanism**:

Pattern Residue in its "charged" state absorbs thermal energy from the environment. It is thermodynamically active—pulling heat into itself.

**The Feedback Loop**:
1. Death releases Pattern Residue
2. Residue absorbs heat from environment
3. Environment cools
4. Cold contributes to more death
5. Cycle continues

**The Mitigation**:
- Harvested Residue can be "burned" to release stored heat
- Burning permanently discharges the Residue (becomes inert "ash")
- Cities burn Residue for warmth—creating heated islands
- This draws ambient Residue toward population centers (where it's consumed)
- Surrounding areas become relatively colder

**Implications**:
- Civilization requires Residue burning to survive
- Death fuels survival—the fundamental dark irony
- Climate can be engineered through Residue management
- Battlefields and plague sites are freezing until harvested
- Polar regions are extreme because ancient death was never harvested

## Köd: The Fifth Season in Detail

### The Polar Bleed

During Köd, the boundary between Hálcova and Elsewhere thins. The effect is strongest at the poles and diminishes toward the equator.

### Full Bleed (Polar Regions)

**Physical Environment**:
- Visual distortions (wrong distances, shifted colors)
- Sound anomalies (echoes from nothing, unnatural silence)
- Temperature fluctuations unconnected to weather
- Ground-level aurora-like phenomena

**Entity Activity**:
- Elsewhere beings manifest without summoning
- Appear partial, flickering, attention wandering
- Most ignore humans; some don't
- All five factions appear:
  - **Accountants**: Counting, ignoring unless debts exist
  - **Hungry**: Seeking sensation—the dangerous ones
  - **Architects**: Adjusting, positioning, arranging
  - **Mirrors**: Watching, following, studying observers
  - **Absent**: Simply present, doing nothing visible

**Human Effects**:
- Pact Summoners feel entities without calling
- Core Binders' echoes become hyperactive, may realize they're dead
- Fate Threaders pull "sideways" futures
- Colony hosts feel colonies reaching toward something
- Unpacted humans: hallucinations, intrusions, compulsions

### Partial Bleed (Transition Zones)

- Entities sensed but not fully manifest
- Voices, glimpses, influences
- Stronger effects near polar edge
- Habitable but disturbing
- Some permanent settlements with adaptation strategies

### Minor Phenomena (Temperate Band)

- Vivid dreams, especially of unlived lives
- Déjà vu and premonition spikes
- Paranoia and suspicion increase
- Minor visual/auditory phenomena
- Loom predictions become strange (accurate about improbable things)

### Protected Zone (Middle Waters)

- Minimal Köd effects
- Theories: warmth, volcanic activity, population density, unknown factor
- Refugees flee toward Middle Waters during Köd
- Prices and tensions spike

### Who Enters the Polar Bleed?

**The Desperate**: Seeking pacts without leverage, escaping patterns, pursuing forbidden knowledge

**The Fortified**: Research expeditions, military operations, resource extraction (heavy protection)

**The Trapped**: Outposts that can't evacuate, indigenous survivors, things that were human

### Religious Responses

**Orthodox**: Polar bleed proves the danger of straying from The Weaver's design. Wardens close transition borders. Returnees examined for contamination.

**Threadist**: The bleed shows fate is unfinished. Insights from Köd may reveal the collaborative nature of design.

**Hollow Saint**: The bleed is the crack in fate's prison. Pilgrimage to the edge (not into full bleed) is holy work.

**Colony Cult**: Colonies remember something from the bleed. The original unity existed there.

**Ancestor Speaker**: Echoes become dangerous during Köd. This is when the dead most need binding—for their protection.

**Fleshwright**: Elsewhere entities are just different biology. Study them (safely) to understand life without pattern.

## Pattern Residue Thermodynamics

### The Mechanism

Pattern Residue is "condensed probability"—fate-weight made physical. This exotic matter has unusual thermodynamic properties.

**Charged State**:
- Residue in natural/raw form actively absorbs thermal energy
- Pulls heat from environment into itself
- Stores energy as captured entropy/information

**Triggered Release**:
- Specific conditions (chemical, magical, mechanical) release stored energy
- Energy emerges as heat
- Residue becomes "spent" or "ash"—thermodynamically inert

**Equilibrium**:
- Natural Residue absorbs until saturated
- Slowly re-radiates over time
- Absorption is fast; re-radiation is slow
- Net effect: heat trapped, world cooled

### The Climate Feedback Loop

1. Death releases Pattern Residue
2. Residue absorbs heat from environment
3. Environment cools
4. Cold contributes to death
5. More Residue released
6. Loop continues

### The Civilization Counter-Loop

1. Residue is harvested
2. Harvested Residue burned for heat
3. Local heat released (cities warm)
4. Spent Residue doesn't return to atmosphere
5. Less atmospheric Residue = slightly warmer baseline
6. But harvesting draws more Residue toward cities
7. Surrounding areas relatively colder
8. Cities become warm islands

### Implications

**The Dark Bargain**: Civilization survives by burning death. The more death harvested, the warmer cities can be. Peace reduces fuel supply.

**Climate Control**: Institutions could warm or cool regions by managing Residue distribution. This is probably happening.

**The Polar Question**: Why so cold? Ancient mass death? Residue migration? Deliberate engineering? Elsewhere connection?

**The Middle Waters Question**: Why warm? Volcanic heat? Less historical death? Living density? Unknown protection?
