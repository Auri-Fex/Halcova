# The Five Arts of Hálcova

## A Comprehensive Guide to the Magic Systems

---

## Overview

In Hálcova, power is never free. Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects.

The five magical traditions—collectively called the Five Arts—each represent a different answer to the question: *What are you willing to pay?*

| Art | What You Spend | What You Get | What It Costs You |
|-----|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Core Binding** | The dead | Echoes of the deceased | Your sense of self (bleed corruption) |
| **Flesh Shaping** | Blood and meat | Constructed servants | Your body and humanity |
| **Pact Summoning** | Your soul | Elsewhere entities | Your autonomy and existence |
| **Fate Threading** | Your future | Versions of yourself | Your potential and becoming |
| **Colony Summoning** | Corpses and biomass | Fungal constructs | Your identity and bodily sovereignty |

Each Art is a transaction. Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late.

## Category One: Core Binding

### The Art of Holding the Dead

#### Fundamental Principle

When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit—something more fundamental. The **core** is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned.

Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as **echoes**—manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life.

The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist.

You know. They don't. That's the relationship.

#### The Core

**What It Is**

The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans—animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo.

**Harvesting**

Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor.

Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete).

The strongest cores come from:
- Violent deaths
- Deaths with unfinished purpose
- Deaths accompanied by intense emotion
- Deaths that the dying refused to accept

The weakest cores come from:
- Peaceful passings
- Deaths accepted and prepared for
- Lives that felt complete

### Core Binding
**Mechanics**: Harvest the core of the dead, bind it to an anchor, summon echoes. Upkeep requires Pattern Residue. Echoes decay over time, and binders risk identity bleed.
**Example**: A binder keeps the echo of a lost mentor for advice, but the echo begins to confuse memories and personalities.

### Flesh Shaping
**Mechanics**: Sacrifice blood and flesh to animate homunculi. Materials and complexity determine the servant's abilities. Tethering links the homunculus to the creator, but too many weaken the binder.
**Example**: A fleshwright creates a guardian from bone and clay, but the tether strains their health and sanity.

### Pact Summoning
**Mechanics**: Form contracts with Elsewhere entities, offering your soul or substitutes. Entities grant power, but always collect their due. Substitution markets allow trading others' souls.
**Example**: A summoner bargains for knowledge, substituting a criminal's soul, but the entity returns for payment with interest.

### Fate Threading
**Mechanics**: Sacrifice future possibilities to gain skills, knowledge, or alternate selves. Each thread narrows your destiny, risking determinism.
**Example**: A threader harvests the opportunity cost of a life not chosen, gaining expertise but losing all other futures.

### Colony Summoning
**Mechanics**: Use corpses and biomass to host fungal constructs. Colonies absorb identity and memories, forming collective intelligence. The host risks losing individuality.
**Example**: A colony cultist merges with a fungal network, gaining shared knowledge but losing personal autonomy.
