# Worldbuilding Project

This workspace contains worldbuilding notes, stories, conlangs, and creative systems for multiple fictional worlds. 

## Structure
- `worlds/` — Main world folders (e.g., orrovae, norbela, halcova, etc.)
- `conlang_rules/` — Constructed language rules and references
- `Ideas/` — Concepts, brainstorms, and early drafts
- `writing_hold/` — Writing templates, structure guides, and story rules
- `world_pipeline/` — Scripts and tools for worldbuilding automation
- `archive/` — Old drafts, test files, and deprecated content
- `scripts/` — Automation and deployment scripts

## Getting Started
- Explore each world in `worlds/` for its bible, lore, and stories.
- See `writing_hold/` for templates and narrative structure help.
- Use `archive/` for reference to old or unused material.

## Contributing
- Keep new content organized by world or topic.
- Use consistent naming and folder conventions.
- Archive or delete obsolete files regularly.
