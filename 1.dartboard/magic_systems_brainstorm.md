# Magic Systems Brainstorm

## Category One: Core Binding

### Overview
Core Binding is the practice of harvesting and binding the essence of dead creatures into physical anchors, allowing the holder to summon an echo of what once lived. The echo retains enough of the original to function—walk, fight, remember fragments—but not enough to understand it's incomplete. Most bound echoes believe they're still alive.

### The Core
- Harvestable from anything that dies
- Contains a partial imprint of the original creature—not the whole being
- The echo doesn't know it's dead; it may ask about its family, wonder why it can't go home
- Replaces the concept of a "soul" in this world (final terminology TBD via conlang)

### Anchors
- Physical objects that depict the bound summon
- Forms: carved figurines, painted tiles, etched metal plates, clay tablets with pressed images, small statuettes
- The depiction may form naturally when the core is bound (the object *changes* to show what's inside) or may require artistic skill to create
- Looking at someone's collection shows you what they carry

### Limits & Activation
- Carry as many anchors as you want
- Activation is the bottleneck:
  - Resonance interference: too many active at once causes bleeding/merging between echoes
  - Physical drain: each active summon taxes the holder
- Veterans learn their limits. Amateurs find out the hard way.

### Upkeep: The Resource
Each anchor consumes a resource periodically to keep the echo stable and coherent.

**[RESOURCE NAME TBD]** — Placeholder for worldbuilding. Possibilities discussed:
- Alchemical substance distilled from rare or death-adjacent ingredients
- Crystallized ambient death energy harvested from battlefields, plague sites, execution grounds
- Refined life force from living donors
- Residue from degrading/neglected echoes

**Mechanical notes (apply regardless of final resource choice):**
- Each anchor consumes the resource periodically (daily/weekly depending on echo complexity)
- Powerful or aware echoes burn through it faster
- Neglected anchors (no resource) lead to echo degradation—confusion, fragmentation, eventual dissolution
- Resource can be adulterated, stretched, counterfeited—with consequences (unstable, unpredictable echoes)
- Quality matters; experienced binders can assess it by look, smell, taste
- Creates an economy: harvesters, refiners, merchants, smugglers, black markets
- Scarcity is a plot lever; peace may be expensive for binders, disasters become opportunities

### Decay (Echo Bleed)
One-way bleed from summon to holder. Manifestations include:
- **Phantom sensations**: Feel echoes of how they died. The burned one makes your skin prickle with heat. The drowned one leaves you short of breath.
- **Behavioral drift**: Pick up habits, preferences, fears that aren't yours. Hate a food you used to love. Flinch at dogs for no reason.
- **Memory intrusion**: Flashes of their life. A wife's face you've never seen. A childhood home that isn't yours.

**Awareness accelerates decay.** A summon that figures out it's dead becomes harder to hold—requires more upkeep, more focus, more control.

Stronger or more traumatic cores cost more to carry. A soldier who died screaming is *useful*, but carrying that one costs you.

### Release
Possible. Rarely done. Reasons to keep holding on:
- Money (valuable asset)
- Spite
- Revenge
- Nostalgia
- Love
- Exhaustion (releasing feels like losing them again)

### Opposition
The echoes don't know they're dead, so the moral weight falls on the living:
- **Family members** who recognize a bound echo and can't bear what's been done to it
- **Religious/philosophical groups** who believe the dead deserve passage—this is desecration
- **Former holders** who released their echoes and now crusade against the practice
- **Governments** who want to control the practice, not end it—regulating who gets to keep their dead

### Economy
Black market for rare or powerful cores:
- Poachers hunting creatures for their cores
- Assassins paid to harvest specific targets
- Battlefield scavengers
- Professional harvesters
- Entire trades built around death

### Anomalies
**What happens if you extract a core from something still alive?**
- Something breaks—in the resulting summon, the original, or both
- Loss of self? Split existence?
- These cases are rare and deeply wrong (details TBD)

### Open Questions
- Does the depiction on the anchor form naturally or require artistry? (Or both, depending on method?)
- How long can someone hold a powerful core before the bleed becomes unmanageable?
- Can echoes communicate with each other while dormant in their anchors?
- What do long-held echoes become? Do they degrade, or transform into something else entirely?

## Category Two: Flesh Shaping (Homunculus Crafting)

### Overview
Flesh Shaping is the creation of homunculi—constructed servants built from raw materials and sparked to life with blood. A homunculus never lived, never died, never had a life to lose. It exists because someone built it and animated it.

This sounds more ethical than Core Binding. It isn't, necessarily. Just differently ugly.

### Creation

**Raw Materials**
- Flesh, bone, clay, metal, wax, leather—whatever the crafter works in
- Specializations shape results:
  - Bone-wrights build skeletal servants, light and fast
  - Flesh-sculptors work in meat and muscle, make things that bleed
  - Clay-formers make crude but durable laborers
- The material shapes the result

**The Spark: Blood**
The homunculus runs on blood. Literally.

- **Creation cost**: The crafter bleeds into it during construction. Not a nick—a *letting*. Amount scales with complexity:
  - Simple fetching-hand: a cupful, some dizziness
  - Soldier-construct: enough to leave you pale for a week, eating liver, sleeping twelve hours
  - Mimic (human-passing): crafters have died on the table finishing these, bled out with hands still inside the chest cavity
- The homunculus must be sparked with *the crafter's own blood* during creation

### Conjuring & Tethering

**Tethering**
- A finished homunculus can be bound to a token (similar to Core Binding anchors)
- The homunculus was *made* for the token, not trapped in it
- When dormant, the homunculus collapses into potential, folds into the token
- Where it waits is unclear even to practitioners

**Summoning**
- Activate the token, the homunculus unfolds back into reality
- Fast for simple constructs, slower for complex or large ones—they need time to *become* again
- **Every conjuring costs fresh blood.** The homunculus drinks when it wakes:
  - Small ones: a palm-slice and a minute of feeding
  - Larger/complex ones: significantly more

**Limits**
- Carry many tokens, but maintaining active homunculi costs focus and vitality
- A crafter running six at once is burning through themselves

### Upkeep: The Blood Economy

**Daily Feeding**
- The token drinks too. When you collapse the homunculus back to dormancy, the token takes a drop. Just a drop. Daily maintenance.
- Miss a day: token goes cold, inert. Full conjuring-price to wake it again.
- Miss a week: the homunculus inside starts to degrade.
- Miss a month: what comes out won't be what you put in.

A crafter is *always bleeding*. Even without conjuring, they're feeding tokens. Six constructs means six drops a day, minimum. Morning ritual: a knife and a row of hungry objects.

**The Homunculus Doesn't Care Whose Blood**
It needs the crafter's blood to be *made*, but once it exists, it can be sustained on anyone's.

The temptation is always there:
- You're tapped out, anemic, exhausted
- There's a prisoner in the basement, a beggar who won't be missed
- Animal blood works but makes the construct sluggish, wrong
- Human blood works best. *Your* blood works best of all, but you're running out.

**The Supply Chain**
- **Bloodhouses**: Places where the desperate sell by the pint. Technically legal in some places. Sellers are gaunt, hollow-eyed, always cold. They don't last long. Fresh ones cycle in.
- **Wartime crafters**: Prisoners. Wounded enemies. Civilians in occupied territory. Military Flesh Shapers need a *lot* of fuel.
- **The homunculus knows**: It can smell blood, tell the difference between willing and unwilling, healthy and sick, its maker and a stranger. Some crafters swear their constructs behave differently depending on what they've been fed—more vicious on fear-blood, sluggish on the drugged, *eager* when they've tasted someone they'll meet again.

### What This Does to Crafters
- **Pale. Always.** The healthy glow is for people who keep their blood inside.
- **Hungry.** Constantly eating, body trying to rebuild what they keep giving away.
- **Territorial about blood.** Other people's injuries make them *attentive* in uncomfortable ways. A nosebleed at dinner and every crafter in the room goes still.
- **They know things about blood they shouldn't.** Can tell by smell if someone's sick. Can taste pregnancy, disease, fear. The knowledge seeps in.
- **The old ones are brittle.** Bones thin. Healing slow. They've given too much for too long. Some switch to "volunteers" early. Some hold out until their body forces the choice. Some let a construct drink the last of them.

### Hierarchy of Constructs
- **Tools**: Simple, single-purpose. A hand that fetches. A mouth that repeats messages. Barely present. Cheap to make, cheap to maintain.
- **Servants**: More complex. Follow multi-step instructions, adapt to obstacles, perform labor. The backbone of any crafter's stable.
- **Soldiers**: Built for violence. Expensive in materials and spark. Degrade faster—combat tears them up and they don't heal, they have to be *repaired*.
- **Mimics**: Built to pass as human, or as a specific person. Requires exceptional skill, huge vitality investment. Assassins' tools, spies, replacements. Most societies ban them outright.

### The Homunculus Perspective
They're made to serve. They don't *want* things—except blood. Blood is the one drive that's built in, inescapable.

- Well-fed: loyal, precise, obedient
- Hungry: gets creative about fulfilling its primary need

Neglected constructs have been known to:
- Return to dormancy on their own, drinking the token to survive
- Stand very still near sleeping people
- "Accidentally" cause injuries during tasks
- Simply attack, if starved long enough

This isn't rebellion or malice. It's just *need*—the only need they have—expressing itself when the leash gets loose.

### Moral Angle

**What does Flesh Shaping exploit?**
- **The crafter**: Every homunculus costs a piece of you. Noble self-sacrifice or slow suicide dressed as craft?
- **The materials**: Where do you get the flesh, the bone? Flesh Shapers haunt graveyards, battlefields, slaughterhouses. They make deals with executioners. They show up after disasters with empty carts.
- **The homunculi**: Do they have experiences? They never lived. But complex ones exhibit preferences, aversions, something that looks like pain. Is it real? Does it matter if it acts real?

### Opposition & Social Position
- **Core Binders** view Flesh Shapers as butchers playing with corpse-meat, too squeamish to do the real work of holding an echo
- **Flesh Shapers** view Binders as sentimentalists who can't let go, dragging around prisoners and calling it companionship
- **The public** finds Shapers more openly unsettling—their workshops smell like death
- **The law** regulates differently: Binding requires registration of echoes (they were once citizens). Shaping requires licensing of *crafters* (the product was never a citizen, but the maker is a potential danger)

### Open Questions
- Can a homunculus be given a core fragment from a *person*? What happens?
- What does a homunculus "want"? Do old ones develop drives?
- Can a homunculus be converted to an echo? If you kill one that's been active long enough, is there a core to harvest?
- What happens when a Flesh Shaper dies? Do their homunculi collapse, go rogue, or just wait?

## Category Three: Pact Summoning (The Elsewhere)

### Overview
Somewhere adjacent to reality, there are things. Not dead things—Core Binding covers that. Not made things—Flesh Shaping covers that. These are entities that *exist*, fully and independently, in a place that isn't here. They have their own drives, their own intelligence, their own agendas.

For reasons nobody fully understands, some of them are willing to answer when called.

Unlike Core Binding (dominance over the helpless dead) or Flesh Shaping (creation of servants), Pact Summoning is a *negotiation*. You're not in control. You're making a deal with something that has its own reasons for saying yes.

### The Elsewhere

Mystery is load-bearing here. What's known:

- It's not an afterlife. The dead don't go there.
- It's not a spirit world or reflection of our reality. It's somewhere genuinely alien.
- Time works differently. Entities reference events that haven't happened yet, or remember pacts made with the summoner's ancestors.
- Space is wrong. Descriptions from those who claim to have glimpsed it are contradictory: too many angles, colors that hurt, distance that doesn't correlate with effort.

The entities aren't gods, demons, or faeries—though cultures might use those words. They're *other*. Intelligences that evolved (if that's even the right word) somewhere that isn't here.

### The Pact

**Formation**
- Requires contact: rituals, locations where the boundary thins, objects that resonate with specific entities, or bloodlines that have dealt before
- The entity *chooses* whether to engage. You can call. It doesn't have to answer.
- Terms are negotiated. The entity is at least as smart as you, probably smarter, and has been doing this longer.
- The pact binds both sides. Break it and there are consequences.

**The Price Is You**
The entity wants your core. The same thing a Core Binder would harvest from your corpse. But the Elsewhere entity takes it in installments.

Every summoning, every use of the pact's power, every favor called in—it costs a piece. You feel it:
- A coldness that doesn't warm
- Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix
- The sense that you're *less* than you were yesterday, in a way you can't name

Summoners know exactly what they're paying. That's the horror. It's not a trick, not a hidden clause. The entity is honest: *I will eat you, slowly, and in exchange you get this.* And people say yes anyway.

**The Math of Desperation**
Why agree?
- Power now, death later. For someone with nothing, that's a trade worth making.
- The timeline is negotiable. Small pacts, small bites. You might get decades.
- Some people don't plan to live long anyway. Soldiers, assassins, the terminally ill. The entity offers a way to *matter* before the end.
- Arrogance. The belief you'll find a way out. You won't. But you'll believe it until you don't.

**Substitution**
You can only offer your own core to *one* entity. But you can offer other people's cores as payment.

The entity doesn't care whose—a core is a core. But you have to *deliver*.

- **First-born clauses**: Classic. The child isn't born yet, so you're mortgaging a future you can't see. By the time it comes due, you've had years to love what you promised away.
- **Seventh son of a seventh son**: Rare cores are worth more. One exceptional soul might buy years off your own debt.
- **Prisoners, slaves, sacrifices**: If you can get someone's core to the entity, it counts. How you get it is your problem.

This creates secondary markets. Pact summoners hunting substitutes. Cults breeding or kidnapping to pay founders' debts. Wars fought partly to generate *currency*.

### Breaking the Pact

You can't.

The terms are the terms. You agreed. The entity will collect what it's owed.

*However*:

- **The entity can die.** They're not gods. Powerful, alien, long-lived—but not immortal. Kill your pact-partner and the contract dissolves. You keep whatever's left of your core.
- This is rare. Elsewhere entities are hard to find, harder to hurt. But some summoners spend their whole lives searching for a way to kill what they owe.
- **Other entities might help.** For a price. Faction politics mean your creditor's enemies might deal. Trade one pact for another, one master for another. Out of the pot, into the fire.
- **Early collection.** If the entity decides you're more trouble than you're worth, it can call the debt due. All of it. At once. You don't survive that.

**Evil Genie Escapes**
It *does* happen—rarely—that someone wriggles out through a loophole, a technicality, a desperate gambit the entity didn't anticipate. These cases become legends. They're also why entities have gotten very, very good at writing airtight terms.

### The Summoning

When you call on your pact-partner:
- It *arrives*. Not from an anchor or token—it manifests. The transition is visible, uncomfortable. Air pressure changes. Light bends wrong. The smell of somewhere else.
- It's not your servant. It's your *contractor*. It does what the pact specifies. If you negotiated well, that's a lot. If you didn't, it might technically fulfill the letter while violating the spirit.
- Duration and power depend on pact terms and what you've paid recently.
- It can refuse if you're asking outside the agreement. It can renegotiate. It can leave if the terms allow.

### What They Look Like

Depends on faction, individual nature, and maybe what your mind can process:
- Some are geometric. Wrong angles. Shapes that fold in directions that don't exist.
- Some are almost biological. Too many limbs, or limbs that aren't limbs, or a face close enough to human to be worse than alien.
- Some are sensory rather than visual. A sound. A pressure. A smell that has opinions.
- Some change every time. Some are always exactly the same, down to the shadow.

Summoners in the same faction's service sometimes recognize each other's patrons. Like spotting a uniform, or a brand.

### Contamination

You're not just paying with your core. You're *in contact* with something outside.

- **Perception shifts**: The boundary thins for you. You see cracks. Glimpses of Elsewhere bleeding through. Dreams that aren't dreams.
- **Resonance**: Other entities notice you. You're marked as someone who deals. Some curious, some hungry, some your patron's enemies looking for leverage.
- **Faction drift**: Your patron's nature echoes in you. Not memories—*tendencies*. You start wanting what they want, valuing what they value. The longer the pact, the more you serve their interests without being asked.
- **The door**: If you've given access as part of your terms, you're not always sure when it's open. Gaps. Actions you don't remember. The question of who's driving.

### The Consumed

When a summoner's core is fully consumed:

**The body is still there. The soul is gone.**

What remains:
- A husk that breathes, blinks, maybe eats if you put food in its mouth. Nobody home.
- Or something's *moved in*. The entity, or a piece of it, using the empty vessel, looking out through human eyes.
- Or the body just stops. Heart keeps beating for a while, then doesn't. No violence, no unusual decay. Just vacancy, then nothing.

Different factions leave different remains. The Hungry might leave bodies that look *starved*—not thin, just emptied. The Mirrors might leave bodies that don't move right anymore, like something's trying to remember how limbs work.

## Elsewhere Factions

The entities aren't unified. They have allegiances, rivalries, territories. Summoners catch glimpses—wars referenced obliquely, names spoken with something like fear, requests that clearly serve some larger game—but the full picture is never given. You're a pawn who doesn't know the board.

### The Accountants

They want *order*. Not justice, not fairness—*ledgers that balance*. Every debt paid, every promise kept, every exchange recorded. They invented the pact structure.

- They don't care what you do with the power. They care that the price is paid on time.
- Their summoners tend toward obsessive record-keeping. Counting things. Needing symmetry.
- Might be the "safest" to deal with—predictable, honorable in their way. But their honor is the honor of a loan shark. Miss a payment and they take what's owed, plus interest.
- **What they want**: Unknown. Possibly building something. A structure. A pattern. Every soul a brick in a wall no one can see.

### The Hungry

They want *sensation*. Our world is dense with feeling—physical, emotional, experiential. The Elsewhere is thin. These entities are starving.

- Pacts often include clauses about *experiencing*. The summoner has to feel things—intensely—and the entity feeds on it.
- Their summoners tend toward extremes. Thrill-seekers, hedonists, masochists. People who burn bright because something's drinking the flame.
- Generous with power because they're getting paid in real-time. Every time you use the gift, you *feel* something, and they're right there, mouth open.
- **What they want**: More. Always more. They might not be collecting souls for any purpose—just *eating*. And they're never full.

### The Architects

They want *change*. Specific changes. Moves in a game played across centuries. They give orders that seem arbitrary—stand here, say this, kill him, spare her—and the pattern only becomes visible generations later.

- Their summoners are pieces on a board. Useful, not privy to the strategy.
- Contamination is subtle: you start *thinking* in long timelines. Personal goals feel small. You catch yourself making decisions that serve something larger, and you can't explain why.
- Might be at war with each other, or cooperating on something vast. The summoner never knows which.
- **What they want**: The board to look a certain way. Our world reshaped. Not conquered—*adjusted*. Every collected soul might be a piece removed from play.

### The Mirrors

They want *identity*. They're fascinated by selfhood—the thing that makes you *you*. They collect cores not as currency but as specimens, art, components of something they're building or becoming.

- Pacts often include clauses about *access*. They want to wear you sometimes. See through your eyes. Make your choices. Not possession exactly—more like borrowing.
- Their summoners have the worst contamination: identity bleed. Am I me? Was that my thought? When I wanted that, was it *me* wanting?
- They might be trying to *become* something. Using human cores as templates. Building a self out of stolen pieces.
- **What they want**: To be what we are. Or to understand it. Or to take it apart and see how it works. The souls they collect might be raw material for constructing something that can finally *be*.

### The Absent

They want *nothing*. That's what makes them terrifying. No demands, no hungers, no apparent agenda. They answer when called. They fulfill their terms. They collect what's owed. They never explain why.

- Pacts with them are simple, clean, almost generous. Which makes experienced summoners deeply suspicious.
- Their summoners report the least contamination—but also the least *contact*. The entity does the job and leaves. No presence, no pressure, no bleeding through.
- **What they want**: The only honest answer is "we don't know." That might be the most dangerous answer of all.

### Faction Dynamics

- **The Accountants vs. The Architects**: Most friction. One wants every debt balanced *now*; the other lets ledgers run for centuries if it serves the plan.
- **The Hungry**: Looked down on by others. Addicts. No sophistication. Just *appetite*.
- **The Mirrors**: Feared. What they're doing with the cores is wrong even by Elsewhere standards.
- **The Absent**: Make everyone nervous. You can't predict what you can't understand.

### What Happens to Collected Souls

Unknown. Load-bearing mystery. Hints:
- **The Accountants** file them. Somewhere. For something.
- **The Hungry** consume them. Gone. Used up. Fuel.
- **The Architects** place them. Pieces on a board. Maybe still aware.
- **The Mirrors** wear them. Incorporate them. The entity you're dealing with might be partly made of collected cores.
- **The Absent**: Nobody knows. Nobody's ever found out.

## Category Four: Fate Threading

### Overview

You can only pull versions of yourself from *future* fate-lines. Choices you haven't made yet. Paths you haven't walked.

The moment you make a choice, the other branches die. They're not stored somewhere. They don't become accessible alternate timelines. They simply *stop existing as potential*. You chose. The other options are gone.

This means:
- **No past-branch access.** You decided not to become a soldier at eighteen. That soldier-you doesn't exist. The choice was made. The branch collapsed.
- **Only forward potential.** You can pull from decisions you *will* face. The you that takes the job next month. The you that kills the man threatening your family tomorrow.
- **Always impacting your future.** Every pull severs a path you could still walk. You're not mining your history—you're cannibalizing your becoming.

### The Mechanism

Your fate spreads ahead of you like roots seeking water. Every significant choice you'll face branches into potential futures. Potential yous.

- **You can sense them.** Not clearly—more like pressure. Some futures are heavy, almost-certain. Others are faint, unlikely, barely formed.
- **You can pull them.** Reach forward, grab a version of yourself from a choice you haven't made, drag them into the present.
- **The path closes behind you.** That choice-point is spent. When you reach that moment naturally, the option you pulled from won't exist. You'll have to take a different path—or no path at all.

### What You Can Pull

Any version of yourself that could exist based on *choices you haven't made yet*.

- **Tomorrow you face a duel.** You can pull the you who wins (skilled, confident, bloody-handed). Dead selves can't be pulled—there's nothing there.
- **Next year you might take a job with a merchant house.** You can pull the you who spent a decade there. But then you'll never be able to take that job naturally.
- **You're considering marriage.** You can pull the you who said yes, lived that life. But if you pull the married-you, you've spent that future.

### What You Cannot Pull

- **Past branches.** You didn't become a soldier. That soldier doesn't exist. Gone.
- **Dead futures.** If a fate-line ends in your death, there's no self to extract.
- **Other people.** Your fate-web contains connections to others, but you can't pull *them*. Only yourself.

### The Brutal Math

Young threaders have wide webs. Lots of major choices ahead.

Old threaders have narrow webs. Most choices behind them. Most branches already collapsed through living.

A threader who pulls aggressively in youth might find themselves at forty with almost no remaining futures. Just a thin line leading to a handful of possible deaths.

### The Costs

**Aging**
Each pull costs years. Your body knows you're spending future. Hair grays, joints ache, skin thins.

**Coherence**
You're supposed to *become* those selves. When you rip them out prematurely, you become less. Heavy threaders lose track of their own identity.

**Narrowing Web**
Every pull closes a path. Eventually you're looking at a fate-web that's almost empty—just the thin line of your remaining lifespan.

**Anchoring Load**
The extracted selves are tethered to you. Pull too many and your anchoring spreads thin. Neglected selves degrade—memories corrupting, identity fragmenting.

Soft cap: six to ten stable extractions. Push past that and they start going wrong.

### The Extracted Self

They're you. From a choice you haven't made yet. They remember everything you remember—plus the life they would have lived.

**Their Knowledge**
- Skills you don't have. Training you would have gotten.
- Memories of years you haven't lived. Relationships you haven't formed.
- They know how their story goes—or would have gone.

**Their Relationship to You**
- **Loyal:** They understand. Same person, fundamentally.
- **Resentful:** They had a future. You took it.
- **Superior:** They're the *better* version.
- **Pitying:** They can see what you're going to face.

They're not slaves. They're *you*, with different experiences and their own will.

### Death of an Extracted Self

When they die, that fate-line is destroyed permanently.

- You will never become that person.
- Whatever they knew is lost.
- The choice-point they came from won't exist as an option when you reach it naturally.

### Your Death

If you die, your extracted selves drift.

- Memories corrupt over weeks or months.
- Identity fragments.
- Eventually they become echoes. Walking, talking, but not coherent.

Some extracted selves will do anything to keep you alive. You're their anchor.

### The Horror

You're always eating your future.

Every pull means: *I will never become that person naturally. I will never walk that path.*

The oldest threaders are ghosts before they die. No future left. Just the thin present moment, and the handful of selves they extracted before the well ran dry.

### Open Questions

- Can someone else see your fate-lines? Can depleted threaders be read?
- Can you pull a version that would have made a pact with an Elsewhere entity?
- Can you pull a version that would have become a Flesh Shaper or Core Binder?
- What happens if an extracted self pulls *their own* fate-lines? Do they have any?
- Can two threaders interact with each other's fate-lines if their fates are entangled?

## System Comparison

| | Core Binding | Flesh Shaping | Pact Summoning | Fate Threading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Source** | The dead (cores) | Raw materials + blood | Elsewhere entities | Future versions of yourself |
| **Cost to create/form** | Harvesting a core | Bleeding into creation | Your soul, in installments | Severed fate-line + aging |
| **Cost to summon** | Activation drain, focus | Fresh blood every time | Piece of your core | Path permanently closed |
| **Ongoing cost** | Resource consumption (TBD) | Daily blood feeding | Continued soul erosion | Anchoring load, narrowing web |
| **Corruption** | Echo bleeds into you | You see everything as fuel | Faction drift, identity erosion | Coherence loss, becoming fixed |
| **What you exploit** | The dead who can't refuse | The living who can't afford to refuse | Yourself (or sacrificed others) | Your own potential futures |
| **Worst-case user** | Someone who won't let go | Someone who's stopped caring whose blood | Someone who's sold everyone they love | Someone who's eaten all their tomorrows |
| **Power ceiling** | Limited by what died | Limited by your blood and skill | Highest—but cost matches | Limited by remaining fate-lines |
