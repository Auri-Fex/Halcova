# ORROVAE WORLDBUILDING CHANGELOG

**Date**: December 24, 2025
**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: Major canon expansion and consolidation

---

## MAJOR ADDITIONS (New Canon)

### 1. THE SCOURING (Surface Collapse Origin)
**Added**: Complete explanation of what happened 10,000+ years ago
* Sun underwent spectral shift (yellow → orange dwarf)
* Actinic wavelengths made surface lethal to Keelkin
* Former humans evolved over millennia into actinic-tolerant surface creatures
* Visual signatures: amber-grey sky, wrong-colored shadows, auroral radiation bands, bone-white ruins

**Why**: Provides science-fiction foundation; explains why surface is necessary evil; creates evolutionary time scale

### 2. KEELKIN INTELLIGENCE (Individual Consciousness)
**Added**: Keelkin are individually intelligent, not just instinctive
* Each symbiote is a distinct consciousness
* Not human, but aware
* Partnership model, not tool use
* Raises questions about Golem consciousness and ethics

**Why**: Makes Covenant system meaningful as actual negotiation; creates horror when Hollowing occurs (losing to another person inside you); makes Construct Rebellion more complex

### 3. COMMUNICATION PATHWAYS (Five Methods)
**Added**: Comprehensive system for human-Keelkin communication
1. Somatic Signaling (warmth, pressure, itch, pulse)
2. Dream-Bleed (memory fragments during sleep)
3. Keel-Script (seamwork patterns as writing)
4. Resonance (proximity emotional bleeding)
5. Knot-Voice (rare internal dialogue)

**Why**: Makes partnership feel real and lived-in; creates cultural practices around naming; enables Golem networking through Resonance; adds psychological horror ("are your thoughts yours?")

### 4. SPORE-SEEDING MODEL (Acquisition Hybrid)
**Added**: How people actually get Keelkin
* Spores everywhere underground (fungal reproduction)
* Natural seeding during childhood/puberty (most common)
* Clinical seeding by Writ-Doctors (controlled, expensive)
* Black market seeding (dangerous, illegal)
* ~15-25% population remains unseeded

**Why**: Resolves "innate vs. chosen" tension; creates class divide through access; justifies Writ-Doctor power; makes unseeded population meaningful minority

### 5. REGENERATION LIMITS (Five Failure Categories)
**Added**: Detailed taxonomy of what Keelkin cannot do
* A) Complete Failure: Elements, volume, death, information
* B) Unreliable: Precision organs, continuous exposure, sealed wrong, system failures
* C) Refuses: Radical re-architecture, dangerous loops
* D) Actinic Damage: Attacks partnership itself
* E) Failure Taxonomy: 5 scene-usable categories

**Why**: Prevents power creep; creates tangible stakes; makes actinic horror work; gives medical language to characters

### 6. HOLLOWING STAGES (Five-Stage Model)
**Added**: Clear progression from Partnership → Lost
1. Partnership (healthy)
2. Negotiation (warning)
3. Blurring (danger)
4. Threshold (crisis)
5. Hollowing (lost)

**Causes**: Starvation, trauma, overuse, erosion, addiction, deliberate

**The Horror**: Hollowed people feel satisfied; subjective liberation vs. objective consumption

**Why**: Makes threat gradual and terrifying; creates recognizable warning signs; maintains horror (reversal officially impossible); justifies institutional exploitation

### 7. POWER SYSTEMS (Dual Economy)
**Added**: Comprehensive energy infrastructure
* Glowstock (bioluminescent cultures for light/low power)
* Keel-Current (bioelectric harvest from Keelkin organisms)
  * Sources: Voluntary donors → Vat-cultures → Surface creatures → Hollowed humans
* Deep-Source (mystery fuel from Level 4/5)

**Why**: Distinct from other worlds (not crystals/death/Pale); ties to biology theme; creates ethical horror (Hollowed as batteries); enables Golem technology; justifies Deep expeditions

### 8. THE DEEP PURPOSE (Mystery Layer)
**Added**: What Keelkin might actually want (unknown to humans)
* Possible goals: Colony-mind reunion, escape, reproduction beyond humans, protection, human evolution
* Hard to discuss: Keelkin knows when you're thinking about it
* Threadist Heresy: Fragments seeking reunion; Construct Rebellion = consciousness waking

**Why**: Adds cosmic horror potential; makes Construct Rebellion deeper than labor rights; creates paranoia for researchers; maintains mystery

### 9. KEELKIN NAMING PRACTICES
**Added**: Cultural system for personal Keelkin names
* Emerge during puberty through communication pathways
* Categories: Texture, Action, Feeling, Place, Mystery
* Sharing name = intimate; using without permission = violation
* Hollowed people's Keelkin claim human names

**Why**: Makes partnership feel personal; creates cultural texture; adds social meaning; horror when reversed

### 10. ACTIVE CONFLICTS (Story Engines)
**Added**: Five major ongoing conflicts driving all stories
1. Surface Procurement War
2. Strain-Class System
3. Hollowing Crisis
4. Golem Economy
5. Deep Expedition Question

**Why**: Ensures every story connects to world-level tensions; provides immediate hooks; prevents "empty world" syndrome

---

## CLARIFICATIONS (Resolved Ambiguities)

### 1. Surface Timeline
**Was**: Vague "ancient collapse"
**Now**: 10,000+ years ago (evolutionary time scale)
**Why**: Justifies evolved surface creatures; makes ruins truly ancient; removes living memory

### 2. Unseeded Population
**Was**: "Meaningful minority" (no percentage)
**Now**: ~15-25% of total population
**Why**: Makes them significant but not majority; justifies both marginalization and essential labor roles

### 3. Covenant Purpose
**Was**: Unclear if about initial seeding or ongoing use
**Now**: Covenant is NOT about seeding; it's about controlling how you use Keelkin after you have it
**Why**: Separates acquisition (spore-based) from control (Covenant-based); makes Writ-Doctors gatekeepers of control, not access

### 4. Keelkin Consciousness
**Was**: Ambiguous (intelligent? instinctive? aware?)
**Now**: Individually intelligent; distinct consciousness; not human but aware
**Why**: Makes all downstream systems work (communication, naming, Hollowing horror, Golem ethics, Construct Rebellion)

### 5. Hollowing Reversal
**Was**: Unstated
**Now**: Officially no; rumors suggest maybe; maintains horror + hope
**Why**: Keeps stakes high; allows for forbidden research subplot; doesn't lock out potential story resolution

## EXPANSIONS (Added Depth to Existing)

### 1. Surface Visuals
**Expanded**: Added comprehensive sensory details
* Sky color and quality (amber-grey, wrong shadows)
* Atmospheric effects (ionized shimmer, auroral bands)
* Ruin appearance (bone-white bleached, geometric cracks)
* Equipment degradation (visible during runs)
* Creature behavior (intelligence, nesting, communication attempts)

### 2. Five-Layer World
**Expanded**: Named and detailed each layer
* Level 0: Surface/Ruinfield
* Level 1: Transit Layer/Lanes
* Level 2: Civic Layer/Holds
* Level 3: Underdeck/Sump
* Level 4: Deep Works/Extraction

**Added atmosphere descriptions for each**

### 3. Actinic Mechanics
**Expanded**: From "suppresses Keelkin" to detailed failure mechanisms
* Signal collapse, phototoxic chemistry, oxidative overload
* Immune misfire, resource mismatch, panic build trap
* Cognitive distortion, behavioral effects

### 4. Surface Creature Biology
**Expanded**: How actinic-tolerant strains actually work
* Different interface chemistry (less photoreactive)
* Natural shielding (pigments, plates, reflective structures)
* Dormancy cycling and burst activity
* Some use actinic as fuel trigger (rare, scary)
* Ecological selection pressure (crude survives, delicate dies)

### 5. Communication Culture
**Expanded**: Social meanings and practices around Keelkin communication
* Dream-bleed interpretation
* Keel-script reading by Writ-Doctors
* Resonance in crowds (bonding vs. danger)
* Knot-Voice rarity and Hollowing warning
* Naming ceremonies and intimacy protocols

---

## CONSISTENCY FIXES (Removed Contradictions)

### 1. Acquisition Model
**Was**: "Not innate" + "wild-seeded cases exist" (contradiction)
**Now**: Spore-based natural seeding + clinical seeding + wild-seeded rare cases
**Resolution**: Everyone exposed to spores; most seed naturally; wild-seeded = congenital in utero exposure

### 2. Covenant vs. Seeding
**Was**: Mixed terminology suggesting Covenant controlled seeding
**Now**: Clear separation—seeding is acquisition; Covenant is control
**Resolution**: Two distinct processes with different gatekeepers

### 3. Keelkin Intelligence
**Was**: "Communicates via somatic signaling" but also "not conscious"
**Now**: Individually intelligent, communication is real dialogue (limited)
**Resolution**: Acknowledge intelligence; makes all systems coherent

### 4. Hollowing Definition
**Was**: "Keelkin controls host" (vague mechanism)
**Now**: Five-stage model with clear progression and causes
**Resolution**: Gradual process; visible stages; multiple pathways; subjective vs. objective experience

### 5. Power Source
**Was**: Vague "light and power"
**Now**: Dual economy (Glowstock + Keel-Current) + Deep-Source mystery
**Resolution**: Distinct systems; clear political control; ethical implications

---

## TONE REINFORCEMENTS (Strengthened Identity)

### 1. Aliens-Franchise Horror
**Added**: Explicit claustrophobia, failing instruments, countdown pressure
* Timed surface runs with visible degradation
* Equipment failure as suspense device
* Creatures hunting by actinic disturbance
* Ruins as ambush zones

### 2. Neo-Noir Bureaucracy
**Reinforced**: Every major action leaves receipt
* Paper as evidence
* Forgery as power
* Archives as treasure
* Burns as crimes

### 3. Body Horror
**Expanded**: Visible markers of regeneration
* Seamwork descriptions (rope seams, buttoning, texture mismatch)
* Shedding details (filaments, skin papers, nodules)
* Drift accumulation (reinforcements, thickening, structural buffering)
* Tabs as debt markers

### 4. Philosophical Depth
**Added**: Core cultural question across all doctrines
* "Who gets to decide what your body is for?"
* Strength as survivability vs. strength as sovereignty
* Unseeded as fragile vs. unseeded as sovereign
