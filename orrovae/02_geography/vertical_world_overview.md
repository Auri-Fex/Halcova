# VERTICAL WORLD OVERVIEW

## Overview

Orrovae's civilization exists in five distinct vertical layers, from the lethal surface down to mysterious depths. Each level has unique characteristics, populations, dangers, and economic functions. Understanding this vertical structure is essential to understanding Orrovae society, politics, and daily life.

## THE FIVE LEVELS

### Quick Reference

| Level | Name | Depth | Primary Function | Population Density | Danger Level |
|-------|------|-------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0 | Surface/Ruinfield | 0m (above) | Procurement | None (temporary) | Extreme |
| 1 | Lanes/Transit | 0-500m | Transportation | Low (transient) | High |
| 2 | Holds/Civic | 200-1000m | Habitation | High (permanent) | Moderate |
| 3 | Sump/Underdeck | 500-1500m | Industry/Poor | Moderate | High |
| 4 | Deep Works | 1000-3000m | Extraction | Low (workers) | Extreme |
| 5 | The Deepest | 3000m+ | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |

**Note**: Depth ranges overlap (not all locations same depth). Vertical cities span multiple levels.

## LEVEL 0: SURFACE / RUINFIELD

### Geography

**Extent**: Entire planetary surface
**Accessibility**: Controlled access points (gates, tunnels, quarantine collars)
**Topography**: Pre-Scouring ruins dominating landscape, debris fields, occasional intact structures

**Regional Variation**:
- **Urban Ruins**: Dense pre-Scouring cities (best salvage, most dangerous)
- **Debris Plains**: Flat expanses of rubble (exposed, fast transit)
- **Spore-Forests**: Tall stalks providing shade (reduced actinic, complex terrain)
- **Dead Zones**: Areas of extreme actinic (avoid completely)
- **Water Margins**: Rare springs/pools (all life concentrates, very dangerous)

---

### Characteristics

**Environment**:
- Actinic radiation (lethal, see `actinic_exposure_complete.md`)
- Hostile ecology (adapted predators, see `surface_ecology.md`)
- Unstable ruins (collapse hazard)
- Surface storms (electromagnetic, violent)
- Temperature extremes (no atmosphere regulation)

**Light**:
- Orange sun (K-type star)
- Amber-grey sky
- Permanent auroras
- Shadows wrong colors (blue-violet)
- "Heavy" oppressive light quality

**Air**:
- Breathable (barely)
- Toxic trace compounds
- Spore-laden (respiratory hazard)
- Lower pressure than expected

**Time of Day Matters**:
- **Dawn/Dusk**: Lower actinic (0.5 Scour), best working time
- **Midday**: Peak actinic (1.0-3.0 Scour), deadly
- **Night**: No actinic, but nocturnal predators, complete darkness

**Seasonal Variation**:
- **Spring**: Moderate actinic, spore blooms beginning, breeding season (predators aggressive)
- **Summer**: High actinic (deadly), spore peak, storms
- **Fall**: Best season (moderate actinic, good visibility)
- **Winter**: Low actinic (longer work times), cold, storms

---

### Population

**Permanent**: Zero (uninhabitable)

**Temporary**:
- Runner crews (salvage, actinic goods procurement)
- Guild convoys (large-scale operations)
- Free Crews (pirates, smugglers)
- Military expeditions (securing sites)
- Scientists (ruin excavation, research)

**Duration**:
- Cautious runs: 15-30 minutes
- Standard runs: 30-60 minutes  
- Extended operations: Multiple short runs with underground rest
- Never: Permanent settlement (always fatal eventually)

---

### Economic Function

**Critical Resources** (Surface-only):
1. **Sun-cured salts** (preservation, medicine, chemistry)
2. **Sterile ash** (agriculture, filtration, industry)
3. **Photoreactive resins** (waterproofing, adhesives, construction)
4. **Actinic-treated membranes** (water storage, medical supplies)
5. **Boneglass** (optics, art, Keelkin diagnostics)
6. **Pre-Scouring salvage** (metal, artifacts, knowledge)

**Why Underground Depends on Surface**:
- Actinic goods cannot be produced underground
- No viable alternatives discovered
- Economic necessity despite danger
- Political power flows from surface access control

---

### Access Points

**Official Gates** (Guild/Government Controlled):
- Heavily fortified
- Quarantine Collar mandatory

- No Collar (illegal, dangerous)
- Untaxed
- Unpredictable
- Higher risk (no backup)
- Locations secret

**Emergency Shelters**:
- Scattered surface refuges
- Minimal protection (shade, wind-break)
- Not safe for extended stay
- Used as rest points during long runs

---

### Major Surface Territories

**Ruinfield Sectors** (Named Regions):

**The Shattered Crown**:
- Massive pre-Scouring metropolis ruins
- Tallest structures still standing (landmarks)
- Best boneglass sources
- Most dangerous (Gleaners, Razorwings, unstable structures)
