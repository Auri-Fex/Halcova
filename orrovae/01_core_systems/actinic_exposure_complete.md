# ACTINIC EXPOSURE COMPLETE

## Overview

Actinic radiation is the specific wavelength band introduced by the stellar shift that makes the surface lethal to Keelkin-bearing organisms. This document provides complete mechanical details on exposure effects, time-to-death curves, protection methods, equipment, and the production of actinic goods that make surface exposure economically necessary despite the danger.

---

## WHAT ACTINIC RADIATION IS

### Physical Characteristics

**Wavelength Range**: 
- Primary: 280-320 nanometers (similar to UV-B/UV-C range but shifted)
- Secondary harmful bands: 320-340nm (lower intensity but cumulative)
- Visible component: Orange-tinted light (K-type star output)

**Penetration**:
- **Atmosphere**: High penetration (protective layers stripped/damaged)
- **Water**: Moderate penetration (depth provides some protection)
- **Rock/Soil**: No penetration (even thin layers block completely)
- **Fabric/Clothing**: Minimal protection (unless specially treated)
- **Metal**: Blocks effectively (but conducts heat)
- **Glass**: Transmits (dangerous for windows)

**Intensity Variation**:
- **Time of Day**: Peak at solar noon, lower at dawn/dusk
- **Season**: Higher in summer, lower in winter (planet still has axial tilt)
- **Weather**: Cloud cover reduces intensity (slightly)
- **Latitude**: Higher at equator, lower at poles
- **Altitude**: Increases with elevation (less atmosphere to filter)

**Measurement**:
- Units: "Scour" (colloquial unit of actinic intensity)
- 1 Scour = midday exposure at temperate latitude
- 0.5 Scour = dawn/dusk
- 2-3 Scour = equatorial peak
- 0.1 Scour = heavy overcast
- Measurement tools: Actinic meters (photosensitive chemicals, crystalline sensors)

---

### Why It's Lethal

**Not Simple Radiation Poisoning**:
- Not ionizing radiation (doesn't destroy DNA directly like gamma rays)
- Instead: Photochemical disruption
- Works through multiple cascading mechanisms
- Each mechanism alone survivable; combination lethal

---

## MECHANISMS OF HARM

### Mechanism 1: Keelkin Partnership Disruption (PRIMARY)

**What Happens**:
- Actinic wavelengths interfere with Keelkin-host communication
- Signal pathways degrade (somatic signals become garbled)
- Keelkin becomes "drunk" or "confused"
- Partnership coordination collapses

**Timeline**:
- **0-15 minutes**: Somatic signals weaken (harder to interpret)
- **15-30 minutes**: Keelkin responses erratic (heals wrong things, ignores real damage)
- **30-60 minutes**: Communication breakdown (no signals, or constant noise)
- **60-120 minutes**: Keelkin panic (random emergency responses)
- **120+ minutes**: Partnership failure (Keelkin may die or go dormant)

**Why This Matters**:
- Keelkin-bearers depend on partnership for survival
- Without functional Keelkin: Injuries don't heal, infections spread, existing damage worsens
- Even after returning underground: Partnership may not recover
- Cumulative damage: Each exposure makes next exposure worse

---

### Mechanism 2: Photochemical Cellular Damage

**What Happens**:
- Actinic photons absorbed by proteins and lipids
- Chemical bonds break or rearrange
- Cellular machinery fails
- Accumulates over time

**Affected Systems**:
- **Cell membranes**: Lipid peroxidation (membranes leak)
- **Proteins**: Denaturation (enzymes stop working)
- **DNA**: Cross-linking and breaks (mutations, cell death)
- **Eyes**: Lens proteins damaged (cataracts, blindness)

**Timeline**:
- **0-30 minutes**: Molecular damage begins (no symptoms yet)
- **30-90 minutes**: Cellular stress responses activate
- **90-180 minutes**: Cell death begins (skin, eyes first)
- **3-6 hours**: Organ damage accumulates
- **6-12 hours**: Systemic failure (if still exposed)

---

### Mechanism 3: Oxidative Cascade

**What Happens**:
- Actinic radiation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- ROS attack cellular components
- Antioxidant systems overwhelmed
- Chain reaction of damage

**Effects**:
- Lipid damage (membranes fail)
- Protein damage (functions cease)
- DNA damage (mutations, death)
- Mitochondrial damage (energy crisis)

---

### Mechanism 4: Immune System Misfires

**What Happens**:
- Immune cells activated by cellular damage
- But damage pattern is wrong (not infection, not normal injury)
- Immune system attacks healthy tissue (autoimmune response)
- Inflammation spirals

**Effects**:
- Fever (post-exposure, hours later)
- Inflammation (swelling, pain)
- Tissue damage (immune cells destroying self)
- Sepsis-like syndrome (severe cases)

---

### Mechanism 5: Resource Mismatch

**What Happens**:
- Surface exposure burns through nutrients rapidly
- Especially: Antioxidants, vitamins, minerals
- Keelkin demands repair resources
- Body can't keep up

**Depletion Pattern**:
- Vitamin C, E (antioxidants) - depleted in 30-60 minutes
- B vitamins (energy metabolism) - depleted in 1-2 hours
- Iron (oxygen transport, being destroyed) - critical by 3-4 hours
- Proteins (tissue damage, Keelkin demands) - running low by 6 hours

---

### Mechanism 6: Panic-Build Trap

**What Happens**:
- Keelkin, confused and panicked, tries emergency repairs
- But actinic exposure prevents quality healing
- Keelkin seals frantically, badly
- Creates misbuilds, rot-seals, drift

**Results**:
- Injuries sealed wrong (function lost)
- Infections trapped (sepsis later)
- Optimization spiral (panicked Keelkin over-corrects)
- Tissue built backwards (bone in muscle, etc.)

---

### Mechanism 7: Cognitive Distortion

**What Happens**:
- Brain tissue especially vulnerable
- Actinic exposure → neural signaling errors
- Judgment impaired, perception distorted
- Decision-making collapses

**Symptoms**:
- **Early** (30-60 min): Mild confusion, time perception off
- **Moderate** (60-120 min): Poor judgment, risk-taking
- **Severe** (120+ min): Hallucinations, paranoia
- **Critical** (180+ min): Consciousness fading, coma

---

## TIME-TO-EFFECT CURVES

### Exposure Time vs. Damage (1 Scour Intensity)

**0-15 Minutes: SAFE WINDOW**
- Damage: Minimal
- Keelkin: Functional (slightly strained)
- Symptoms: None
- Recovery: Complete (within hours underground)
- Cumulative Risk: Very Low

**15-30 Minutes: YELLOW ZONE**
- Damage: Minor molecular stress
- Keelkin: Weakening (signals less clear)
- Symptoms: Slight eye irritation, mild discomfort
- Recovery: Full (overnight underground)
- Cumulative Risk: Low

**30-60 Minutes: ORANGE ZONE**
- Damage: Moderate cellular damage
- Keelkin: Erratic (unreliable responses)
- Symptoms: Sunburn feeling, headache, vision blur
- Recovery: 1-3 days (with good nutrition)
- Cumulative Risk: Moderate (repeated exposure dangerous)

**60-90 Minutes: RED ZONE**
- Damage: Severe multi-system stress
- Keelkin: Failing (panic-build begins)
- Symptoms: Blisters, fever (post), cognitive fog
- Recovery: 1-2 weeks (medical care needed)
- Cumulative Risk: High (long-term consequences)

**90-120 Minutes: CRITICAL ZONE**
- Damage: Life-threatening
- Keelkin: Shutdown or death
- Symptoms: Skin blackening, blindness risk, delirium
- Recovery: Weeks to months (permanent damage likely)
- Cumulative Risk: Very High (career-ending)

**120+ Minutes: DEATH ZONE**
- Damage: Lethal
- Keelkin: Dead or dormant
- Symptoms: Multi-organ failure, consciousness loss
- Recovery: Survival uncertain (50/50 even with care)
- Cumulative Risk: Fatal (if survives, severely shortened lifespan)

---

### Intensity Modifiers

**Higher Intensity** (2-3 Scour):
- Divide times by 2-3
- Example: Red Zone at 20-30 minutes instead of 60-90

**Lower Intensity** (0.5 Scour):
- Multiply times by 2
- Example: Yellow Zone at 30-60 minutes instead of 15-30

**Cloud Cover** (0.1 Scour):
- Multiply times by 5-10
- Example: Can work for 2-4 hours before Yellow Zone

**Night** (0 Scour):
- Safe (no actinic radiation)
- But: Surface still dangerous (predators, cold, other hazards)

---

### Cumulative Exposure Effects

**Career Lifespan** (Surface Runners):
- Cautious runners (15-min exposures): 20-30 years
- Standard runners (30-min exposures): 10-15 years
- Aggressive runners (60-min exposures): 5-10 years
- Reckless runners (90+ min exposures): 1-5 years

**Visible Signs of Cumulative Damage**:
- Skin leathery, darkened
- Cataracts (milky eyes)
- Scarring from misbuilds
- Tremors (neural damage)
- Premature aging
- "Surface-touched" appearance (recognizable)

---

## PROTECTIVE MEASURES

### Clothing and Gear

**Standard Surface Suit**:
- **Material**: Treated fungal leather + mineral-impregnated coating
- **Coverage**: Full body (no exposed skin)
- **Protection**: Reduces actinic by 50-70%
- **Duration**: Extends safe time 2-3x
- **Cost**: Expensive (Midworks accessible)
- **Maintenance**: Degrades with exposure (re-treatment needed)

**Eye Protection**:
- **Goggles**: Dark-tinted boneglass or treated mineral lenses
- **Protection**: 80-90% actinic reduction
- **Duration**: Critical (eyes damage fast)
- **Cost**: Moderate to expensive
- **Limitation**: Reduces visibility (trade-off)

**Breathing Apparatus** (Advanced):
- **Filter mask**: Reduces actinic-damaged air particles
- **Protection**: Prevents respiratory irritation
- **Duration**: Filters need replacement
- **Cost**: High
- **Limitation**: Breathing resistance (exhausting)

---

### Chemical Protections

**Actinic-Block Paste**:
- **Application**: Spread on exposed skin (if any)
- **Composition**: Mineral oxides + oils
- **Protection**: 30-50% reduction
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours before sweating off
- **Cost**: Moderate
- **Side Effect**: Skin irritation, greasy feel

**Antioxidant Supplements**:
- **Type**: High-dose vitamins C, E, others
- **Effect**: Reduces oxidative damage
- **Duration**: Take before exposure
- **Cost**: Moderate to high
- **Limitation**: Doesn't prevent, only mitigates

---

### Structural Protections

**Surface Shelters**:
- **Type**: Roofed structures (ruins, constructed)
- **Protection**: Shade reduces actinic 30-50%
- **Benefit**: Extends work time
- **Risk**: Still exposed, just less
- **Use**: Rest stops, staging areas

**Tunnels Near Surface**:
- **Depth**: 2-5 meters below surface
- **Protection**: Complete (rock blocks actinic)
- **Benefit**: Safe staging, quick surface access
- **Risk**: Structural collapse, predator incursion
- **Use**: Runner bases, smuggler hideouts

---

### Timing Strategies

**Dawn/Dusk Runs**:
- **Intensity**: 0.5 Scour (half damage rate)
- **Benefit**: Double safe working time
- **Challenge**: Low light (visibility poor)
- **Risk**: Predator activity peaks (twilight hunters)

**Night Operations**:
- **Intensity**: 0 Scour (no actinic)
- **Benefit**: Unlimited time (actinic-wise)
- **Challenge**: Zero natural light, cold
- **Risk**: Nocturnal predators, navigation difficulty
- **Equipment**: Requires artificial light (gives away position)

**Overcast Days**:
- **Intensity**: 0.1 Scour (10% normal)
- **Benefit**: 5-10x extension of safe time
- **Challenge**: Unpredictable (clouds move)
- **Risk**: Cloud breaks (sudden exposure spike)
- **Strategy**: Experienced runners read weather

**Seasonal Timing**:
- **Winter**: Lower intensity, longer safe times
- **Summer**: Higher intensity, shorter safe times
- **Benefit**: Winter procurement preferred
- **Challenge**: Surface colder, some areas inaccessible

---

## UNSEEDED ADVANTAGE

### Why Unseeded Survive Better on Surface

**No Keelkin to Disrupt**:
- Mechanism 1 (partnership disruption) doesn't apply
- Major advantage eliminated
- Still suffer Mechanisms 2-7 (cellular/oxidative/immune damage)
- But lose the primary killer

**Practical Benefit**:
- Unseeded can stay on surface 2-3x longer before critical zone
- Example: 90-120 minutes instead of 30-60 minutes
- Still dangerous, but survivable window larger

**Drawbacks**:
- No regeneration (injuries permanent without medical care)
- No infection fighting (vulnerable to surface diseases)
- Slower recovery underground (no Keelkin acceleration)

**The Trade-Off**:
- Underground: Keelkin is massive advantage (healing, survival)
- Surface: Keelkin is liability (partnership fails, makes exposure worse)
- Career choice: If life is surface-focused, unseeded better
- If life is underground-focused, Keelkin better

**Political Argument**:
- Unseeded advocates: "We're free on surface, you're slaves to underground"
- Keelkin advocates: "You die from minor injuries, we heal and thrive underground"
- Both partially right

---

## QUARANTINE COLLAR PROTOCOL

### What It Is

**The Collar**:
- Checkpoint before returning underground
- Mandatory decontamination and observation
- Prevents actinic sickness spread
- Enforced at all surface access points

**Name Origin**: 
- "Collar" refers to the ringed chambers
- Also: "collar" as restraint (you're held here)

---

### Stages of Collar Protocol

**Stage 1: STRIP (Decontamination)**

**Procedure**:
- Remove all surface gear
- Discard or quarantine contaminated items
- Full body bleach bath (kills surface microbes, actinic-affected cells)
- Hair washing (or shaving if heavily exposed)
- Equipment sterilization (what's kept)

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

**Purpose**: 
- Remove surface contaminants
- Kill actinic-damaged cells that could spread infection
- Prevent rot-seal (surface wounds often contaminated)

**Discomfort**: 
- Bleach burns (chemical irritation)
- Cold water (often unheated)
- Rough handling (efficiency over comfort)
- Public nudity (tier-dependent - upper tiers get privacy)

---

**Stage 2: HOLD (Observation)**

**Procedure**:
- Isolated holding cells (individual or group)
- No Keelkin contact with unexposed people
- Medical observation (watching for actinic sickness symptoms)
- Temperature monitoring (fever indicates problems)
- Keelkin behavior assessment (is partnership recovering?)

**Duration**: 
- Minimum: 6 hours (if minimal exposure)
- Standard: 12-24 hours (typical runs)
- Extended: 48-72 hours (heavy exposure or symptoms)

**Conditions**:
- Bare cells (easy to sterilize)
- Basic food/water (rations only)
- Sanitation (communal or bucket)
- No visitors (contamination risk)
- Tier doesn't matter here (everyone equal in Collar)

---

**Stage 3: EVALUATE (Medical Clearance)**

**Procedure**:
- Writ-Doctor examination
- Keelkin signal test (is partnership functional?)
- Injury assessment (what needs treatment?)
- Fever check (infection/immune response?)
- Eye examination (actinic damage?)
- Skin examination (blistering, blackening?)

**Possible Outcomes**:

**A) CLEARED**:
- Partnership functional
- No dangerous symptoms
- Released to general population
- May still need follow-up care

**B) EXTENDED HOLD**:
- Symptoms concerning but not critical
- Need more observation
- Hold for another 24-48 hours

**C) MEDICAL INTERVENTION**:
- Partnership failing
- Severe symptoms
- Transferred to clinic
- May require Keelkin stabilization, sepsis treatment, etc.

**D) QUARANTINE** (Rare, Severe):
- Partnership death suspected
- Highly contaminated
- Contagious condition
- Isolated indefinitely (may be fatal)

---

### Enforcement

**Who Runs Collar**:
- Gate authorities (government or guild)
- Writ-Doctors (medical staff)
- Guards (enforcement, prevent escape)

**Mandatory for**:
- All surface returnees (no exceptions)
- Anyone with surface exposure
- Cargo/salvage (also decontaminated)

**Penalties for Evasion**:
- Criminal charges (public health threat)
- Permanent gate ban (can't use official access)
- Seizure of goods (contraband if not Collar-cleared)
- Execution (extreme jurisdictions, if contagion risk)

**Black Market Bypass**:
- Illegal entry points (avoid Collar)
- Bribed guards (look the other way)
- False documentation (claim no surface exposure)
- Risk: Disease spread, rot-seal epidemics, legal consequences

---

### Social Dynamics

**Class Differences**:

**Upper Tier**:
- Private Collar facilities
- Individual cells (privacy)
- Better food during Hold
- Faster processing
- Respectful treatment

**Lower Tier**:
- Communal Collar pens
- Group holding (dozens together)
- Minimal food
- Slow processing (may wait days)
- Rough treatment

**Runners**:
- Know the system (regular visitors)
- Prepare mentally (accept the misery)
- Some develop relationships with guards (easier passage)
- Still hate it (degrading, uncomfortable)

**Emotional Impact**:
- Humiliating (strip, public bath, inspection)
- Necessary (everyone knows it saves lives)
- Bonding (shared suffering)
- Resentment (class differences visible)

---

## ACTINIC GOODS PRODUCTION

### Why Surface Exposure is Economically Necessary

**The Paradox**:
- Surface is lethal
- But surface exposure produces essential goods
- Underground civilization depends on these goods
- No alternative source exists (currently)

**Economic Driver**:
- High demand (everyone needs actinic goods)
- Limited supply (dangerous to produce)
- High prices (risk premium)
- Guild monopolies (control access)
- Political power (who controls surface controls economy)

---

### Categories of Actinic Goods

#### 1. SUN-CURED SALTS

**Production**:
- Surface mineral deposits exposed to actinic radiation
- Chemical transformation occurs (1-7 days exposure)
- Salts become sterile, stable, chemically altered
- Harvested and transported underground

**Uses**:
- Food preservation (antibacterial)
- Medical antiseptic (wound cleaning)
- Chemical reagents (alchemy, tanning)
- Seal-paste ingredient (bureaucratic seals)

**Varieties**:
- White salt (general purpose, common)
- Blue salt (high purity, medical grade, expensive)
- Black salt (industrial, corrosive, cheap)
- Red salt (rare, specialized uses, very expensive)

**Market**:
- Controlled by Salt Guilds
- Rationed in some jurisdictions
- Smuggling common (valuable, portable)
- Quality varies (adulteration problems)

---

#### 2. STERILE ASH

**Production**:
- Surface organic matter (dead plants, animals)
- Actinic exposure breaks down all microbes
- Leaves behind sterile ash (pure carbon + minerals)
- Collected from burn sites, ruins

**Uses**:
- Soil amendment (underground agriculture)
- Filtration medium (water, air)
- Carbon source (metalworking, chemistry)
- Cosmetics (eye darkening, ritual paint)

**Quality Grades**:
- Pure ash (white, fine) - expensive, medical/cosmetic
- Standard ash (grey, mixed) - agricultural
- Crude ash (black, contaminated) - industrial

**Market**:
- Abundant but labor-intensive to collect
- Guild control less tight (more Free Crew)
- Used in massive quantities (agriculture)

---

#### 3. PHOTOREACTIVE RESINS

**Production**:
- Specific surface plants/minerals
- Actinic exposure triggers polymerization
- Forms hard, waterproof, chemically resistant resin
- Harvested as semi-liquid, solidifies underground

**Uses**:
- Waterproofing (clothing, structures)
- Adhesives (construction, repairs)
- Coatings (preservative, protective)
- Electrical insulation (advanced tech)

**Varieties**:
- Clear resin (optical applications, expensive)
- Amber resin (general adhesive, common)
- Black resin (waterproofing, cheap)
- Flexible resin (specialized, rare)

**Market**:
- Essential for construction industry
- Guild monopoly (dangerous to harvest)
- Quality critical (poor resin fails catastrophically)

---

#### 4. ACTINIC-TREATED MEMBRANES

**Production**:
- Animal hides, fungal sheets, mineral films
- Exposed to actinic (controlled duration)
- Becomes tougher, more flexible, microbe-resistant
- Must be perfectly timed (over-exposure = brittleness)

**Uses**:
- Water storage (bladders, tanks)
- Air seals (breathing apparatus, airlocks)
- Medical applications (bandages, surgical barriers)
- Clothing (protective gear)

**Quality**:
- Timing is everything (too little = weak, too much = brittle)
- Expert harvesting required
- High failure rate (much waste)
- Premium prices for good quality

---

#### 5. BONEGLASS

**Production**:
- Pre-Scouring glass (from ruins)
- Actinic exposure over millennia
- Organic quality (melted, flowed, transformed)
- Harvested from ruins, shaped underground

**Uses**:
- Windows (rare, expensive)
- Lenses (optics, scientific instruments)
- Art objects (status symbol)
- Keelkin diagnostic tools (certain strains visible through boneglass)

**Market**:
- Extremely valuable
- Ruin-specific (not all glass becomes boneglass)
- Guild-controlled (ruin access restricted)
- Counterfeit problem (regular glass passed as boneglass)

---

#### 6. SURFACE-FORGED METALS

**Production**:
- Metal ores exposed to actinic
- Oxidation patterns different from underground
- Some alloys only possible with actinic
- Rust-lace (decorative corroded metal from ruins)

**Uses**:
- Specific alloys (electronics, precision tools)
- Decorative metals (rust-lace valued by some)
- Chemical catalysts (actinic-altered surface)

**Market**:
- Niche (specialized uses only)
- More valuable for scarcity than function
- Ruin salvage (pre-Scouring metals)

---

### Harvesting Operations

**Guild Operations** (Official):
- Large convoys (30-100 people)
- Heavy protection (guards, equipment)
- Specific sites (claimed territories)
- Regular schedules (predictable)
- Expensive (overhead high)
- Legal (taxed, regulated)

**Free Crew Operations** (Pirates):
- Small teams (3-10 people)
- Light, fast (in and out quickly)
- Opportunistic sites (go where guilds aren't)
- Irregular (unpredictable timing)
- Cheap (minimal overhead)
- Illegal (untaxed, unregulated, dangerous)

**Solo Runners** (Desperate):
- One person
- Minimal equipment
- High-risk, high-reward (or death)
- Scavenging (not large-scale harvesting)
- Either very poor or very brave
- Often both

---

### Pricing and Economics

**Price Factors**:
- Exposure time required (longer = more dangerous = higher price)
- Quality (precision timing = higher price)
- Scarcity (rare materials = higher price)
- Demand (essential goods = higher price)
- Guild control (monopoly = higher price)

**Social Impact**:
- Rich: Can afford best actinic goods (high quality salts, resins, boneglass)
- Poor: Make do with crude versions (contaminated, weak)
- Inequality: Visible in quality of preserved food, clothing, medicine

**Political Control**:
- Surface access = economic power
- Guilds control access points
- Free Crews threaten monopoly
- Military operations (secure valuable sites)
- Wars fought over ruin-rich territories

---

## ACTINIC SICKNESS (Post-Exposure Syndrome)

### Symptoms

**Immediate** (0-6 hours post-exposure):
- Skin redness, blistering (if severe exposure)
- Eye pain, tearing, vision blur
- Nausea (from cellular damage)
- Cognitive fog (brain exposure)

**Delayed** (6-24 hours):
- Fever spike (immune response)
- Chills, sweating
- Full-body ache (inflammation)
- Keelkin distress signals (erratic pulses)

**Recovery Phase** (24-72 hours):
- Fever breaks
- Skin peeling (shedding damaged cells)

- Appetite returns
- Fatigue persists

**Chronic** (if repeated exposure):
- Keelkin degradation (signals weaker over time)
- Skin leathering (permanent changes)
- Eye damage (cataracts forming)
- Neurological issues (tremors, memory problems)
- Shortened lifespan

---

### Treatment

**Standard Protocol**:
- Bleach bath (Collar required)
- Hydration (replace fluids)
- Nutrition (antioxidants, vitamins, minerals)
- Rest (allow Keelkin to work)
- Monitoring (watch for complications)

**Advanced Care** (Clinic):
- Keelkin stabilization (if partnership failing)
- Intravenous fluids (if severe dehydration)
- Immunosuppression (if autoimmune response)
- Antibiotics (if secondary infection)
- Pain management

**Complications**:
- Rot-seal (sealed infection from surface wound)
- Keelkin death (partnership failure)
- Sepsis (systemic infection)
- Blindness (if eyes severely damaged)
- Death (if exposure was Death Zone)

## SCENARIOS AND EXAMPLES

### Scenario 1: Standard Salvage Run (Success)

**Team**: 5 guild runners
**Target**: Ruin cluster, known boneglass site
**Timing**: Dawn departure, 15-minute exposure planned

**Execution**:
- Leave underground at pre-dawn (0.2 Scour)
- Travel to site (10 minutes)
- Harvest boneglass (15 minutes work)
- Return to underground (10 minutes travel)
- Total exposure: 35 minutes (Yellow Zone)

**Result**:
- Successful harvest
- Minor symptoms (eye irritation, fatigue)
- Collar Hold: 12 hours
- Full recovery: 2 days
- Profit: Good (boneglass valuable)

---

### Scenario 2: Extended Run (Disaster)

**Team**: Solo runner (desperate, poor judgment)
**Target**: Salt deposits, distant site
**Timing**: Midday (1 Scour - bad decision)

**Execution**:
- Depart at dawn (good)
- Travel takes longer than expected (30 minutes)
- Arrives at midday (1 Scour - now exposed)
- Harvests for 45 minutes (doesn't notice cognitive distortion)
- Total exposure: 75 minutes (Red Zone approaching Critical)

**Result**:
- Severe actinic sickness
- Keelkin near-failure (panic builds)
- Barely makes it back underground
- Collar Hold: Extended 48 hours (medical concern)
- Permanent eye damage (cataracts beginning)
- Career: Possibly ended
- Profit: Marginal (sells salt to pay medical bills)

---

### Scenario 3: Unseeded vs Keelkin-Bearer (Comparison)

**Team**: Mixed crew, 2 unseeded + 2 Keelkin-bearers
**Target**: Sterile ash collection
**Timing**: Overcast day (0.1 Scour)

**Execution**:
- All depart together
- Work for 90 minutes (all stay)
- Unseeded: Tired but functional (Yellow Zone for them)
- Keelkin-bearers: Orange Zone (showing strain)

**Decision Point**: Keep working or return?

**Unseeded say**: "We can stay longer" (true for them)
**Keelkin-bearers say**: "We need to go" (Keelkin struggling)

**Result**:
- Team compromises (return at 90 minutes)
- Unseeded: Fine (could have stayed 2+ hours)
- Keelkin-bearers: Symptomatic (needed to leave)
- Demonstrates unseeded advantage on surface
- But: Unseeded got minor cut, will scar permanently (no Keelkin to heal)
