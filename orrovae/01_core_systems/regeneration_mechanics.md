# REGENERATION MECHANICS

## Overview

This document provides complete mechanical and biological details for how Keelkin accelerates tissue repair, what it can and cannot regenerate, the costs and limitations, and the visible consequences of repeated healing. This is the core "magic system" of Orrovae made concrete and usable.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### The Three Rules

1. **Keelkin is an accelerated repair partner, not a reality editor**
   - It speeds up and guides natural healing processes
   - It cannot create matter from nothing
   - It requires viable living substrate to work from

2. **Quality depends on inputs and conditions**
   - Perfect healing requires: proper nutrients, stable environment, time, and clean tissue
   - Emergency healing sacrifices quality for speed
   - Tradeoffs are unavoidable

3. **Every repair leaves a receipt**
   - Healing is construction, not restoration
   - Physical marks accumulate
   - Drift compounds over time
   - No healing is truly invisible

---

## WHAT KEELKIN CAN REGENERATE

### Category A: Full Regeneration (High Success)

These tissues regenerate reliably with good fidelity if conditions are met.

**1. Skin and Superficial Tissue**
- **Success Rate**: 95%+
- **Time**: Hours to days
- **Quality**: Good to excellent with proper nutrition
- **Visible Receipts**: 
  - Seamwork (rope-like collagen ridges beneath skin)
  - Texture mismatch (too smooth or too rough)
  - Slight color variation
  - Fingerprint ridge alterations
- **Notes**: Easiest tissue to regenerate; still leaves marks

**2. Muscle Tissue**
- **Success Rate**: 90%+
- **Time**: Days to weeks
- **Quality**: Good functional recovery
- **Visible Receipts**:
  - Fiber orientation changes (strength/flexibility tradeoff)
  - Scar tissue interwoven (visible striations)
  - Possible strength enhancement if optimized
- **Notes**: Function returns faster than appearance normalizes

**3. Blood Vessels**
- **Success Rate**: 95%+
- **Time**: Hours to days
- **Quality**: Excellent (Keelkin prioritizes this)
- **Visible Receipts**:
  - "Buttoning" (dot-trails where vessels reattach)
  - Spider-web patterns under skin
  - Warmth differences in rebuilt areas
- **Notes**: Critical for all other healing; Keelkin excels here

**4. Bone (Simple Fractures)**
- **Success Rate**: 85%+
- **Time**: Weeks to months (faster than normal)
- **Quality**: Good structural integrity
- **Visible Receipts**:
  - Callus formation (thickened areas)
  - Slight shape changes
  - Increased density at break site
  - Possible joint stiffness
- **Notes**: Keelkin accelerates but doesn't skip stages

**5. Peripheral Nerves**
- **Success Rate**: 70-80%
- **Time**: Weeks to months
- **Quality**: Variable (function > fidelity)
- **Visible Receipts**:
  - Altered sensation (numbness, tingling, hypersensitivity)
  - Temperature perception changes
  - Possible chronic pain loops
  - Nerve cross-threading (signals rerouted)
- **Notes**: Slow process; Keelkin can't rush this well

**6. Teeth (Surprising Success)**
- **Success Rate**: 60-70%
- **Time**: Months
- **Quality**: Functional but different
- **Visible Receipts**:
  - Color mismatch (often darker)
  - Shape approximation (not exact)
  - Enamel quality reduced
  - Sensitivity changes
- **Notes**: Rare capability; requires specific strain types and nutrients

---

## ABSOLUTE LIMITS: WHAT KEELKIN CANNOT DO

### 1. Cannot Create Elements

**The Hard Wall**:
- Keelkin manipulates molecules, not atoms
- Cannot conjure: iron, calcium, iodine, sodium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, selenium
- Cannot create essential fatty acids
- Cannot create water

**Practical Consequence**:
- Repair requires inputs
- "Repair rations" are real necessity
- Mineral deficiency = healing failure
- Starvation = death despite Keelkin

**Political Consequence**:
- Those who control nutrition control healing
- Ration theft is life-or-death crime
- Class divide is nutritional access

---

### 2. Cannot Create Volume from Nothing

**The Physics Problem**:
- Severe blood loss: Keelkin can clamp/seal but not replace lost volume
- Dehydration: Cannot create water
- Mass loss: Cannot create tissue mass without feedstock

**What Keelkin Does Instead**:
- Triages (keeps core alive, abandons periphery)
- Seals (stops further loss)
- Waits (for inputs to arrive)

**Time Criticality**:
- Hemorrhage: Minutes to death without volume replacement
- Dehydration: Days to critical failure
- Starvation: Weeks to collapse

---

### 3. Cannot Resurrect the Dead

**The Definition of Death**:
- **Cellular death**: If cells are dead (not dying, but dead), Keelkin cannot restart them
- **Brain death**: If consciousness is gone, cannot rebuild it
- **Systemic collapse**: If circulation stopped too long, tissue death cascades

**The Gray Zone** (Clinical Death vs. True Death):
- Keelkin can extend the "saveable window" (minutes → tens of minutes)
- Can survive longer without oxygen than normal
- Can restart systems if core hasn't failed completely
- BUT: There's still a hard limit

**The Timing**:
- Normal human: 4-6 minutes without oxygen = brain damage
- Keelkin bearer: 8-15 minutes possible (strain-dependent)
- Beyond that: Death is death

---

### 4. Cannot Reconstruct Lost Information

**The Memory Problem**:
- Keelkin can regrow brain tissue
- Cannot recreate exact neural patterns
- Memories: Gone
- Personality: Changed
- Skills: May be lost or altered

**The Identity Question**:
- If you survive massive brain damage, are you still you?
- Keelkin keeps the body alive
- The person may be lost anyway

**Horror Implication**:
- "He survived" ≠ "He's himself"
- Families face stranger in familiar body
- Some consider this worse than death

---

### 5. Cannot Heal in Impossible Conditions

**Environmental Requirements**:
- **Temperature**: Too cold → Keelkin goes dormant; too hot → fever spiral
- **Oxygen**: Need stable oxygen or repair collapses
- **Pressure**: Extreme pressure changes disrupt Keelkin
- **Actinic**: Surface radiation suppresses/destabilizes all healing
- **Toxins**: Active poisoning prevents repair

**The Surface Problem**:
- Actinic conditions attack Keelkin itself
- Healing becomes unreliable
- Misbuilds accumulate
- "Surface wounds don't heal right"

---

### 6. Cannot Prevent Aging (Mostly)

**Keelkin and Longevity**:
- Does NOT grant immortality
- Does NOT prevent aging
- DOES repair accumulated damage → slower aging
- Life extension: 10-30% longer lifespan typical
- "Longlife" strains claim more (disputed)

**Why Aging Still Happens**:
- Telomere shortening
- Epigenetic changes
- Accumulated cellular errors
- Keelkin can't fix everything

**The Irony**:
- You live longer
- More time for drift to accumulate
- Oldest people least recognizable

---

## REGENERATION OPERATING MODES

Keelkin has three decision-making frameworks it uses based on threat assessment and available resources.

---

### Mode 1: STABILIZE (Emergency Triage)

**When Used**:
- Immediate life threat
- Multiple injuries
- Severe blood loss
- Shock state
- Poor conditions (cold, hypoxia, dehydration)

**Keelkin Priorities**:
1. Stop bleeding (clamp vessels)
2. Maintain blood pressure (vasoconstriction)
3. Protect brain/heart (sacrifice periphery)
4. Prevent shock (stress hormone modulation)
5. Buy time (defer non-critical repairs)

**What This Looks Like**:
- Bleeding stops fast (clotting accelerated)
- Extremities cold (blood shunted to core)
- Pain blunted (shock prevention)
- Host feels "numb, distant"
- No visible repair happening yet

**Duration**: Minutes to hours
**Transition**: When threat passes and conditions improve → Seal mode

**Risks**:
- Limb loss if peripheral blood flow cut too long
- Crude clotting may need surgical correction later
- Debt accumulates (repair postponed, not cancelled)

---

### Mode 2: SEAL (Closure Priority)

**When Used**:
- Stabilization achieved
- Conditions marginal (not good, but survivable)
- Need to prevent infection
- Time pressure (surface run, combat ongoing)
- Limited resources

**Keelkin Priorities**:
1. Close all open wounds
2. Prevent contamination entry
3. Restore basic barrier function
4. Accept imperfect closure
5. Defer quality for speed

**What This Looks Like**:
- Wounds close over hours/days
- Scar tissue heavy
- "Sealed but not healed"
- Pain continues (damage still there)
- Infection risk if sealed dirty

**Duration**: Hours to days
**Transition**: When conditions improve → Build mode

**Risks**:
- **Rot-seal** (sealing over infection) = major danger
- Misaligned tissue (needs correction later)
- Heavy scarring guaranteed
- Functional compromise

**The Field Repair Problem**:
- This is what happens in the Lanes, on the surface, in combat
- Fast but imperfect
- "Survived" ≠ "healed well"
- Creates repair debt

---

### Mode 3: BUILD (Quality Reconstruction)

**When Used**:
- Stable conditions
- Good nutrition available
- Time available
- Covenant permissions clear
- Clinic oversight (ideally)

**Keelkin Priorities**:
1. Clean and correct previous seals
2. Rebuild tissue layers properly
3. Restore function
4. Match original architecture (if possible)
5. Minimize drift (if Covenant demands)

**What This Looks Like**:
- Slow, deliberate reconstruction
- Tissue remodeled section by section
- Host feels constant low-level ache/pressure
- High calorie/nutrient demand
- Sleep need increases
- Mood changes (Keelkin focus)

**Duration**: Days to weeks to months
**Quality Factors**:
- Nutrition (better food = better results)
- Rest (sleep deprivation ruins quality)
- Covenant guidance (specifications followed)
- Clinic patterning (expert shaping)
- No new injuries (interruption restarts process)

**Visible Process**:
- Seamwork appears and is refined
- Swelling comes and goes
- Shedding occurs (black threads, skin papers)
- Scabs form and fall off in unusual patterns
- "Breathing" sensation as tissue reorganizes

**The Trade-Off Choice** (Covenant-Driven):
- Speed vs. Quality
- Function vs. Appearance  
- Original form vs. Optimized form
- Pain tolerance vs. Anesthesia depth

---

## DECISION TREE: MODE SELECTION

**Keelkin assesses every second**:

```
Is host dying? 
├─ YES → STABILIZE
└─ NO → Are conditions hostile?
    ├─ YES (combat/surface/cold/hypoxic) → SEAL
    └─ NO → Are resources available?
        ├─ YES (food/water/rest/warmth) → BUILD
        └─ NO → SEAL (conserve mode)
```

**Covenant Override**:
- Host can force BUILD during marginal conditions
- Risks: poor quality, Keelkin stress, possible failure
- Keelkin may refuse if survival threatened

**Hollowing Warning**:
- If Keelkin makes these decisions without host input
- Or if host always defers to Keelkin judgment
- Partnership shifts → Hollowing begins

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFIERS

### Temperature Effects

**Cold (Below 15°C)**:
- Keelkin slows (energy conservation)
- Stabilize mode only
- Build quality collapses
- Risk: Keelkin dormancy → death

**Optimal (18-25°C)**:
- All modes function normally
- Best quality outcomes

**Hot (Above 30°C)**:
- Keelkin accelerates (metabolic stress)
- Fever risk increases
- Panic build tendency
- Risk: Keelkin fever spiral

**Extreme Heat (Above 40°C)**:
- Keelkin begins shutdown
- Erratic behavior
- Misbuilds
- Risk: Keelkin death

---

### Oxygen Effects

**Hypoxic (Poor Air Quality)**:
- Keelkin prioritizes core over periphery
- Seal mode preferred
- Build quality reduced
- Chronic exposure → permanent optimization (barrel chest, thick blood)

**Normal (Good Air)**:
- All functions normal

**Hyperoxic (Rich Air - Rare)**:
- Slight improvement in Build quality
- Faster healing
- But: Oxidative stress long-term

---

### Actinic Exposure (Surface)

**See separate document: `actinic_exposure_complete.md`**

**Quick Summary**:
- Suppresses Keelkin function
- Causes misbuilds
- Triggers panic sealing
- Creates photoreactive chemistry issues
- Time-limited survival

---

### Pressure Effects

**High Pressure (Deep Works)**:
- Keelkin adapts over time
- Acute pressure changes dangerous
- Rapid ascent → "bends" worse for Keelkin-bearers

**Normal Pressure**:
- Standard function

**Low Pressure (Rare)**:
- Keelkin struggles
- Fluid balance issues
- Healing quality degrades

---

### Hydration Status

**Dehydrated**:
- Keelkin enters clamp mode
- Seal only, no Build
- "Dry healing" (brittle, prone to failure)
- Tabs form more readily

**Normal**:
- All functions operate

**Overhydrated** (Rare):
- Slight improvement
- But: Electrolyte imbalance risk

---

## NUTRITION AND REPAIR QUALITY

### Iron Sufficiency

**Deficient**:
- Anemia worsens
- Keelkin rations oxygen
- Healing crawls or stops
- Fatigue extreme
- Functional priority only (crude)

**Sufficient**:
- Normal healing
- Good oxygenation

**Excess**:
- No benefit
- Potential toxicity

**Sources**: Meat (rare luxury), blood-moss (cultivated), iron supplements (expensive)

---

### Protein Sufficiency

**Deficient**:
- Cannot build tissue mass
- Keelkin uses host muscle as feedstock (wasting)
- Healing craters
- Muscle loss accelerates

**Sufficient**:
- Normal healing

**Excess**:
- Faster healing
- Better quality
- But: Expensive underground

**Sources**: Protein vats (Spore House), shellstock, crawlstock, cultured sheets

---

### Mineral/Electrolyte Balance

**Deficient** (Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, etc.):
- Bone healing fails
- Nerve healing fails
- Enzyme function collapses
- Keelkin becomes erratic
- Fever risk

**Sufficient**:
- Normal function

**Sources**: Kelp-analogs, mineral water (deep sources), supplements (rationed)

---

### Essential Fatty Acids

**Deficient**:
- Cell membrane quality poor
- Nerve damage hard to repair
- Inflammation increases
- Brain function declines
- Skin/hair brittle

**Sufficient**:
- Better repair quality
- Reduced inflammation

**Sources**: Rare fish-analogs, seed oils (expensive), deep-fat reserves (guarded)

---

## DAMAGE PATTERNS AND ACCUMULATION

### First Injury at a Site

**Response**: Clean, efficient healing
**Quality**: Best possible for conditions
**Drift**: Minimal

---

### Second Injury (Same Site)

**Response**: Faster but cruder
**Quality**: Reduced (10-20% worse)
**Drift**: Slight reinforcement begins
**Visible**: Seamwork crosses previous seamwork

---

### Third+ Injury (Same Site)

**Response**: Very fast but very crude
**Quality**: Significantly reduced (30-50% worse)
**Drift**: Obvious optimization (thickening, hardening)
**Visible**: Heavy layered scarring, joint stiffness, altered shape
**Chronic Issues**: Pain, reduced range of motion, tabs

---

### Whole-Body Accumulation

**Pattern**: 
- More injuries → More seamwork → More drift → Less original appearance
- Old veterans: Walking maps of their history
- Every fight, every fall, every wound: Receipt remains

**The Receipt Doctrine**:
- "What matters is what you can show you endured"
- Seamwork as proof of survival
- Social: Some display proudly, others hide

**The Hollowing Risk**:
- More injuries → More Keelkin intervention → More drift → Partnership tilts → Hollowing approaches

---

## SPECIAL CASES

### Pregnancy and Birth

**Keelkin During Pregnancy**:
- Protects fetus (if compatible)
- Reduces miscarriage risk
- Complicated delivery healing faster
- BUT: Fetus may spontaneously seed (wild-seeding)

**Birth with Keelkin**:
- Childbirth damage heals rapidly
- Less maternal mortality
- But: Drift from pregnancy is permanent
- Body never quite the same

**Wild-Seeded Babies**:
- Born with Keelkin already integrated
- Medical/political crisis (no Covenant, no consent)
- Often develop unusual abilities
- Social stigma varies by culture
- Dangerous (fever risk in infancy)

---

### Deliberate Self-Harm

**Keelkin Response**:
- Follows Covenant (will heal if not forbidden)
- No judgment (Keelkin has no morality)
- Repeated self-harm → drift accumulation like any injury

**Social Response**:
- Varies by doctrine
- Some: Intervention and care
- Some: Punishment (wasting resources)
- Hollowed people sometimes harm former host body (disturbing)

---

### Forced Healing (Torture)

**The Horror**:
- Injure → Keelkin heals → Injure same spot → Repeat
- Creates massive scarring
- Accelerates drift
- Psychological trauma compounded by physical
- Can drive Hollowing (escape by losing self)

**Legal Status**:
- Illegal most places
- Happens anyway (interrogation, punishment, control)
- Underground fighting rings use this

**Medical Aftermath**:
- Repair debt enormous
- Tabs everywhere
- Chronic pain
- PTSD + physical horror

---

### Combat Healing (Active Fight)

**Keelkin in Combat**:
- Stabilize mode automatic
- Adrenaline + Keelkin = dangerous combination
- Pain blunted (can fight past normal limits)
- Bleeding controlled
- Can create false confidence → death

**The Risk**:
- Fighting through injuries you'd normally stop for
- Accumulating damage you don't feel
- Sudden collapse when adrenaline fades
- Massive repair debt afterward

**Tactical Implication**:
- Keelkin-bearers dangerous in melee (won't stop bleeding out)
- Must target brain/heart/spine for reliable kills
- Or: Poison, drowning, actinic exposure

---

## FAILURE MODES

### Misbuild (Construction Error)

**Cause**: Poor conditions, inadequate nutrients, stress, actinic exposure
**Result**: 
- Tissue built wrong (bone in muscle, nerve to wrong spot, vessel to nowhere)
- Functional disaster
- Requires surgical correction
- Sometimes irreversible

**Example**: 
- Finger rebuilt with bones fused
- Intestine healed with stricture
- Eye rebuilt but blind
- Nerve routed through scar (chronic pain)

---

### Rot-Seal (Sealed Infection)

**Cause**: Keelkin seals over contaminated wound
**Result**:
- Infection trapped inside
- Abscess forms
- Can go septic → death
- Requires cutting open the seal, draining, cleaning, re-sealing

**Prevention**: 
- Always clean wounds thoroughly
- Bleach baths after surface runs
- Writ-Doctor oversight for major injuries
- Don't let Keelkin seal dirty wounds

---

### Drift Cascade (Runaway Optimization)

**Cause**: Repeated injury + permissive Covenant + stress
**Result**:
- Keelkin optimizes without stopping
- Body transforms toward function
- Humanity erodes
- Approaching Hollowing

**Example**:
- Miner's hands become shovel-like
- Runner's legs become powerful but misshapen
- Fighter's body becomes armor-plated
- Awareness of self dims

---

### Repair Debt Collapse

**Cause**: Too many injuries too fast, inadequate nutrition, no rest
**Result**:
- Keelkin falls behind
- Seals start failing
- Old wounds reopen
- Fever
- Possible death or Hollowing

**Treatment**:
- Complete rest
- Maximum nutrition
- Writ-Doctor intervention
- Debt must be paid or host dies

## GAME MECHANICS TRANSLATION

If using Orrovae for tabletop RPG or narrative structure:

### Quick Healing Check

**Minor Injury**: Automatic success, 1-3 days, minimal receipt
**Moderate Injury**: Requires rest + nutrition, 1-2 weeks, visible receipt
**Major Injury**: Requires clinic + resources, 1-3 months, heavy receipt + drift
**Catastrophic**: Survival uncertain, 6+ months, permanent changes

### Failure Consequences

**Poor Conditions**: Quality drops one tier
**Malnutrition**: Time doubles, quality drops two tiers
**Actinic**: Misbuild risk, time triples
**Interrupted**: Start over, additional drift
**Infection**: Must stop, treat, restart

### Drift Tracking

Every major heal: +1 Drift
Every catastrophic heal: +3 Drift
At 10 Drift: Visible optimization
At 25 Drift: Recognizably different
At 50 Drift: Threshold risk (Hollowing warning)
At 75+ Drift: High Hollowing danger
