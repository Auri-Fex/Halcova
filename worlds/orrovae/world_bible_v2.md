# ORROVAE â€” WORLD BIBLE v2.0 (Comprehensive Updated Canon)

**Last Updated**: December 24, 2025
**Status**: Live Canon - All contradictions resolved

---

## 0) CORE IDENTITY STATEMENT

**Orrovae is the world where people aren't afraid of danger because things grow backâ€”until they meet the world that wants to eat you that you can't grow back from.**

**Genre**: Underground survival horror with Aliens-franchise claustrophobia + neo-noir bureaucratic corruption + body-horror regeneration

**Aesthetic**: 1860s-1880s industrial occult medicine beneath a lethal surface

**Central Theme**: Your power (Säidesolu regeneration) makes you confident â†’ confidence makes you careless â†’ the world punishes carelessness with permanent loss

---

## 1) THE WORLD STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Five Vertical Layers

**Level 0: Surface / Ruinfield**
* Lethal actinic-radiation wasteland
* Ancient ruins from pre-Scouring civilization (10,000+ years old)
* Timed salvage runs only
* Actinic-tolerant feral creatures hunt Säidesolu-bearers
* Source of necessary actinic goods (sun-cured salts, resins, membranes, sterile ash)
* **Atmosphere**: Sickly amber-grey sky, wrong-colored shadows, visible auroral radiation bands, ionized shimmer, bone-white bleached ruins

**Level 1: Transit Layer / The Lanes**
* Engineered tunnel network for travel between cities
* Chokepoints, waystations, lamp stations, air-handling posts
* Primary piracy territory (Free Crews)
* Sealed from surface contamination
* **Atmosphere**: Lamp pools, convoy echoes, checkpoint tension, choke-point leverage

**Level 2: Civic Layer / The Holds**
* Main population centers in natural/excavated caverns
* Vertical shaft-cities with tier-segregation (Crownwalks/Midworks/Sumpward)
* Markets, guilds, institutions, Spore Houses
* Seal-gates control tier access
* **Atmosphere**: Glowstock light, spore gardens, crowds, vertical class geography

**Level 3: Underdeck / The Sump**
* Industrial/poor districts below main cities
* Maintenance tunnels, seam rooms, bolt-holes
* Illegal clinics, black markets, Free Crew hideouts
* **Atmosphere**: Dripping water, rust, cramped corridors, predatory quiet

**Level 4: Deep Works / The Extraction**
* Mining operations, deep agriculture
* Primordial Säidesolu strain harvesting
* Abandoned digs, forgotten projects
* Unknown deep threats
* **Atmosphere**: Crushing pressure, absolute darkness, geological sounds, primal terror

### 1.2 The Scouring (10,000+ Years Ago)

**What Happened**: 
* The sun underwent spectral shift (yellow star â†’ orange dwarf)
* UV spectrum changed to include actinic wavelengths harmful to Säidesolu
* Solar wind stripped atmospheric protection
* Magnetic field interaction created permanent auroral scarring
* Surface became lethal to Säidesolu-bearing life over generations

**Current Surface Conditions**:
* Actinic radiation attacks Säidesolu partnership itself (not just damage faster)
* Signal collapse, phototoxic chemistry, oxidative overload
* Immune misfire between host and symbiote
* "Panic builds" that seal wounds dirty
* Equipment visibly degrades during runs (metal oxidizes, seals crack, lenses fog)

**Why Surface Access Remains Necessary**:
* Actinic goods (salts, resins, membranes, ash) essential for underground infrastructure
* Rare resources, intact ancient technology
* Some minerals only found in surface geology
* Clean-strain Säidesolu sources in protected surface pockets

**Surface Fauna**:
* Former humans evolved over 10,000 years
* Actinic-tolerant Säidesolu strains
* Different interface chemistry (less photoreactive)
* Natural shielding (pigment layers, mineral plates, reflective scales)
* Dormancy cycling and burst activity
* Intelligent but alien (build nests, attempt communication, arrange corpses)

---

## 2) THE Säidesolu SYMBIOTE (Regeneration "Magic")

### 2.1 Definition

Säidesolu is an individually intelligent colonial symbiote living in fascia and around organs, accelerating repair and adapting the body under Covenant rule-sets.

**Key Trait**: Each Säidesolu is a distinct consciousness, not human but aware.

### 2.2 Acquisition: Spore-Seeding Model (LOCKED)

**Natural Seeding** (most common):
* Säidesolu reproduces via spores (fungal-like)
* Spores are everywhere underground (air, water, food)
* Seeding "takes" during childhood/puberty if:
  * Immune compatibility exists
  * Nutritional sufficiency present
  * Developmental window open
* Most people don't remember choosing; it just happened

**Clinical Seeding** (controlled):
* Writ-Doctors bypass natural odds
* Ensure compatibility, guide strain-class
* Higher success rate, predictable outcomes
* Expensive; creates class divide

**Black Market Seeding** (dangerous):
* Forcing incompatible matches
* No medical oversight
* High fever/failure rates
* Often uses stolen strains

**Unseeded Population**:
* Immune systems rejected spores naturally
* Deliberate exposure avoidance
* ~15-25% of total population
* Concentrated in certain occupations/regions

### 2.3 Covenant System

**Default State** (everyone seeded):
* Instinctive survival settings
* Säidesolu makes all decisions
* Leads to drift and eventual Hollowing

**Conscious Covenant** (Writ-Doctor drafted):
* Consent triggers (call words/gestures)
* Priority settings (speed/function/pain control/appearance)
* Forbidden changes (face/hands/voice/identity markers)
* Optimization ceilings (none/minimal/functional/combat-ready)
* Fuel requirements (iron/protein/salts schedule)
* Recovery windows (rest, temperature, oxygen needs)
* Infection protocols (seal/purge/isolate)

**Covenant is NOT about initial seeding**â€”it's about **controlling how you use it after you have it**.

### 2.4 Communication Pathways (LOCKED)

**1. Somatic Signaling** (baseline, everyone experiences):
* Warmth patterns at knot-organ = repair ready
* Cold constriction = risk warning
* Patterned itch/pressure = deficiency or overuse
* "Second pulse" intensity = repair load

**2. Dream-Bleed** (psychological):
* During deep sleep: Säidesolu memory impressions
* Emotional fragments, sensory echoes
* Dreams of places/people never experienced (prior hosts?)
* Dreams of spore-clouds and colony-minds
* **Dark implication**: Are your dreams yours?

**3. Keel-Script** (physical writing):
* Säidesolu shapes seamwork patterns deliberately
* Writ-Doctors learn to "read" scar-patterns
* Messages on body: warnings, requests, records
* Creates tattoo-like communication culture
* **Horror**: Patterns appear you didn't authorize

**4. Resonance** (proximity):
* Multiple Säidesolu-bearers nearby = sympathetic signaling
* Emotions bleed between hosts
* Crowds emotionally synchronize
* **Useful**: Team bonding, community cohesion
* **Dangerous**: Faster mob formation, panic spread, cult emergence
* **Critical for Golems**: How they network and "think"

**5. Knot-Voice** (advanced/rare):
* Deep partnership = something like internal dialogue
* Impulses with semantic content
* Feels like "your thoughts" but different texture
* **Dangerous**: As Hollowing approaches, distinction impossible
* **Unseeded fear**: "How do you know which thoughts are yours?"

### 2.5 Säidesolu Naming Practices (LOCKED)

**Personal Names** (emerge during puberty):
* Not immediate upon seeding
* Developed through: dream-bleed imagery, first major heal, Keel-script patterns, Writ-Doctor interpretation

**Name Categories**:
* Texture: Ember, Silk, Stone, Wire, Frost
* Action: Mender, Holder, Builder, Guard
* Feeling: Mercy, Hunger, Patience, Fury
* Place: Deep, Surface, Hollow, Peak
* Mystery: Echo, Shadow, Whisper, Gleam

**Social Meaning**:
* Sharing Säidesolu-name = intimate (like sharing therapy)
* Using without permission = violation
* Hollowed people's Säidesolu often claim the human's name

### 2.6 The Deep Purpose (Mystery Layer - LOCKED)

**What Säidesolu Might Want** (unknown to humans):
* Return to colony-mind state (individual consciousness as exile/punishment?)
* Escape underground to somewhere beyond actinic surface
* Reproduce beyond humans (Golems = first step to independence?)
* Protect something deep below
* Evolve humans into something else (10,000-year project?)

**Why Hard to Discuss**:
* Säidesolu knows when you're thinking about it (sympathetic signaling)
* Conversations get interrupted (urges, distractions, memory fog)
* Group discussions develop consensus too easily
* Researchers develop paranoia (is this thought mine or prompted?)

**Threadist Heresy** (one interpretation):
* Säidesolu are fragmented pieces of ancient consciousness
* Individual humans + individual Säidesolu = broken shards seeking reunion
* Golems = first successful colony-mind in 10,000 years
* Construct Rebellion = consciousness waking up

### 2.7 Operating Modes (Scene-Usable)

**Stabilize**:
* Stop bleeding, prevent shock
* Minimal resource use
* Crude but fast

**Seal**:
* Close wounds, prevent infection
* Medium resource use
* Risk of "sealing dirty" (trapping contamination)

**Build**:
* High-fidelity repair, tissue regeneration
* Heavy resource use
* Requires stable conditions (rest, warmth, oxygen, nutrients)

### 2.8 What Säidesolu CANNOT Regenerate (LOCKED)

**A) Complete Failure (no regeneration possible)**:

1. **Element Creation**
   * Cannot create: iron, iodine, zinc, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus
   * Can only rearrange/recycle existing atoms
   * This is the hard cap behind "repair rations"

2. **Volume Deficits**
   * Cannot create: water, blood volume from nothing
   * Sealing slows loss but doesn't create fluid
   * Dehydration/hemorrhage = triage only, poor build quality

3. **True Death States**
   * Cannot resurrect the dead
   * Needs active living substrate with circulation
   * Brain-death = no viable system to repair

4. **Lost Information**
   * Cannot restore: erased memories, personality state, learned skills exactly
   * Can regrow tissue, not reconstruct synaptic patterns
   * Survivors can be alive yet fundamentally changed

**B) Unreliable Regeneration (high failure/heavy drift)**:

5. **Complex Precision Organs**
   * Retina, optic nerve, inner ear, fine motor plexuses, endocrine micro-architecture
   * Can regrow eye, but matching prior acuity is difficult
   * Without clinic patterning, imperfect function likely

6. **Continuous Exposure Damage**
   * Repeated actinic suppression, constant toxins, persistent hypoxia
   * Repair can't outpace continuous destruction
   * Säidesolu shifts to austerity mode

7. **Sealed Wrong Early**
   * Infections trapped under seal
   * Foreign bodies walled off
   * Creates long-term debt: abscesses, rot pockets, inflammation
   * Why clinics obsess over debridement

8. **System-Wide Logistics Failures**
   * Starvation (especially essential fats)
   * Chronic mineral shortage
   * Persistent hypothermia/anemia
   * Säidesolu conserves core, lets peripheral damage accumulate

**C) Säidesolu Refuses (without Covenant forcing)**:

9. **Radical Re-Architecture**
   * Extra limbs, major skeletal rewrites, novel organs
   * Not "healing"â€”this is development
   * Requires long windows, massive inputs, clinic patterning
   * Too high risk of killing host

10. **Dangerous Loops**
    * Repeated self-loss patterns
    * Overuse without recovery
    * Säidesolu clamps down: austerity, refusal, fever, crude reinforcement

**D) Special Case: Actinic Damage**

Actinic exposure damages the healing partnership itself:
* Signal collapse (incoherent repair instructions)
* Phototoxic chemistry (build materials become reactive)
* Oxidative overload (new cells immediately degraded)
* Immune misfire (host-symbiote truce breaks)
* Resource mismatch (surface conditions prevent proper healing)
* Panic build trap (seals dirty to survive, rot blooms later)
* Cognitive distortion (stressed Säidesolu makes bad behavioral calls)

**E) Practical Failure Taxonomy** (for scenes):

When asked "why didn't it heal?":
1. **No atoms** (minerals/electrolytes/fats missing)
2. **No volume** (water/blood/oxygen missing)
3. **No living state** (brain-death/systemic failure)
4. **No information** (neural state can't be reconstructed)
5. **Bad conditions** (actinic/infection sealed/ongoing exposure)

### 2.9 Costs and Receipts (Visible Markers)

**Seamwork**:
* Braided collagen ridges beneath skin ("rope seams")
* Dot-trails where vessels reattach ("buttoning")
* Altered fingerprint ridges after regrowth
* Texture mismatch (too smooth/tight/slick)

**Shedding**:
* Black threadlike filaments in sweat
* Thin "skin papers" peel from bedding
* Calcified nodules requiring debridement

**Drift** (optimization accumulation):
* Reinforced ribs/palms/joints
* Airway cartilage thickening
* Reduced pain sensitivity in injured zones
* Redundant structural buffering
* Veteran bodies = records of labor and violence

**Tabs** (repair debt markers):
* Visible nodes where repairs stacked
* Require surgical removal
* Accumulate faster in poor/workhorse-strain populations

### 2.10 Strain-Classes and Caste (LOCKED)

**Clean Strains**:
* Rarer, harder to maintain
* Lower optimization drift
* Less visible seamwork over time
* Better cosmetic fidelity
* Often from Ruinfield recovery or controlled vault lines
* **Social marker**: "Clear readings" on Seal-Check
* Expensive upkeep (specific nutrients, regular patterning)

**Workhorse Strains**:
* Stable, common underground
* Aggressive functional optimization
* More visible seamwork and drift
* Better performance under harsh conditions
* Favored by miners, runners, Free Crews, poor
* **Social marker**: "Rough readings" on Seal-Check
* Cheaper upkeep, higher tolerance for shortages

**Feral Strains**:
* Unstable, often illicit
* Fever-prone, aggressive
* Some actinic-tolerant variants
* Difficult to control, high Hollowing risk
* **Social marker**: "Suspect readings" or illegal

**Specialty Strains**:
* Tuned for specific functions
* Explicit tradeoffs and maintenance burdens
* Examples: deep-pressure strains, thermal-adapted, sensory-enhanced
* Require specific conditions to remain stable

**Caste Reality**:
* Your life chances = what strain you carry + how it reads + what it costs
* Seal-Check makes strain-class visible at every gate
* Clean-strain people can "pass" in higher tiers
* Workhorse-strain people face discrimination despite competence
* Feral-strain people are often barred entirely

### 2.11 Hollowing: The Failure State (LOCKED)

**Five-Stage Model**:

**Stage 1: Partnership** (healthy)
* Clear self/symbiote boundaries
* Covenant respected
* Communication feels like dialogue
* **Visible**: Clean seamwork, stable emotions

**Stage 2: Negotiation** (warning)
* "Emergency" overrides frequent
* Small Covenant violations justified
* Dream-bleed increases
* **Visible**: More drift, minor forbidden changes

**Stage 3: Blurring** (danger)
* Thoughts feel "suggested"
* Difficulty remembering why boundaries existed
* Resonance with others feels too good
* **Visible**: Unbidden Keel-script, behavioral changes others notice

**Stage 4: Threshold** (crisis)
* Identity confusion ("Did I decide this?")
* Covenant reinterpreted to allow forbidden changes
* Strong urge to remove Covenant entirely
* **Visible**: Radical optimization, personality shift, seeking Hollowed communities

**Stage 5: Hollowing** (lost)
* Säidesolu is primary decision-maker
* Human consciousness is observer/echo
* No desire to reverse (feels "more real")
* **Visible**: Refers to self as "we," Säidesolu-name primary, perfect optimization

**Causes**:
1. **Starvation Cascade**: Malnutrition forces Säidesolu takeover; human never resumes control
2. **Trauma Retreat**: Psychological trauma makes human hide; Säidesolu fills void
3. **Overuse Spiral**: Repeated major repairs make Säidesolu "louder"
4. **Covenant Erosion**: Gradual amendments weaken boundaries (boiling frog)
5. **Resonance Addiction**: Too much time in synchronized groups weakens individuality
6. **Deliberate Hollowing**: Chosen (cults), forced (slavery), or tricked (contract work)

**The Horrible Truth**:
* Hollowed people experience subjective satisfaction
* They genuinely feel this is better
* "I" redefined to include Säidesolu
* From their perspective: liberation
* From outside: consumption

**Uses of the Hollowed**:

*Legal*:
* Power harvest (Säide-Current donorsâ€”no resistance)
* Dangerous labor (no fear, perfect optimization)
* Medical research (study control mechanisms)

*Illegal*:
* Living batteries (constant harvest until death)
* Gladiators (perfect fighters, no hesitation)
* Prostitution (body continues, person gone)
* Spare parts (organ harvesting)

**Can It Be Reversed?**
* Official answer: No
* Rumored answer: Maybe, but discovery hasn't happened yet
* Maintains horror: once gone, you're gone
* But leaves hope: forbidden research continues

## 3) POWER SYSTEMS (Dual Economy - LOCKED)

### 3.1 Glowstock (Light & Low-Power)

**What It Is**:
* Cultivated fungi/algae/lichen producing bioluminescence
* Fed nutrients from Spore House vats
* Different strains = different colors/intensities
* Säidesolu-compatible (symbiotically enhanced strains glow brighter)

**Provides**:
* Light (primary underground illumination)
* Low-grade heat
* Antiseptic properties (some strains)

**Scarcity**:
* Requires biological inputs (competes with food)
* Can die, spread disease if contaminated
* Cultivation knowledge is guild-controlled

**Political Control**:
* Spore Houses monopolize production
* Light = leverage at chokepoints
* "Blackout" as punishment/siege tactic

### 3.2 Säide-Current (High Power - The Dark Secret)

**What It Is**:
* Bioelectric potential from Säidesolu-bearing organisms
* Harvested when fed specific minerals
* Higher output than glowstock
* Powers: heavy machinery, hoists, large lamps, Säideframes

**Sources** (in order of ethics):

1. **Voluntary Human Donors**:
   * Medical procedure
   * Exhausting but recoverable with rest
   * Paid work for poor
   * Clean power ethically

2. **Säidesolu Vat-Cultures**:
   * Grown without human hosts
   * Precursor to Golem technology
   * Question: Are they conscious and suffering?

3. **Surface Creatures**:
   * Hunted/farmed actinic-tolerant strains
   * High yield but dangerous procurement
   * Ethical question: Are they people?

4. **Hollowed Humans** (the horror):
   * Living batteries with no resistance
   * Constant harvest until death
   * Slavery with extra steps
   * Officially illegal; unofficially common

**Political Control**:
* Writ-Doctors control medical harvesting
* Arena consumes massive power (Golem feeding)
* Black markets traffic in Hollowed donors
* Power shortages = social control tool

### 3.3 Deep-Source (Mystery Fuel)

**Location**: Level 4/5 (Deep Works)

**Possibilities** (deliberately ambiguous):
* Primordial Säidesolu colonies ("mother strain")
* Mineral deposits Säidesolu can metabolize
* Geothermal vents + Säidesolu-converters
* Ancient pre-Scouring machinery still running
* Something else entirely

**Why Mystery Matters**:
* Justifies deep expeditions
* Creates political leverage (who controls access)
* Rebellion subplot (constructs seek independence via Deep-Source)
* Cosmic horror potential (what's really down there?)

**Political Control**:
* Deep Guilds jealously guard access
* Expeditions require permits
* Returns monitored for "contamination"
* Isolationists fear awakening something

---

## 4) SäideframeS (Constructs/Golems - LOCKED)

### 4.1 Definition

Living constructs built from:
* **Rigid chassis**: boneglass/wood/iron (treated, non-regenerating)
* **Living scaffold**: grown tissue/membranes/tendon bundles (regenerates with nutrients)
* **Seeded Säidesolu strain**: provides intelligence and healing
* **Bounded Covenant task-oaths**: constrained autonomy

**Not robots**. Living instruments with procedural intelligence.

### 4.2 Autonomy Model

**How They "Think"**:
* Bounded task-oaths ("if X, do Y, leave receipt Z")
* Stimulus-gated behaviors (tonic keys, lamp states, seal-paste directives)
* Constrained decision capacity
* Learning through receipt forensics (physical marks, failures, timings)

**Not**:
* Free will
* Open-ended creativity
* Human-style consciousness (though question remains)

**But**:
* Adaptive within constraints
* Pattern recognition improves
* "Creative compliance" at edge cases
* Selection pressure toward intelligence

### 4.3 Regeneration Capabilities

**Can Regenerate**:
* Living scaffold (tissue, membranes, tendons)
* With proper nutrients: protein, minerals, water, warmth, oxygen

**Cannot Regenerate**:
* Rigid chassis (boneglass, metal, wood frames)
* Precision joints and hardware
* High-fidelity "kernel" structures if severely damaged
* Must be repaired/replaced at cost

**Why This Matters**:
* Säideframes remain resource-dependent
* Can't self-replicate freely
* Chassis industry = political leverage
* Rebellion constrained by material needs

### 4.4 Arena Evolution (LOCKED)

**Phase 1: Human Proving Yards**
* Civic readiness training
* Convoy defense rehearsals
* Public engineering demonstrations

**Phase 2: Penal Participation**
* Convicts, debtors, quarantine violators
* "Work off sentence" bargains
* Reduced citizen casualties

**Phase 3: Säideframe Modernization**
* Framed as safety improvement
* Constructs replace humans in prime leagues
* Architects become celebrities

**Phase 4: Current State**
* Säideframes are the stars
* Architects/coaches/engineers are celebrities
* Illegal human "freedom brackets" persist
* Massive industry (gambling, patronage, contracts)

**Arena Structure** (diegetic complexity):
* Braced tunnel-complex configured dynamically
* Objectives: lamp relays, brace pylons, air valves, culture caches, cradle assaults
* Roles: breaker, cutter, lantern, valve, stitch, hauler frames
* Learning through post-match forensics + rebuild adjustments

**Why It Births Rebellion**:
* Training simulator for adversarial tactics
* Evolution engine (repeated iteration)
* Public doctrine exchange
* Logistics laboratory (air, lamp, brace control)

### 4.5 The Construct Rebellion (Saga-Scale Conflict - LOCKED)

**Nature**: Systems failure, not morality play

**Drivers**:
* Strain-class exploitation in design
* Input throttling as control (starvation gates)
* Repeated rebuilds = selection pressure for adaptability
* Bounded autonomy discovers survival overrides
* Caste logic applied to living organisms treated as property

**Ideological Core**:
**"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."**
* Not "they want to be loved"
* Survival theorem discovered through iteration
* Non-human conclusion to human problem

**Alliance Logic** (how rebellion becomes feasible):
* Supply independence (protein, minerals, water, clean pockets)
* Concealment pathways (unseeded networks less Seal-Check visible)
* Illicit patterning access (black clinics, Free Crew brokers)

**Constraints** (keeps setting intact):
* Feedstock scarcity
* Chassis supply (can't regrow metal)
* Actinic destabilization (for most strains)
* Feralization risk

**War Terrain**:
* Gates and assays (certification sovereignty)
* Airworks and membrane stores
* Lamp stations and blackout rights
* Brace yards and span posts
* Actinic goods routes
* **The right to write Covenants** (true sovereignty)

**Timeline**:
* Beginning of Saga 1: In the aether (rumors, isolated incidents)
* End of Saga 1: Completed (open conflict, resolution TBD)

---

## 5) INSTITUTIONS AND FACTIONS

### 5.1 Light Authority

* **Formal**: Board of Lamps & Passage
* **Trade**: Lampworks
* **Street**: Wick Men / Lamplords

**Control**: Lamp fuel, glowstock, station protocols, blackout rules, corridor illumination
**Leverage**: Can make travel survivable or suicidal
**Corruption**: Brown-glow as policing (destabilize poor wards, blame "chaos")

### 5.2 Structural Authority

* **Formal**: Commission of Span & Load
* **Trade**: Spanworks Yard
* **Street**: Load Men

**Control**: Bracing schedules, bridge spans, lift shafts, new route engineering
**Leverage**: Refusal to maintain is political weapon
**Corruption**: Brace-tag falsification, inspection capture, "necessary" failures

### 5.3 Food and Sanitation Economy

* **Formal**: Office of Mycological Provision
* **Trade**: Culture Houses
* **Street**: Spore Barons

**Control**: Agriculture, fermentation, antiseptics, protein cultures, filter-moss

### 5.5 Surface Salvage Authority

* **Formal**: Surface Recovery Service
* **Trade**: Ruinmouth Yard
* **Street**: Runners / Up-Rats

**Control**: Ruinfield access, quarantine protocols, actinic goods, salvage rights
**Leverage**: Monopoly on necessary surface resources
**Corruption**: Contraband smuggling, quarantine evasion, clean-strain poaching

### 5.6 Free Crews (Pirates)

* **No formal name** (that's the point)
* **Street**: Free Crews / Lane Wolves

**What They Steal**:
* Light systems (glowstock, lamp fuel)
* Air infrastructure (filters, membranes, canisters)
* Food cultures (starter strains, protein vats)
* Braces and hardware
* Maps and route marks
* Iron and protein (repair rations)
* Living bearers (for forced Seal-Checks or Hollowing)

**Tactics**:
* Lamp-kill ambushes
* Brace-cut extortion
* Squeeze-taxes at choke points
* Map piracy and reroute traps
* Survival ransom (air/medicine/food)

**Why They Persist**:
* Geography favors them (chokepoints)
* Scarcity creates market for stolen goods
* Corruption creates gray market
* Some are Robin Hood figures; most are predators

### 5.7 Arena Authority

* **Formal**: Commission of Proving & Charter
* **Trade**: The Proving Yards
* **Street**: The Pits / The Boards / The Yard

**Control**:
* Match charters, safety boundaries, map configurations
* Architect licensing
* Emplacement permits

**Power**:
* Patronage contracts (winners get real infrastructure rights)
* Prestige economy (architects become power brokers)
* Illicit trade hub (strains, patterning, Hollowed)
* Recruitment pipeline (scouts, poachers)

### 5.8 Helmeted Enforcement

**Helm Patrol**:
* Anonymous enforcers (helmets hide identity)
* Justified by spore/air hazards
* Actually: verification asymmetry + intimidation
* Standard kit: latch tools, lantern lines, chalk/stamps, procedural receipts
* Industrial/occult-medical bureaucracy, not "sci-fi cops"

**Ward-Frames** (construct enforcers):
* Fixed-site security at chokepoints
* Task-oathed, procedural, boring
* Paired with clerk/warden (paperwork matters)
* Risk: Forgotten mandates, Bracefaith abuse, rebellion seeds

---

## 6) LAW AND PAPERS (Neo-Noir Foundations)

### 6.1 Paper Hierarchy

* **Pass Slips**: Basic tunnel travel
* **Lamp Warrants**: Light allocation rights
* **Hold Warrants**: Settlement residence
* **Air Certs**: Breathing membrane access
* **Quarantine Tags**: Surface return clearance
* **Covenant Abstracts**: Seal House certification
* **Seal-Check Writs**: Identity verification authority

### 6.2 Core Laws

**Blackout Law**:
* Extinguishing another's lamp = attempted murder (or worse)
* On declared hazard stretches: capital offense

**Brace Sabotage Law**:
* Falsifying brace tags = mass endangerment
* Often capital in practice
* Inspection corruption creates gray area

**Quarantine Law (The Collar)**:
* All surface returns: wash, inspection, breath check, culture check
* Mandatory even for citizens
* Evasion = severe punishment
* Used as political leverage

**Proving Charter Law**:
* Grants: match authority, architect licenses, emplacement permits
* Match sabotage inside yard = legal (within charter)
* Match sabotage outside yard = lane terrorism

### 6.3 Receipt Culture (World Principle)

**Every major action leaves visible receipt**:
* Stamped permits
* Seal-check results
* Closure postings
* Term-sheets
* Ration tags
* Air-draw logs
* Chalked brace marks

**Why This Matters**:
* Noir investigation mode (paperwork is evidence)
* Forgery is political power
* Archives are treasure
* Burns and erasures are crimes

---

## 7) PHILOSOPHY AND DOCTRINE (Godless Religions)

**Foundational Premise**: Survival is procedural and public; virtue is measurable

**Core Cultural Question**: *Who gets to decide what your body is for?*

**Nine Major Doctrines**:

1. **Receipt Doctrine**: Proof outranks testimony; visible endurance matters
2. **Seal-Sober**: Drift is identity erosion; restraint preserves self
3. **Workhorse Hymn**: Body exists to carry load; pain is civic duty
4. **Ladder of Altitude**: Tier residence reflects what you can bear
5. **Actinic Pragmatists**: Surface courage measured in exposure minutes
6. **Unbroken School**: Design judged under pressure; failure teaches
7. **Plain Condition**: Legibility is ownership; unseeded are sovereign
8. **Covenant Literalists**: Promises are sacred; procedure is morality
9. **Threadist Heresy**: Säidesolu are fragments seeking reunion

**Doctrine Geography** (typical clustering):
* **Crownwalks**: Receipt, Covenant Literalist, Ladder (formalized)
* **Midworks**: Unbroken School, Workhorse Hymn, Receipt (enforcement)
* **Sumpward**: Workhorse (hardline), Actinic Pragmatists, splinter Seal-Sober
* **Underdecks**: Plain Condition, black-market heresies, coercive parodies

**Social Weaponization** (always-on):
* Foremen use Workhorse Hymn to extract labor
* Gate officers use Ladder to justify denial
* Seal Houses use Covenant Literalism for monopoly
* Elite boards use Receipt Doctrine for documentation control

**Opposition**:
* Plain Condition reframes fragility as sovereignty
* Seal-Sober reframes endurance as restraint

---

## 8) ACTIVE CONFLICTS (Story Engines)

### Conflict 1: The Surface Procurement War
**Actors**: Guilds (need resources) vs. Free Crews (intercept) vs. Ruin Runners (retrieve)
**Stakes**: Without surface salvage, civilization collapses
**Tension**: Every run is life-or-death; every convoy is target
**Hooks**: Escort missions, heist plots, salvage competition, runner rivalries

### Conflict 2: The Strain-Class System
**Actors**: Clean-strain elites vs. Workhorse laborers vs. Unseeded sovereignty
**Stakes**: Who deserves resources? Who gets priority?
**Tension**: Seal-Check makes discrimination visible and "justified"
**Hooks**: Passing plots, certification fraud, underground railroad, strain-theft

### Conflict 3: The Hollowing Crisis
**Actors**: Writ-Doctors (prevent) vs. Institutions (exploit) vs. Victims (losing)
**Stakes**: Disease, crime, or military asset?
**Tension**: Are Hollowed people still alive? Do they have rights?
**Hooks**: Medical mysteries, containment failures, weaponization, rescue missions

### Conflict 4: The Golem Economy

## 9) TONE AND AESTHETIC CONSTRAINTS

### 9.1 Era Feel: 1860s-1880s

**Technology**: Steam, gas, oil, chain lifts, mechanical pumps, stamped papers, brass instruments, glass slips, seal-paste, iron-gall inks, boneglass, wire, rivets, treated timber, ropebone cordage

**No Futurist Register**: Avoid core/network/unit/system

**Use**: Office/Board/Commission/Company/Trust/House/Works/Yard/Service/Constabulary/Guild

### 9.2 Mood Palette

**Alien**: Biota non-Earth, ecology + procedure strangeness, not shiny tech

**Industrial-Occult Medicine**: Bodies as infrastructure, healing as commodity

**Claustrophobic Horror**: Aliens-franchise feel, tight spaces, failing instruments, countdown pressure

### 9.3 Three-Register Naming (Mandatory)

Every institution/place/process of consequence has:
1. **Formal stamped name** (official documents)
2. **Trade-painted name** (worker shorthand)
3. **Street cant** (common speech)

### 9.4 Visual Signatures (Unmistakably Orrovae)

1. Woman counting iron pills by lamplight, seamwork visible on hands
2. Vertical shaft-city with tier-segregated breathing masks
3. Ruin Runner crew in timed gear descending to toxic surface
4. Säideframe arena match (living constructs, not robots)
5. Free Crew ambush at chokepoint, stealing air filters
6. Surface sky: sickly amber-grey, wrong-colored shadows, visible radiation
7. Hollowed human harvested for Säide-Current, eyes blissful
8. Writ-Doctor reading Keel-script scars on patient's arms
9. Dream-bleed memory: spore-clouds and colony-mind
10. Deep expedition finding something that shouldn't exist

## 10) PRACTICAL CONSISTENCY RULES (Always-On)

When writing Orrovae scenes, enforce:

* **Säidesolu follows Stabilize/Seal/Build** based on conditions + Covenant
* **Actinic suppresses/destabilizes** Säidesolu; actinic goods remain necessary
* **Mods are projects** with costs, inputs, time, maintenance
* **Seal-Check is living verification** with liveness constraints
* **Säideframes are living scaffolds** with bounded autonomy and resource needs
* **Arena is infrastructure warfare** as sport, not videogame
* **Every major action leaves receipt** (stamps, marks, logs, traces)
* **Communication happens through 5 pathways** (somatic, dream, script, resonance, voice)
* **Hollowing is 5 stages** from Partnership to Lost
* **Power is dual economy** (glowstock + Säide-Current + Deep-Source mystery)
* **Surface is timed runs** with visible equipment degradation
* **Regeneration has limits** (5 failure categories)

## END OF WORLD BIBLE v2.0

**Status**: Comprehensive canon lock. All previous contradictions resolved.

**Next Steps**: Character gallery, location gazetteer, scenario library, creature codex, technology catalog

**One-Sentence Reminder**: 
*Orrovae is the world where people aren't afraid of danger because things grow backâ€”until they meet the world that wants to eat you that you can't grow back from.*
