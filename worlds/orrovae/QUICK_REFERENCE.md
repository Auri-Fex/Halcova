# ORROVAE QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

**For rapid lookup during writing/gaming/storytelling**

---

## THEMATIC SPINE

**Axis 1 â€” Power/Cost**: *"Every miracle has a supply chain. Every body keeps a ledger."*
**Axis 2 â€” Rebellion/Empire**: *"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."*
**Central Question**: Who decides what your body is for?

---

## CORE IDENTITY

**One-Sentence**: People aren't afraid of danger because things grow backâ€”until they meet the world that wants to eat you that you can't grow back from.

**Genre**: Underground survival horror + neo-noir corruption + body horror regeneration

**Tone**: Aliens-franchise claustrophobia + 1860s industrial occult medicine

---

## THE FIVE-SECOND PITCH

Civilization lives in underground tunnels beneath a toxic surface. Everyone has a symbiotic partner (Säidesolu) that heals themâ€”but healing changes you. Your body becomes a record of every injury. Some people hollow out entirely, their symbiote taking over. Living constructs (Golems) are starting to think for themselves. The surface wants to eat you, and you can't grow back from that.

---

## FIVE LAYERS (Vertical World)

0. **Surface/Ruinfield**: Toxic, timed salvage runs, feral creatures, actinic radiation, bone-white ruins
1. **Lanes**: Travel tunnels, chokepoints, waystations, pirate territory
2. **Holds**: Main cities, vertical tiers, markets, most people live here
3. **Sump**: Industrial poor districts, illegal clinics, black markets
4. **Deep Works**: Mining, deep agriculture, unknown threats, mystery fuel

---

## Säidesolu BASICS (The "Magic")

**What**: Intelligent symbiote, lives in fascia/organs, accelerates repair
**How Acquired**: Spore seeding (natural/clinical/black market), ~75-85% have it
**Control**: Covenant (consent triggers, priorities, forbidden changes, fuel needs)
**Cost**: Seamwork, shedding, drift, tabs (visible body changes)
**Limit**: Cannot create elements, cannot resurrect, brain state not guaranteed
**Failure**: Hollowing (symbiote takes over in 5 stages)

**Communication** (5 ways):
1. Somatic (warmth, pressure, pulse)
2. Dream-Bleed (sleep memories)
3. Keel-Script (scar patterns)
4. Resonance (proximity emotions)
5. Knot-Voice (rare internal dialogue)

---

## WHAT Säidesolu CAN'T FIX (The Stakes)

1. **No atoms**: Can't create iron, minerals, electrolytes
2. **No volume**: Can't create water/blood from nothing
3. **No resurrection**: Dead is dead (brain death irreversible)
4. **No information**: Can't restore exact memories/personality
5. **Actinic damage**: Attacks the partnership itself, not just the body

**In-world phrase**: "It can't grow you back from that"

---

## STRAIN-CLASSES (The Caste System)

**Clean**: Low drift, expensive, elite marker, "clear readings"
**Workhorse**: High drift, common, poor marker, "rough readings"
**Feral**: Unstable, dangerous, some actinic-tolerant, "suspect readings"
**Specialty**: Function-specific, explicit tradeoffs

**Visible via**: Seal-Check (living identity verification)

---

## HOLLOWING (The Horror)

**5 Stages**: Partnership â†’ Negotiation â†’ Blurring â†’ Threshold â†’ Lost

**What it is**: Säidesolu becomes primary consciousness; human becomes passenger

**The twist**: Hollowed people feel satisfied (liberation to them, consumption to others)

**Causes**: Starvation, trauma, overuse, erosion, addiction, deliberate

**Uses**: Power harvest, labor, research (legal); batteries, gladiators, organs (illegal)

---

## POWER SYSTEMS

**Glowstock**: Bioluminescent cultures (light + low power)
**Säide-Current**: Bioelectric from Säidesolu organisms (high power, ethical questions)
**Deep-Source**: Mystery fuel from Level 4/5

**Political control**: Spore Houses (glowstock), Writ-Doctors (Säide-Current), Deep Guilds (mystery)

---

## SäideframeS (Golems)

**What**: Rigid chassis + living scaffold + Säidesolu + task-oaths
**Intelligence**: Procedural, learns through experience, bounded autonomy
**Arena**: Evolved from human proving yards â†’ celebrity sport (architects are stars)
**Rebellion**: Systems failure drives constructs toward independence (Saga conflict)

---

## THE SURFACE

**What happened**: 10,000+ years ago, sun shifted spectrum, actinic radiation made surface lethal to Säidesolu

**Current state**: Amber-grey sky, wrong shadows, visible radiation, bone-white ruins, equipment degrades visibly

**Creatures**: Evolved former humans, actinic-tolerant Säidesolu, intelligent but alien

**Why go**: Actinic goods essential (salts, resins, membranes, ash), rare resources, ancient tech

**Time limit**: Runs are timed, exposure accumulates, "panic builds" seal dirty

---

## INSTITUTIONS (Three-Register Names)

**Light**: Board of Lamps / Lampworks / Wick Men
**Structure**: Commission of Span & Load / Spanworks / Load Men
**Food**: Office of Mycological Provision / Culture Houses / Spore Barons
**Medicine**: Covenant Office / Seal Houses / Knot Docs
**Surface**: Surface Recovery Service / Ruinmouth Yard / Runners
**Pirates**: No formal name / Free Crews / Lane Wolves
**Arena**: Commission of Proving / Proving Yards / The Pits
**Enforcers**: No formal name / Helm Patrol / Helms

---

## CORE LAWS

**Blackout**: Extinguishing lamps = murder
**Brace Sabotage**: Falsifying tags = mass endangerment
**Quarantine**: Surface returns = mandatory wash/inspection
**Proving Charter**: Match legal inside yard, terrorism outside

---

## NINE DOCTRINES (Godless Religions)

1. **Receipt**: Proof outranks testimony
2. **Seal-Sober**: Drift erodes identity
3. **Workhorse Hymn**: Body carries load
4. **Ladder**: Tier reflects endurance
5. **Actinic**: Courage in exposure
6. **Unbroken**: Design under pressure
7. **Plain Condition**: Unseeded sovereignty
8. **Covenant Literalist**: Promises sacred
9. **Threadist**: Säidesolu fragments reuniting

**Core question**: "Who decides what your body is for?"

---

## ACTIVE CONFLICTS (Story Hooks)

1. **Surface War**: Salvage necessity vs. piracy vs. runner danger
2. **Strain-Class**: Elite vs. labor vs. unseeded over resources/rights
3. **Hollowing**: Disease vs. exploitation vs. weaponization
4. **Golem Economy**: Tools vs. slaves vs. citizens
5. **Deep Expeditions**: Resources vs. risk vs. unknown

**Thematic Framing**: Every conflict expresses Power/Cost (what is spent, who profits) and Rebellion/Empire (who controls, who breaks free).

---

## WRITING CONSISTENCY CHECKS

**When writing scenes, verify**:

âœ“ Säidesolu follows Stabilize/Seal/Build (based on conditions + Covenant)
âœ“ Actinic suppresses Säidesolu (surface runs timed, equipment degrades)
âœ“ Every major action leaves receipt (stamps, marks, logs)
âœ“ Communication uses 5 pathways (somatic, dream, script, resonance, voice)
âœ“ Hollowing shows stages (not instant)
âœ“ Power costs resources (glowstock/Säide-Current/Deep-Source)
âœ“ Regeneration has limits (5 failure categories)
âœ“ Strain-class visible (Seal-Check makes it readable)
âœ“ Geography matters (5 layers with different rules)
âœ“ Era is 1860s-1880s (steam, gas, brass, no futurist terms)

---
