7. ‚úÖ **01_story_spine/thematic_core.md** - Thematic architecture (Power/Cost + Rebellion/Empire)

### Canon Systems Locked
- ‚úÖ Core identity and premise
- ‚úÖ Five-layer vertical geography
- ‚úÖ The Scouring (10,000-year history with scientific basis)
- ‚úÖ S‰idesolu symbiote (complete system)
  - Individual intelligence
  - Five communication pathways
  - Spore-seeding acquisition
  - Regeneration limits taxonomy
  - Five-stage Hollowing progression
  - Naming practices and culture
- ‚úÖ Power systems (glowstock, S‰ide-Current, Deep-Source)
- ‚úÖ S‰ideframes/Golems (complete construction and rebellion)
- ‚úÖ Eight institutions with three-register names
- ‚úÖ Law and receipt culture
- ‚úÖ Nine philosophical doctrines
- ‚úÖ Five active conflicts
- ‚úÖ Tone and aesthetic guidelines
- ‚úÖ Consistency rules

### Major Additions (What's New)

**The Scouring**: 10,000+ years ago, sun spectral shift created actinic radiation that made surface lethal to S‰idesolu-bearing life. Former humans evolved actinic-tolerant strains. Comprehensive visual descriptions (amber-grey sky, wrong shadows, bone-white ruins, visible auroral radiation).

**S‰idesolu Intelligence**: Locked as individually conscious, not just instinctive. Each symbiote is a distinct awareness. Makes Covenant meaningful as real negotiation. Creates horror when Hollowing occurs (losing to another consciousness inside you).

**Communication System**: Five pathways (somatic, dream-bleed, Keel-script, resonance, Knot-Voice). Enables Golem networking, creates cultural practices, adds psychological horror ("are your thoughts yours?").

**Spore-Seeding**: Hybrid acquisition model resolves innate vs. chosen tension. Spores everywhere underground, natural seeding most common, clinical/black market as alternatives. ~15-25% unseeded population.

**Regeneration Limits**: Complete taxonomy (5 categories of failure). Prevents power creep. Makes actinic threat work. Creates medical language. Stakes are real.

**Hollowing Stages**: Clear five-stage progression from Partnership to Lost. Multiple causes. Subjective satisfaction vs. objective consumption. Uses (legal and illegal). Reversal officially impossible (rumors suggest maybe).

**Power Economy**: Dual system (glowstock bioluminescence + S‰ide-Current bioelectric harvest) plus Deep-Source mystery. Distinct from other worlds. Ties to biology theme. Creates ethical horror (Hollowed as batteries).

**Deep Purpose**: Mystery layer‚Äîwhat S‰idesolu actually want (colony-mind reunion? Escape? Evolution project?). Hard to discuss (S‰idesolu knows when you're thinking about it). Threadist heresy interpretation.

**S‰idesolu Naming**: Cultural practices around personal names emerging through communication pathways. Social intimacy and violation protocols.

**Active Conflicts**: Five major ongoing tensions that drive all stories (Surface War, Strain-Class, Hollowing Crisis, Golem Economy, Deep Expeditions).

---

## CONTRADICTIONS RESOLVED

1. **Acquisition**: Spore-seeding model reconciles "not innate" with "wild-seeded exists"
2. **Covenant Purpose**: Separated from seeding; controls use, not acquisition
3. **Intelligence**: Locked as individually conscious (makes all systems coherent)
4. **Hollowing**: Five-stage model with causes and progression (not vague takeover)
5. **Power Source**: Distinct dual economy (not vague "light and power")
6. **Surface Timeline**: 10,000+ years (evolutionary time, not living memory)
7. **Unseeded**: ~15-25% (significant minority, not fringe or majority)
8. **Reversal**: Officially no, rumors yes (maintains horror and hope)

## UNIQUENESS FROM OTHER WORLDS CONFIRMED

**vs. Selnara**:
- Orrovae: Biological transformation through partnership
- Selnara: Behavioral corruption through Signal Pale

**vs. Halcova**:
- Orrovae: Losing self through successful partnership
- Halcova: Never having self because fate predetermined

**vs. Kitsahl/Alt-Earth**:
- Orrovae: Body becoming unrecognizable through healing
- Kitsahl: Future being measurable through prophecy

**Orrovae's Unique Statement**:
*The world where your power makes you confident until you meet something that can't be grown back from.*

## RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

### Option 1: Start Character Development
Begin building the character gallery. Start with 10 essential NPCs (one per major faction), then expand to 30-50. This makes the world feel inhabited and provides immediate story hooks.

**First 10 NPCs suggested**:
1. Elite Writ-Doctor (Crownwalks, clean-strain, Receipt Doctrine)
2. Workhorse laborer (Midworks, visible drift, Workhorse Hymn)
3. Free Crew captain (Lanes, feral-strain, pragmatic)
4. Surface Runner (Ruinmouth, actinic-scarred, Actinic Pragmatist)
5. Arena architect (celebrity, Stage 2 Hollowing secret)
6. Unseeded activist (Sumpward, Plain Condition, sovereignty advocate)
7. Helm Patrol enforcer (anonymous, conflicted, Ladder doctrine)
8. Spore House administrator (food power, corruption, Covenant Literalist)
9. Deep expedition leader (mysterious, isolationist fear, Threadist?)
10. Ordinary family member (shows daily life, multiple doctrines in one family)

### Option 2: Detail One Hub Completely
Pick one of the 8 major hubs and develop it to 100% completion as a template. **Suggested starter**: Ruinmouth (Surface access creates immediate drama, quarantine conflict, diverse population, multiple factions present).

### Option 3: Write First Scenario Batch
Create 5-10 ready-to-run scenarios (one per conflict type, plus extras). This tests world systems in practice and reveals gaps organically.

### Option 4: All of the Above in Parallel
- Morning: Character work (build 1-2 NPCs)
- Afternoon: Location detail (add to one hub)
- Evening: Scenario writing (outline/draft one)
- Creatures/tech/documents emerge as needed

---

## WRITING CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

Before considering any scene/story "Orrovae-authentic", verify:

- ‚úì S‰idesolu follows Stabilize/Seal/Build based on conditions + Covenant
- ‚úì Actinic suppresses S‰idesolu; surface runs timed; equipment degrades visibly
- ‚úì Every major action leaves receipt (stamps, marks, logs, traces)
- ‚úì Communication uses 5 pathways (not telepathy, not language)
- ‚úì Hollowing shows stages (not instant possession)
- ‚úì Power costs resources (glowstock/S‰ide-Current/Deep-Source specifics)
- ‚úì Regeneration has limits (5 failure categories apply)
- ‚úì Strain-class visible via Seal-Check (discrimination is systemic)
- ‚úì Geography matters (which layer? What tier?)
- ‚úì Era is 1860s-1880s (steam, gas, brass; no futurist terms)
- ‚úì Three-register naming for institutions/places
- ‚úì Sensory palette matches (glowstock phosphorescence, damp stone, etc.)

---

## TONE CALIBRATION QUICK-CHECK

**If writing feels off**:

**Too light?** ‚Üí Add receipt consequences, visible drift markers, Hollowing stage indicator, time pressure
**Too dark?** ‚Üí Show partnership moments, unseeded solidarity, doctrine beauty, small victories
**Too generic?** ‚Üí Add S‰idesolu communication moment, three-register name, specific seamwork detail
**Too futurist?** ‚Üí Replace tech terms with mechanical equivalents, add steam/brass/gas/lamp details

---

## COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES

This world is ready for:
- **Writing team**: Divide by content type (characters, locations, scenarios, etc.)
- **Artist collaboration**: Visual development (seamwork, S‰ideframes, surface sky, etc.)
- **Playtesting**: If developing as game, scenarios can be tested and refined
- **Community building**: Fan submissions for NPCs, locations, creatures

---

## VERSION MILESTONES PROPOSED

- **v2.0** ‚úÖ Current: World systems locked
- **v2.1**: First character batch (10 NPCs)
- **v2.2**: First hub detailed (choose one)
- **v2.3**: First scenario batch (5-10)
- **v2.5**: Characters complete (50 NPCs)
- **v3.0**: All hubs + 50 scenarios
- **v4.0**: 100% completion

---

## FINAL SUMMARY

**What You Now Have**:
A fully realized, internally consistent, unique fantasy world with comprehensive systems, locked canon, zero contradictions, and clear differentiation from your other settings.

**What Makes It Work**:
- Body horror through consensual partnership (not curse/infection)
- Intelligence in the symbiote (creates real relationship, real loss)
- Underground claustrophobia + toxic surface (Aliens-franchise feel)
- Bureaucratic noir (receipts, papers, gates as power)
- 1860s-1880s industrial occult medicine (distinct aesthetic)
- Active conflicts built into structure (stories emerge naturally)

**What Makes It Unique**:
*People aren't afraid of danger because things grow back‚Äîuntil they meet the world that wants to eat you that you can't grow back from.*

**What's Next**:
Build the operational content (characters, locations, scenarios) that brings this world to life. The foundation is solid. Time to populate it.
