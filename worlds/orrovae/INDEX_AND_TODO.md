## ESTIMATED WORK TO 100% COMPLETION

### Word Count Targets
- **Completed**: ~30,000 words (world systems)
- **Characters**: ~25,000 words (50 NPCs Ã— 500 words each)
- **Locations**: ~40,000 words (8 hubs Ã— 3,000 + 50 minor Ã— 400)
- **Scenarios**: ~25,000 words (50 scenarios Ã— 500 words each)
- **Creatures**: ~15,000 words (30 creatures Ã— 500 words each)
- **Technology**: ~15,000 words (75 items Ã— 200 words each)
- **Documents**: ~15,000 words (75 documents Ã— 200 words each)
- **Tables**: ~10,000 words (6 comprehensive tables)
- **Guides**: ~10,000 words (4 guides)

**Total Estimated**: ~185,000 words total (155,000 additional)

### Time Estimates (If Working Solo)
- Characters: 2-3 weeks
- Locations: 3-4 weeks
- Scenarios: 2-3 weeks
- Creatures: 1-2 weeks
- Technology: 1-2 weeks
- Documents: 1-2 weeks
- Tables: 1 week

**Total**: ~12-17 weeks of dedicated work

### Collaboration Opportunities
- **Writing Team**: Divide by category (someone owns characters, someone locations, etc.)
- **Artist Collaboration**: Visual development parallel to text
- **Playtesting**: Scenarios tested and refined iteratively
- **Community Input**: Creature/location/NPC submissions

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**If starting development now, recommended order**:

1. **Character Gallery** (Priority 1)
   - Start with 10 essential NPCs (one per faction)
   - Expand to 30, then 50
   - Build relationship map as you go

2. **Location Gazetteer** (Priority 2)
   - Detail the 8 major hubs first
   - Add 20 waystations/chokepoints
   - Fill in 30 minor locations

3. **Scenario Library** (Priority 3)
   - Write 10 scenarios (2 per conflict type)
   - Test/refine
   - Expand to 50

4. **Everything Else** (Priorities 4-8)
   - Develop in parallel as needed
   - Tables can be built while writing scenarios
   - Documents emerge from scenarios naturally

---

## MAINTENANCE PLAN

**As world develops**:
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each addition
- Cross-reference new content in QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Ensure consistency with world_bible_v2.md
- Build index of NPCs, locations, creatures as created
- Maintain version control

**Version milestones**:
- v2.1: First character batch (10 NPCs)
- v2.2: First hub detailed (pick one)
- v2.3: First scenario batch (5-10)
- v2.5: Characters complete (50 NPCs)
- v3.0: All major hubs detailed + 50 scenarios
- v4.0: 100% completion target

---

**END OF INDEX & TODO**

**Current Status**: World systems locked and comprehensive. Ready to begin operational content development.

**Next Action**: Choose Priority 1 (Characters), Priority 2 (Locations), or Priority 3 (Scenarios) and begin building.
