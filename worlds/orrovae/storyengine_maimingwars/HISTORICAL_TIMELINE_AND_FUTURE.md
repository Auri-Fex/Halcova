# ORROVAE: HISTORICAL TIMELINE AND SAGA CONTEXT
## Series Structure, Pre-History, and Post-Saga World State

**Last Updated**: January 4, 2026

---

# PART ONE: SERIES VS. BOOK PROLOGUES

## The Question

Should each book have:
1. A **Series Prologue** (orienting readers to the saga as a whole), AND
2. A **Book Prologue** (specific to that book's arc)?

## Recommendation: Yes, But Distinct Functions

### Series Prologue (Brief Epigraph/Orientation)
**Purpose**: Orient readers who pick up any book in the series
**Length**: ~200-400 words maximum
**Format**: Could be:
- An in-universe document excerpt
- A fragment of poetry/prophecy
- A consistent framing device
- A "The Story So Far" for Books 2-5

### Book Prologue (Narrative Scene)
**Purpose**: Establish that specific book's themes, plant dramatic irony
**Length**: ~1,000-1,500 words
**Format**: Full prose scene from unique perspective

## Proposed Implementation

### Series Epigraph (Same for All Books)

> *From the Sealed Records, recovered Year 5 of Reunification:*
>
> "We told them the gates would reopen when it was safe. We lied. We sealed the gates and erased them from history. Ten thousand years later, our descendants have forgotten the debt. But the surface remembers.
>
> This is the account of the Maiming Warsâ€”the five years when we tore ourselves apart over doctrine while our forgotten kin returned to claim their home. Eight witnesses. One survivor. The count is 273.
>
> Remember them."
>
> â€” *Kaisa Kalevin, Translator, First Reunification Archive*

**Placement**: After title page, before any other material
**Function**: Tells readers this is a tragedy with one survivor; establishes the series scope

---

### Book-Specific "Previously" Sections (Books 2-5)

For Books 2-5, include a brief "THE STORY SO FAR" section after the Series Epigraph but before the Book Prologue:

**Book 2**: ~300 words covering Book 1's key events and Helmar's death
**Book 3**: ~400 words covering Books 1-2, Torven's death, war escalation
**Book 4**: ~500 words covering Books 1-3, Sigurd and Grigor's deaths, construct rebellion
**Book 5**: ~600 words covering Books 1-4, all deaths so far, current state

**Format**: Written in-universe as archive summaries by Aino (revealed in Book 5 epilogue as the source)

---

### Book Prologues (As Previously Designed)

| Book | Series Epigraph | Story So Far | Book Prologue |
|------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Yes (full) | No | "Ten Thousand Years Ago" |
| 2 | Yes (full) | Yes (~300w) | "Six Months of War" |
| 3 | Yes (full) | Yes (~400w) | "Grigor's Coming Death" |
| 4 | Yes (full) | Yes (~500w) | "The Doctrine Defender" |
| 5 | Yes (full) | Yes (~600w) | "The Sealed Memory" |

This structure allows:
- New readers to start at any book and understand context
- Returning readers to skip "Story So Far" if preferred
- Each book to function as entry point to the series
- Unified framing across all five volumes

---

# PART TWO: COMPLETE HISTORICAL TIMELINE

## Era Naming Convention

Orrovae uses two calendar systems:
1. **Year of Sealing (YS)**: Counted from the closure of the gates (Year 0)
2. **Year of Reunification (YR)**: Post-saga dating (begins end of Book 5)

The Maiming Wars occur in **YS 9,847-9,852** (roughly 10,000 years after the Sealing)

---

## DEEP HISTORY: Before the Sealing

### The Surface Era (Unknown Duration â†’ YS 0)

**The Symbiote Discovery** (~1,500 years before Sealing)
- Humanity discovers SÃ¤idesolu in deep cave systems
- Initially used by miners and explorers for survival
- Gradual integration into medicine, then society
- First "Covenant" frameworks developed to guide symbiote behavior

**The Expansion Period** (~1,000-500 years before Sealing)
- Surface civilization spreads across continent
- Symbiote technology enables dangerous environments
- Class divisions emerge: Clean-strain (medical/elite), Workhorse (industrial), Feral (uncontrolled)
- Underground infrastructure expands as mining/storage/military

**The Dimming** (~500-200 years before Sealing)
- Solar output changes (not specified as natural or artificial)
- Surface becomes increasingly hostile
- Actinic radiation intensifiesâ€”suppresses symbiote function
- "Surface sickness" emerges: symbiotes fail under exposure
- Underground expansion accelerates as refuge

**The Scouring** (~200-50 years before Sealing)
- Surface becomes lethal for extended habitation
- Mass migration underground begins
- Not everyone can go: limited space, limited resources
- Rationing of underground access begins
- First "who deserves survival" debates

**The Final Descent** (~50 years before Sealing â†’ Year 0)
- Surface population: millions
- Underground capacity: hundreds of thousands
- Selection process implemented: wealth, utility, connections
- Those left behind promised: "When it's safe, we'll return"
- The promise was a lie from the beginning

### The Sealing (Year 0)

**The Closure**
- Gates sealed permanently
- Records of surface population erased over following centuries
- "The surface was never ours" becomes official history

# PART THREE: POST-SAGA STORY POTENTIAL

## The World State Post-Reunification

- Underground purists who'd rather burn than share
- Surface factions who want revenge, not reunion
- A thriller about the first post-war terrorist attack

**3. "THE CONSTRUCT QUESTION"**
- Legal personhood doesn't mean acceptance

**Premise**: A young person from the surface community is being trained by Kaisa. But someone is killing translators, and the student discovers the assassin is from their own communityâ€”someone who doesn't want peace.
**Themes**: Betrayal, identity, the cost of being a bridge

### "THRESHOLD" (YR 15-20)
**Genre**: Neo-noir western
**Premise**: A settlement at Gate 17 (site of major battle) has become a lawless trading post. A construct sheriff tries to keep order. When a prominent Underground citizen is murdered, all the old hatreds resurface.

### "INHERITANCE TAX" (YR 5-7)
**Genre**: Legal thriller
**Premise**: Aino prosecutes war criminals using the archive. But she discovers evidence that would implicate people now essential to integrationâ€”including Kaisa's grandmother. Does justice require destroying peace?
**Themes**: Truth vs. reconciliation, the weight of documentation

### "THE LONG RETURN" (YR 40-50)
**Genre**: Multi-generational epic
**Premise**: Three generations of a family navigating reunification: the grandmother who fought in the wars, the parent who grew up in the transition, the grandchild who's never known division. When a crisis threatens to restart conflict, all three must act.

*"We told them the gates would reopen. Ten thousand years later, they did. Not because we opened themâ€”because they came back and demanded to be let in. That's the truth we're still learning to live with."*
â€” First Reunification Archive
