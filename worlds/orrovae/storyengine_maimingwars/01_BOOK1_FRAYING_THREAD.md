## BOOK SUMMARY

The Maiming Wars begin with a single assassination. When a prominent political figure is killed via induced Hollowing—the first documented weaponization of the symbiotic bond—the underground society of Korrgate fractures along doctrinal lines. Five lives become entangled in the aftermath: a mercenary hired to protect the next target, a Säide-Writ student who witnesses the corpse, a surface Runner who discovers intelligence in the creatures above, an Unseeded leader navigating his community through crisis, and a bureaucrat who files the documents that will ignite a war—and his own death warrant.

---

## THEMATIC FOCUS

**Axis 1 — Power/Cost**: Does regeneration make violence cheaper, or more expensive?
- **Answer**: More expensive—it makes violence more creative, more personal, more horrifying
- **Expression**: Weaponized Hollowing is the first ledger-breaking cost. Every faction will pay.

**Axis 2 — Rebellion/Empire**: The conspiracy requires complicit institutions.
- **Expression**: Helmar signs the death certificates. The empire's paperwork is its murder weapon.
- **Complication**: The doctrine that should restrain violence instead justifies it.

**Central Question (Book 1)**: Who decides what your body is for—and what happens when someone decides you don't get to decide?

# PART 1: SETUP

- **Location**: Aldric's residence, Crownwalk
- **Time**: Morning
- **Summary**: Sigurd and Torven reach Aldric's home. He's in Stage 4 Hollowing—induced, accelerated. He has minutes of clarity left. He tries to tell Sigurd something important about "lineage, inheritance, what the Säide carries forward." Then he's gone. The Hollowed thing that remains doesn't recognize him.
- **Stakes**: Mentor's warning silenced; key information lost
- **Content**: H5 (Hollowing horror), P5 (grief), G3 (physical degradation)
- **Seeds Planted**: B1-S023 (incomplete warning → B3 when Sigurd Hollows)
- **Relationships**: R003 ends (Sigurd/Aldric)

**B1.P4.C1.S2** — "The Mercy"
- **Location**: Same
- **Time**: Moments later
- **Summary**: Torven offers. Sigurd refuses—He'll do it herself. He administers the mercy protocol. The Hollowed Aldric thanks her; the words are wrong, spoken by something else. He vomits after.
- **Stakes**: Sigurd performs euthanasia; traumatic growth
- **Content**: V4 (mercy killing), P5 (moral injury), D5 (the gratitude)
- **Dark Humor**: None. Sacred moment.

- **Location**: Ruinmouth Yard

- **Relationships**: R004 strains (Kaisa/crew)

**B1.P4.C2.S2** — "The Close Call"

- **Summary**: Run goes wrong. Surface creatures attack—but not randomly. They're targeting equipment, not people. They're trying to strand the crew. Kaisa realizes: they want prisoners, not corpses. The crew escapes barely.
- **Stakes**: Surface creatures escalating; capture intent confirmed
- **Content**: V4 (attack), H4 (tactical horror)
- **Seeds Planted**: B1-S024 (capture attempt → B2 when Kaisa is spared)

**B1.P4.C3.S2** — "The Protection Refused"

**B1.P4.C4.S2** — "The One Ally"

- **Location**: Same
- **Time**: Late night
- **Summary**: Torven and Sigurd alone. He admits he took this contract to atone for clients he failed. He admits she ignored his mentor's warnings out of arrogance. They don't become friends. They understand each other.
- **Stakes**: Character moment; mutual respect
- **Content**: P3 (vulnerability), S3 (brief physical connection—resonance-heightened)
- **Dark Humor**: (Torven) "If we die tomorrow, I want you to know—you're still insufferable." (Sigurd) "And you're still a thug. But you're my thug."

---
