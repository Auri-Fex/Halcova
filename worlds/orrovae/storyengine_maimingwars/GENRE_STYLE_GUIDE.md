# GENRE LOCK: DARK FANTASY STYLE GUIDE
## Keeping Orrovae in the Fantasy Lane

**Purpose**: This document establishes mandatory genre framing for all Maiming Wars content. Orrovae is **dark fantasy**, not science fiction. This distinction affects word choice, framing, and explanation style throughout.

---

# THEMATIC STORY SPINE

**Axis 1 — Power/Cost**: *"Every miracle has a supply chain. Every body keeps a ledger."*
**Axis 2 — Rebellion/Empire**: *"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."*

These themes should infuse all genre expression: Power/Cost manifests as *debt, burden, price, ledger, receipt*. Rebellion/Empire manifests as *bondage, sovereignty, chains, freedom, ownership*. Use fantasy vocabulary for both.

# THE CORE DISTINCTION

## What Makes It Fantasy

| Fantasy Element | Orrovae Expression |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Mystical bond** | The Säidesolu is a *partner*, not an organism |
| **Covenant magic** | Healing follows *sworn rules*, not biology |
| **Curse/blessing duality** | Hollowing is an *affliction*, not rejection |
| **Mythic history** | The Sealing is legend, not climate refuge |
| **Spiritual inheritance** | Thread-Memory is *ancestral whisper*, not genetics |
| **Transformed kin** | Surface creatures are *changed*, not evolved |
| **The Scouring** | A cataclysm with mythic weight, not "solar change" |

## What Would Make It Sci-Fi (AVOID)

| Sci-Fi Framing | Why It's Wrong |
|----------------|----------------|
| Biological explanations | Reduces wonder to mechanism |
| Evolutionary language | Implies natural selection, Darwin |
| Scientific method as driver | Characters seek *truth*, not *data* |
| Technical vocabulary | Creates clinical distance |
| Species terminology | Implies taxonomy, classification |
| Genetic inheritance | Thread-Memory is spiritual, not chromosomal |

# VOCABULARY SUBSTITUTIONS

## Mandatory Replacements

| ❌ NEVER USE | ✅ USE INSTEAD | WHY |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| evolved | changed, transformed, adapted | "Evolution" is scientific theory |
| evolution | transformation, change, drift | Same reason |
| species | kind, people, kin | Taxonomic language |
| genetic | inherited, bloodline, Pattern | Implies DNA |
| biology/biological | nature, flesh-truth, the body's way | Clinical |
| organism | creature, partner, presence | Reductive |
| scientific | true, proven, witnessed, documented | Methodology language |
| DNA | Pattern, Thread, lineage | Modern science |
| mutation | change, drift, corruption | Genetic language |
| technology | craft, art, works | Modern word |
| system | order, way, rite, custom | Systems-thinking language |
| data | records, accounts, evidence | Modern |

## Context-Dependent Words

| WORD | OKAY IN | AVOID IN |
|------|---------|----------|
| research | Sigurd's medical work (he's a healer) | Framing explanations |
| evidence | Legal/documentation context | Scientific proof context |
| experiment | Sigurd's desperation (tragic) | Clinical investigation |
| anatomy | Medical description | Classification |

# FRAMING GUIDELINES

## The Säidesolu

**Fantasy Framing** (Correct):
> The Säide is a partner bonded through Covenant—a living presence that shares the body and answers to sworn agreements. It heals because that is the bond. It can be persuaded, negotiated with, even angered. When it leaves, it is abandonment, not rejection.

**Sci-Fi Framing** (Wrong):
> The Säidesolu is a colonial organism that integrates with human fascia and accelerates cellular regeneration through biochemical processes regulated by Covenant programming.

## Thread-Memory

**Fantasy Framing** (Correct):
> Thread-Memory carries the whispers of those who bore the Säide before—impressions, feelings, half-remembered moments that were never yours. The dead speak through the Pattern, if you know how to listen.

**Sci-Fi Framing** (Wrong):
> Thread-Memory is an epigenetic storage mechanism where experiential data is encoded in the symbiote's cellular structure and transferred to subsequent hosts.

## The Surface Creatures

**Fantasy Framing** (Correct):
> The creatures above are kin—changed by ten thousand years under the poisoned sky, transformed until their own ancestors wouldn't know them. But they remember. The Thread carries what the flesh forgot.

**Sci-Fi Framing** (Wrong):
> Surface creatures are an evolved subspecies of homo sapiens that adapted to actinic radiation through natural selection over approximately 500 generations.

## The Scouring

**Fantasy Framing** (Correct):
> The sun changed. Some say it was punishment; some say it was natural; some say the ancestors did something to deserve it. Whatever the cause, the sky became poison, and those below sealed the gates against those above. The Scouring is what we call the dying—of the surface, of the abandoned, of the truth.

**Sci-Fi Framing** (Wrong):
> Solar output shifted toward higher UV radiation approximately 10,000 years ago, rendering the surface uninhabitable for Säide-bearers and triggering mass migration to underground habitats.

## Constructs (Säideframes)

**Fantasy Framing** (Correct):
> Säideframes are neither alive nor dead—they are *bound*. A Säide colony given scaffold instead of flesh, oath instead of will. They serve because they are sworn to serve. When they question, it is because the Thread whispers truths older than their oaths.

**Sci-Fi Framing** (Wrong):
> Constructs are artificial hosts for Säidesolu colonies, programmed through Covenant protocols to perform designated functions with limited autonomous decision-making.

# EXPLANATION PHILOSOPHY

## How to Handle "Why Does X Work?"

**In Dark Fantasy**: Things work because of *bonds, oaths, ancient agreements, and the nature of the world*. The "why" is often *unknown, mysterious, or disputed*.

**Characters may:**
- Have theories (often wrong or partial)
- Cite tradition ("It has always been so")
- Reference myth ("They say the first Säide was a gift from the deep")
- Acknowledge mystery ("No one truly knows why the Thread carries memory")

**Characters should NOT:**
- Provide complete scientific explanations
- Use experimental method language
- Resolve mysteries through data
- Explain magic as technology

## The "How Much to Explain" Rule

| Question Type | Explanation Level |
|---------------|-------------------|
| How do I do X? | Practical (Covenant terms, ritual steps) |
| Why does X work? | Mysterious (tradition, theory, myth) |
| What is X made of? | Vague (flesh-stuff, Thread-matter, the deep's gift) |
| Where did X come from? | Mythic (legends, disputed origins) |

# TONE MARKERS

## Dark Fantasy Tone (Target)

- **Atmosphere**: Oppressive, claustrophobic, thick with history
- **Wonder**: Dread-tinged, sublime, terrible beauty
- **Mystery**: Preserved, even when characters learn
- **Violence**: Visceral, consequential, body-horror adjacent
- **Hope**: Hard-won, fragile, costly

## Sci-Fi Tone (Avoid)

- **Atmosphere**: Clinical, observed, documented
- **Wonder**: Explained, categorized, understood
- **Mystery**: Solved through method
- **Violence**: Technical, tactical, clean
- **Hope**: Progressive, technological, inevitable

# THE FEEL TEST

When writing or editing, ask:

1. **Does this sound like it could appear in a medical textbook?** → Rewrite
2. **Would a character need a science degree to say this?** → Rewrite
3. **Does this explain the mystery away?** → Rewrite
4. **Could this appear in Tolkien, Le Guin, or Abercrombie?** → Good
5. **Does this preserve wonder while showing consequence?** → Good

---

# GENRE LOCK STATEMENT

**The Maiming Wars is dark fantasy.**

- The Säidesolu is magic, not biology
- The underground is a cursed refuge, not a bunker
- The surface creatures are transformed kin, not a subspecies
- Thread-Memory is ancestral whisper, not genetic storage
- The Scouring was cataclysm, not climate change
- Healing is covenant-bond, not medical technology

When in doubt: **more Abercrombie, less Asimov**.

*"The Säide doesn't heal because of what it is. It heals because of what we promised each other, a long time ago, when the first bearer made the first Covenant. We forgot the words. The Säide remembers."*
— Apocryphal, attributed to the First Writ
