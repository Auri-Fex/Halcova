### Scene 1

> *Kaisa -- Surface, Sector Seventeen, Midday*

---

The run to sector seventeen wasn't supposed to happen for another three days, which was the standard interval that Ruinmouth protocols established between consecutive expeditions to the same territory--time for the surface to settle, time for conditions to stabilize, time for whatever unpredictable processes governed the world above to do their unpredictable work without human interference. But Kaisa had called in favors with the scheduling coordinator, had traded shifts with two other runners who owed her from previous exchanges, and had managed to arrange a solo return that the official logs would record as equipment inspection rather than deliberate investigation. The Yard didn't encourage solo runs, didn't approve of runners who developed personal agendas about specific sectors, but the Yard also didn't monitor every expedition with the attention that monitoring would require, and Kaisa had learned long ago that the space between official policy and practical oversight was where interesting work happened.

The clearing was exactly where she remembered it, which shouldn't have been surprising but somehow was--the surface had a way of rearranging itself between visits, of making familiar territory unfamiliar through processes that nobody fully understood and that the scientific community had largely stopped trying to explain because explanations required data and data required sustained observation and sustained observation required presence that the surface made prohibitively expensive. But the clearing remained, the gap in the ruins where whatever structure had once stood had collapsed completely, the space where she'd found the arranged bodies six days ago and photographed them with the thoroughness that runner training demanded.

The bodies were still there. That was the first thing she noticed, the confirmation that her previous discovery hadn't been hallucination or exposure effect or any of the other explanations that people used to dismiss surface observations that didn't fit comfortable categories. Four bodies, arranged at the cardinal points, arms extended toward center.

But something had changed.

Kaisa approached slowly, her Säide quiet in the way it always went quiet on the surface but her own senses sharp with the attention that survival demanded. The arrangement was different--not dramatically different, not obviously rearranged, but shifted in ways that her pattern-recognition training made impossible to ignore. The bodies had been moved. Slightly. Deliberately. The angles of their arms had changed, the orientation of their positioning had rotated maybe fifteen degrees from where it had been before, and in the center of the clearing where previously there had been nothing but debris-covered ground, there were now objects.

She stopped at the edge of the arrangement, documenting with the camera she'd brought specifically for this purpose, capturing images of what she was seeing before she got close enough to disturb anything. The objects in the center were small--she couldn't identify them from this distance, couldn't determine whether they were salvage or debris or something else entirely--but they were arranged with the same precision that characterized the bodies, positioned in patterns that suggested intention rather than accident.

"Surface rules," she murmured to herself, the phrase that runners used when circumstances defied normal logic. "Something's responding to observation."

Her Säide pulsed faintly, the colony's diminished activity under actinic exposure still capable of communicating basic information. *Caution*, the pulse suggested. *Attention*. Her symbiote might be suppressed by the surface light, but it wasn't entirely silent, and what it was telling her was that the situation warranted more care than she'd been exercising.

She moved closer, each step deliberate, each movement calculated to minimize disturbance while maximizing observation. The objects came into focus as she approached--not salvage, not debris, but things that looked almost like offerings. A piece of fabric that might have been part of a runner's suit, weathered but recognizable. A tool that she identified as a standard-issue surface compass, the kind that runners carried for navigation in conditions where normal orientation methods failed. A small collection of stones arranged in a pattern that might have been geometric or might have been coincidental, depending on how much significance you were willing to assign to rocks positioned in a clearing full of other rocks.

And in the center of the collection, placed with obvious care on what appeared to be a flat piece of debris that served as a kind of display surface, was a photograph.

Kaisa's breath caught. The photograph was old--decades old, from the visible degradation of the image--but protected somehow, preserved in a way that random surface exposure wouldn't have permitted. She couldn't see the image clearly from her current position, couldn't determine what the photograph depicted, but the presence of it suggested something that she wasn't entirely ready to process.

Surface creatures didn't use photographs. Surface creatures, according to everything she'd been taught and everything she'd observed in twelve years of running, were adapted survivors whose intelligence was alien and whose communication methods were incomprehensible by human standards. They watched. They tracked. They occasionally attacked when conditions warranted. But they didn't collect photographs and place them in arrangements that runners might find.

Unless everything she'd been taught was wrong. Unless the incomprehensibility wasn't inherent but constructed, wasn't natural but assumed, wasn't the result of actual alien cognition but of human unwillingness to recognize cognition that didn't match expected patterns.

She knelt at the edge of the arrangement, close enough now to examine the photograph without disturbing its placement. The image was a portrait--a woman's face, the features blurred by age and exposure but still recognizable as human. The woman was wearing surface gear, the style distinctive enough to place the photograph in a specific era, maybe thirty years ago based on the equipment design. The woman's face showed the weathering that surface work produced, the seamwork patterns visible on exposed skin--

Kaisa's Säide pulsed hard, the colony's warning sharp enough to cut through the suppression that the actinic light imposed.

She knew that face. She knew those seamwork patterns. She'd been looking at them on a portrait in her quarters for her entire adult life.

The photograph was her grandmother.

"Solla," Kaisa breathed, the name emerging before she could stop it, before she could think about what it meant that her grandmother's photograph was here, in an arrangement that something on the surface had created, placed with deliberate care among offerings and positioned bodies and evidence of intelligence that nobody wanted to acknowledge.

Her grandmother had disappeared thirty-two years ago. Her grandmother had been presumed lost to surface conditions. Her grandmother had transmitted messages about patterns in the ruins before she vanished, and those messages had been filed under exposure delirium because filing them there was easier than thinking about what they might mean.

Someone--something--had found this photograph. Had preserved it. Had placed it here, in a location that Kaisa had documented six days ago, arranged in a pattern that suggested communication rather than chaos.

The surface was sending her a message.

Kaisa photographed everything--the shifted bodies, the offerings, the photograph of her grandmother positioned at the center of arrangements that she was only beginning to understand. She worked with the methodical precision that her training demanded, documenting every detail because documentation was what she could do and because the alternative was sitting here trying to process implications that were too large to process in a single encounter.

Then she took the photograph.

She knew she shouldn't. She knew that removing elements from surface arrangements was discouraged, that disturbing evidence was counterproductive, that the scientific method required observation without interference. But this was her grandmother's face, her grandmother's image, her grandmother's presence in a place where her grandmother had been missing for longer than Kaisa had been alive, and leaving it here felt like abandonment in a way that leaving other artifacts never had.

The surface had sent her a message. She was going to take the message home and figure out what it meant.

### Scene 2

> *Kaisa -- Surface, Edge of Ruinfield, Afternoon*

---

The return route took her along the edge of the ruinfield, the boundary zone where collapsed structures gave way to the open terrain that characterized the less-damaged sectors. Kaisa moved with the steady pace that solo running required, conserving energy while maintaining progress, her attention divided between navigation and the photograph that she'd secured in her gear pack and the implications that her mind kept circling back to despite her efforts to focus on immediate survival rather than long-term questions.

She almost missed the watcher.

Her Säide pulsed--not the sharp warning of immediate threat, but the sustained warmth of attention, the colony's diminished awareness still capable of detecting presence even when it couldn't provide the detailed analysis that underground operation permitted. Kaisa stopped, letting her own senses take over where her symbiote's senses failed, scanning the terrain ahead with the patient observation that surface work had taught her.

The creature was maybe fifty meters distant, positioned on a debris pile that gave it elevation and sight lines, watching her with the stillness that predators used when they didn't want to be noticed and that prey used when they didn't want to provoke. It was humanoid in the way that surface creatures were humanoid--bipedal, proportioned roughly like a person, but scaled and adapted in ways that made the resemblance unsettling rather than reassuring.

The skin was translucent in patches, and those patches were the worst part--worse than the scales, worse than the adapted proportions, worse than anything that could be dismissed as alien. Through the translucent sections, Kaisa could see the seamwork. Not the subtle integration lines that marked healthy underground partnerships, but thick cables of symbiotic tissue that pulsed with visible movement, that pressed against the inside of the skin like something trying to escape, that traced patterns across the creature's torso and arms and neck in configurations that looked almost like writing. The seamwork was black against the paler tissue beneath, dark veins of colony material that had spread further than any underground Säide would, that had integrated so completely that the boundary between host and symbiote was no longer clear.

She could see the creature's heartbeat through one of the translucent patches--not just the pulse, but the organ itself, wrapped in colony tissue that moved in rhythm with the cardiac muscle, the Säide having become so integrated that it was part of the circulatory system rather than merely connected to it.

Surface creatures had Säide. That was known, documented, part of the accepted understanding of what had happened to the humans who'd been stranded above when the Scouring began. They'd adapted, had been adapted by, had merged with their symbiotes in ways that the underground population had avoided, and the result was something that looked like humanity had once looked but that had diverged far enough to seem alien even when the family resemblance was undeniable.

This one was watching her. Specifically, deliberately, with the focused attention that suggested assessment rather than simple awareness.

Kaisa didn't run. Running triggered pursuit, and pursuit on the surface usually ended in ways that runners didn't survive. Instead she stood still, maintaining the position that non-threatening communication required, letting the creature look at her while she looked at it and hoping that whatever calculation it was making would conclude in favor of continued observation rather than action.

The creature moved.

Not toward her--that would have required response, would have demanded the defensive measures that runner training provided for situations where distance closed without consent. Instead it moved sideways, descending from its elevated position with the fluid grace that adapted bodies developed in environments where clumsiness was extinction, crossing to a different debris pile that held something Kaisa hadn't noticed until the creature drew her attention to it.

Another arrangement. Another pattern. Bodies--two this time, positioned differently than the ones in the clearing, but arranged with the same deliberate precision that she'd documented before.

The creature stood beside the arrangement, watching her, and then it did something that Kaisa would spend the rest of her life trying to understand.

It pointed.

First at the arrangement--the bodies, the pattern, the evidence of intelligence that the creature was apparently claiming credit for. Then at Kaisa herself, the gesture unmistakable, the meaning clear even if the implications were not.

*This*, the pointing said. *For you*.

"At least it has the manners to point before it eats me," Kaisa muttered, the dark humor emerging automatically because humor was how runners processed situations that were too strange to process otherwise. But the creature didn't advance, didn't show predatory intent, didn't do any of the things that surface encounters usually involved. It just stood there, pointing, waiting for her to understand something that she didn't have the context to understand.

"Why?" Kaisa's voice emerged before she could stop it, the question that had been building since she'd found her grandmother's photograph, since she'd realized that something on the surface was trying to communicate and had apparently decided that she was the audience worth communicating with. "What are you trying to tell me?"

The creature tilted its head, the gesture eerily human despite the features that weren't human at all--the scaled skin, the adapted eyes, the proportions that suggested optimization for conditions that would kill unadapted humans in hours. It made a sound, something between a hum and a rasp, and Kaisa's pattern-recognition training activated automatically, filing the sound away as vocabulary even though she had no dictionary to translate it.

Then it pointed again--at her, specifically at the pack where she'd stored the photograph, at the evidence of her grandmother that she was carrying back to the underground.

*You took it*, the gesture seemed to say. *Good*.

"You knew," Kaisa breathed, the understanding arriving in fragments that didn't quite fit together but that were starting to suggest a shape. "You knew I would come back. You knew I would find it. You put it there for me to find."

The creature watched her for another long moment, its expression unreadable but its attention undeniable. Then it turned and moved away, disappearing into the ruinfield with the efficiency of something that belonged to this environment in ways that Kaisa never would, leaving her alone with her questions and her photograph and the certain knowledge that the surface was not what she'd been taught it was.

She stood there until her Säide pulsed again, the colony's warning that she'd been stationary too long, that exposure was accumulating, that survival required movement regardless of what revelations she was processing. Then she continued toward the breach point, her body performing the familiar motions of surface navigation while her mind worked on problems that surface navigation couldn't solve.

The creatures were intelligent. The creatures were communicating. The creatures had preserved her grandmother's photograph for thirty-two years and had arranged to return it to her in a way that couldn't be dismissed as coincidence or accident.

The surface had a message for the underground, and Kaisa was apparently the one who was supposed to receive it.

### Scene 3

> *Helmar -- Administrative Complex, Records Room, Same Afternoon*

---

The records room was one of the few spaces in the Administrative Complex that Helmar could access without logging the access through official channels, which was a remnant of his previous position that his new position hadn't yet required updating. He'd come here to do legitimate work--reviewing archived documentation for a classification project that his department needed completed--but the work had been cover, and what he'd actually been doing was examining older files from the facilities that had appeared in his private archive, building the evidence base that his conscience was beginning to demand even as his professional training insisted that evidence-building was someone else's responsibility.

He wasn't expecting Grigor.

The clerk appeared from between the archive stacks with the silence that people developed when they wanted to approach without being heard, materializing at Helmar's elbow before Helmar registered movement in his peripheral vision. Helmar's Säide pulsed warm--alarm, recognition, the cognitive enhancement that made surprising him more difficult than surprising most people but that apparently hadn't made it impossible.

"Grigor." Helmar kept his voice neutral, the professional tone that revealed nothing about the internal alarm that Grigor's presence was generating. "I didn't expect company."

"You're researching the same facilities I am." Grigor's voice was flat, the tone of someone stating facts rather than making accusations. "The processing plant in Sector Seven. The material handling facility in the industrial quarter. The inspection records that don't quite match the resource allocation reports."

"I'm conducting a classification review for my department. The research is legitimate."

"The research is concerning you, which means you're concerned about something, which means you've noticed what I've noticed." Grigor settled onto a nearby stool, the motion suggesting he intended to stay for a while regardless of whether Helmar wanted his company. "The Hollowing certificates. The death reports. The patterns that anyone with eyes could see if anyone with eyes cared to look."

Helmar's training told him to deflect, to deny, to maintain the professional distance that his position required and that Varkus had specifically instructed him to maintain regarding Grigor's inquiries. His conscience--the conscience that had been awakening since he'd connected his husband's death to the facility that was still producing deaths twelve years later--told him something different.

"I've noticed irregularities," Helmar said carefully. "I'm documenting them through appropriate channels."

"There are no appropriate channels." Grigor's laugh was brief and bitter, the sound of someone who'd learned that lesson the hard way. "I filed reports six months ago about the certificate patterns. Identical language, identical timing, identical classifications for deaths that couldn't possibly have identical causes. You know what happened to those reports? Nothing. Less than nothing--the files were reclassified, my access was restricted, and two weeks later I was informed that my research interests were 'noted' by people above my pay grade."

"That's why I'm being careful."

"Being careful won't save you." Grigor leaned forward, his intensity becoming visible in ways that his previous flatness had concealed. "They're killing people, Helmar. Systematically, deliberately, with the precision of an administrative procedure--because it is an administrative procedure. Someone has built a process for murder and documented it like any other institutional function, and we're the people who sign off on the documentation that makes it legal."

"You don't know that it's murder."

"I know that twenty-seven people have died of 'natural Hollowing' in the past four months, all in the same district, all from the same professional communities, all with death certificates that were filed within hours of discovery and classified before anyone had time to examine the bodies. I know that the language in those certificates matches a template that someone created, that the template includes specific phrasing that doesn't appear in any legitimate medical documentation, that the people who died were all connected to oversight functions that someone apparently wanted to stop being overseen."

Helmar felt his Säide processing, the colony's cognitive enhancement organizing the information that Grigor was providing alongside the information he'd already gathered. The patterns matched. The timeline matched. The scope that Grigor was describing was larger than what Helmar had assembled on his own, but the shape was the same--institutional murder, documented with institutional precision, concealed by institutional procedures.

"Twenty-seven," he said quietly. "You're sure about the number?"

"I'm sure about the certificates I've seen. There are probably more that I don't have access to." Grigor's expression shifted slightly, something that might have been hope emerging through the bitterness. "You have access now. Your new position. The Special Documentation Division handles the files that regular clerks can't see."

"I'm being watched." The admission felt like surrender, like the acknowledgment of complicity that Helmar had been trying to avoid since his dinner with Varkus. "My supervisor instructed me to monitor your activities and report anything concerning."

"I know." Grigor didn't seem surprised. "They promoted you specifically to position you between the sensitive files and people like me. You're supposed to be the barrier, the reliable administrator who follows procedure and doesn't ask questions."

"Then why are you telling me this? If you know I'm supposed to report on you--"

"Because I saw your face when you processed your husband's death certificate." Grigor's voice had softened, the bitterness giving way to something that sounded almost like compassion. "Twelve years ago. I was a junior clerk in the same department. I watched you file that documentation with the kind of precision that comes from not wanting to think about what you're filing. I watched you notice the irregularities and document them correctly and go home to whatever empty space you went home to. And I've watched you every year since then, processing files with the same precision, noticing the same irregularities, never asking the questions that would make you have to do something about what you're noticing."

The words struck something that Helmar had been protecting for twelve years, the part of himself that had decided not to investigate Aldric's death because investigation was too frightening and too dangerous and too likely to destroy the stability that surviving Aldric's death had required him to build.

"I couldn't." His voice sounded strange to his own ears, thick with something that might have been grief finally acknowledging itself. "After Aldric--I couldn't afford to know. I couldn't afford to do anything that might make things worse."

"I understand." Grigor's voice was gentle now, the voice of someone who recognized fear because he'd felt it himself. "I understand why you made that choice. I even understand why you're still making it, why you took the promotion and agreed to watch me and are processing files that you know are fraudulent. Fear is rational. Compliance is safe. The system rewards people who don't ask questions."

"But?"

"But you're here." Grigor gestured at the archive around them, at the files that Helmar had been researching, at the evidence of the investigation that Helmar had been conducting despite his better judgment. "You're researching the same patterns I am. You're building documentation that you could use to expose something if you decided to expose it. You've spent twelve years choosing silence, and now you're in a position where silence means actively concealing murder rather than just passively ignoring it."

The distinction mattered. Helmar felt his Säide confirm it, the colony's cognitive enhancement highlighting the logical progression that Grigor was articulating. Not noticing was one kind of complicity. Choosing not to investigate was another. But processing fraudulent documentation, actively participating in the concealment of systematic murder--that was different. That was the choice he'd made when he accepted Varkus's promotion, and it was a choice that his conscience was no longer willing to accept.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

"I want you to help me build the archive." Grigor's intensity was back, but directed now rather than diffuse. "Everything you can access that I can't. The files in the Special Documentation Division, the death certificates that pass through your hands, the patterns that your position lets you see. I'll correlate them with what I have. When the archive is complete--when we have enough evidence that no one can ignore it--we find someone who can use it. Someone outside the administrative system. Someone who has the power to act on what we've documented."

"And if we're caught?"

"Then we're caught, and whatever happens to us happens, and at least we'll have done something instead of filing correctly while people die." Grigor stood, apparently satisfied that the conversation had accomplished what he'd intended it to accomplish. "You don't have to decide right now. Think about it. Look at the files you're processing and ask yourself whether you can keep processing them without knowing what they represent."

He moved toward the archive exit, then paused, turning back to deliver a final observation.

"They're going to keep killing people, Helmar. The pattern isn't going to stop because we want it to. The only question is whether we're going to document what's happening or help them hide it."

Then he was gone, leaving Helmar alone in the records room with the files he'd been researching and the choice that Grigor had just made unavoidable. Report the conversation, as Varkus had instructed. File the appropriate forms, document the concerning behavior, let the institutional process handle an employee who was becoming institutionally inconvenient.

Or do what Grigor was asking. Build the archive. Collect the evidence. Create documentation that might survive whatever the institution decided to do about people who asked inconvenient questions.

For the record, Helmar thought, and the phrase felt like prayer now rather than habit.

For the record: I'm choosing.

He gathered his files, secured them in the case that he'd brought for exactly this purpose, and left the records room without logging the exit because some departures were better left undocumented.

The choice was made. What came next would depend on whether the choice was brave or merely foolish.

Either way, he was no longer the administrator who filed correctly and didn't ask questions. That man had died somewhere in this conversation, and whoever emerged from his place was going to have to figure out what living with conscience actually required.
