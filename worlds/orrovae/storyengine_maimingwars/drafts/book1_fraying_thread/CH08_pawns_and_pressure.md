# CHAPTER EIGHT: PAWNS AND PRESSURE

---

> *Eneko -- Vabakoda Enclave, Council Meeting Room, Morning*

The delegation arrived precisely at the agreed hour, which told Eneko everything he needed to know about their seriousness--punctuality being the tribute that power paid to its own sense of importance, while the truly desperate arrived early and the genuinely powerful arrived whenever they damn well pleased.

Three of them. Two administrative functionaries whose names he'd already forgotten and wouldn't bother remembering, plus Councillor Varkus Miren himself, wearing the kind of modestly expensive clothing that said "I could afford better but I'm showing respect by dressing down." Eneko had been navigating these particular currents for four decades, and he recognized the costume for what it was: a man who wanted something and thought flattery would get it.

"Councillor Eneko." Varkus extended his hand in the Seeded fashion, palm showing to demonstrate no hidden weapons--an ancient custom that meant nothing now but persisted the way all such gestures did, through pure inertia and the human need to perform sincerity rather than simply possess it. "Thank you for receiving us."

"My people appreciate the Council's willingness to discuss our concerns directly." The language was ritual, and they both knew it. Eneko shook the offered hand and noted the smoothness of Varkus's palm--no calluses, no scars, the kind of skin that had never done anything more strenuous than sign documents and shake hands. "Though I confess curiosity about the nature of this particular visit. Your message mentioned 'mutual opportunity.'"

Varkus smiled the way politicians smiled when they thought they were being clever. "Shall we sit?"

The meeting room was modest by necessity--Vabakoda didn't have resources to waste on impressive chambers, and Eneko had long since learned that meetings conducted in comfortable settings produced more honest discussions than those held in spaces designed to intimidate. Let the Seeded have their towering halls and crystalline light fixtures. His people had survived ten thousand years by being practical.

They sat. Tea was offered and accepted. The functionaries arranged their documentation with the fussiness of people who existed primarily to create documentation, and Eneko waited with the patience that had served his community through three generations of neglect, two periods of active persecution, and one attempted forced integration that had ended badly for everyone involved.

"The current political climate," Varkus began, stirring his tea in a way that suggested he was more interested in the gesture than the beverage, "presents challenges for all parties. I'm sure you've noticed the... unrest."

"My people have noticed that three of our members have been beaten in the past two weeks," Eneko said, keeping his voice conversational even as he watched Varkus's functionaries exchange a glance that told him they hadn't known this particular detail. "And that the authorities have shown remarkable difficulty identifying the perpetrators, despite the incidents occurring in public spaces with numerous witnesses."

"Regrettable." Varkus set down his tea. "Which brings me to the nature of our discussion. The Council is aware that certain destabilizing elements have begun targeting... vulnerable populations. We believe a coordinated response would benefit everyone."

Eneko had been expecting something like this, though he hadn't known what form it would take. The Unseeded were always either invisible to Seeded politics or suddenly useful when those politics required a vulnerable population to protect, champion, or sacrifice. The timing suggested the latter.

"What kind of coordination did the Council have in mind?"

"Public support." Varkus leaned forward, adopting the posture of a man sharing confidences. "The Unseeded voice their support for certain... stabilizing measures. In exchange, the Council ensures your community receives the protection it deserves."

The protection it deserved. Eneko had spent forty years hearing variations on that particular phrase, and he'd learned to translate it into its actual meaning: "Do what we want and we'll try not to let anything too terrible happen to you." It was the kind of protection that evaporated the moment it became inconvenient, and the kind of exchange that turned his people from citizens into tools.

"Which stabilizing measures, specifically?"

Varkus's smile didn't falter, but something behind his eyes shifted--the subtle recalculation of a man who'd expected easier compliance. "The Council is concerned about certain factions that are spreading... unhealthy ideas. Ideas that undermine social cohesion. You've perhaps heard of the reformers' movement?"

"I've heard of people being murdered and their deaths classified as natural causes." Eneko kept his tone mild, conversational, the voice of a man asking about the weather rather than the systematic elimination of political inconveniences. "I've heard of bodies with damage that doesn't match any natural Hollowing pattern. I've heard of families being told their loved ones simply... failed."

The functionaries were no longer exchanging glances. They were staring at their documentation with the intensity of people who very much wanted to be somewhere else.

"Rumors," Varkus said, though his voice had lost some of its practiced smoothness. "Spreading such rumors is precisely the kind of destabilizing behavior the Council wishes to address."

"Ah." Eneko nodded as though this clarified everything, which in a sense it did. "You're asking my people to publicly support silencing the people who are asking questions about murders. In exchange for protection from the people who are committing them."

"That's an... uncharitable interpretation."

"Is it?" Eneko picked up his own tea, which had cooled to exactly the temperature he preferred--one small advantage of not having a Säide meant his body temperature didn't fluctuate with symbiotic activity, making beverage consumption considerably more predictable. "Consider the situation from my position, Councillor. The Unseeded have no Säide to manipulate, no colony tissue to corrupt, no Thread connection to sever. We cannot be Hollowed. We cannot be threatened with the particular horrors being visited upon your people. And yet you come to us asking for support against the very factions investigating those horrors."

"The reformers--"

"Are not my concern." Eneko set down his tea with careful precision. "But you're asking my people to make them your concern by opposing them publicly. To put Unseeded faces on a position that protects those who are killing Seeded citizens. To make us targets for those who would strike back."

Varkus's composure was fraying at the edges now, the practiced diplomat giving way to something rawer. "The Council can offer substantial benefits--"

"The Council can offer promises." Eneko stood, a clear signal that the meeting was approaching its conclusion whether Varkus wanted it to or not. "And promises, in my experience, are the currency of those who have nothing else to spend. My people have survived by being useful to no one's agenda but our own. I don't intend to change that now."

"You're making a mistake." Varkus rose as well, and for a moment the mask slipped entirely--beneath the diplomatic veneer was a man who had expected compliance and received something else entirely, and who wasn't sure how to process the experience. "The coming months will be... difficult. Those without allies will find themselves exposed."

"My people have been exposed for ten thousand years." Eneko moved toward the door, forcing the delegation to follow or be left sitting in someone else's meeting room--a small humiliation, but the kind that accumulated in the political consciousness. "We've survived being primitive, dangerous, and defective. We'll survive being something new. The question is what you'll call us after we're the only ones still standing."

He opened the door and waited. The functionaries gathered their documentation with the haste of people fleeing an uncomfortable situation. Varkus paused at the threshold, and for a moment Eneko thought he might say something genuine--some honest admission of what this had actually been about.

"Consider our offer," Varkus said instead, which was its own kind of answer. "The situation is fluid. Alliances may become more... valuable as events progress."

"My people will consider the Council's interest with the attention it deserves." Which was to say no attention at all, but diplomatic language existed precisely to make such refusals sound like acknowledgments. "Safe travels, Councillor."

He watched them leave, and then he stood in the empty meeting room for a long moment, calculating the implications of what had just happened. The Council wanted Unseeded support against the reformers. That meant the reformers were becoming a problem. Which meant the conspiracy--whatever it actually was--was worried enough to seek additional tools.

His people had just been offered the opportunity to become those tools.

The tea had gone cold. Eneko drank it anyway, because waste was a luxury Vabakoda couldn't afford, and because the bitter taste suited his mood.

---

> *Eneko -- Vabakoda Enclave, Youth Assembly Hall, Evening*

The young were angry.

Eneko had expected this--youth was always angry, in his experience, because youth could still afford the emotional expenditure of outrage. Age taught you to ration your fury the way you rationed everything else, saving it for moments when it might accomplish something and suppressing it when it wouldn't. But these particular young people had more cause for anger than most, and their faces showed it in ways that made him feel every one of his sixty-one years.

The assembly hall was full tonight. Word had spread about the delegation, about the Council's "offer," and the community wanted to discuss their response. Eneko had hoped for measured consideration; he was getting something considerably more volatile.

"They want us to help them cover up murders!" Juhan, seventeen and fierce with the kind of certainty that came from having not yet failed at anything important, stood at the front of the gathering with fists clenched. "They want Unseeded faces saying everything is fine while they kill anyone who asks questions!"

"No one is suggesting we accept their offer," Eneko said, keeping his voice level. "I've already declined on behalf of the council."

"Declined isn't enough." A young woman named Ester--the one he'd noticed watching the community meetings with a little too much attention. "We should be supporting the reformers. Standing with them publicly."

"And making ourselves targets for both sides?" Eneko shook his head. "The reformers are asking questions about Seeded deaths. Seeded politics. This isn't our conflict."

"It's everyone's conflict." Juhan again, louder now. "You think they'll stop with the Seeded? You think the people doing this will look at us and say 'oh, they don't have Säide, let's leave them alone'? We're next. We're always next."

The murmur that went through the crowd suggested he wasn't alone in this assessment, and Eneko felt the gathering shift beneath him--the careful neutrality he'd maintained for forty years suddenly seeming less like wisdom and more like cowardice to a generation that had never experienced the alternative.

"My people," he began, using the phrase that had always reminded them of their shared identity, their collective survival, "have endured by choosing our battles carefully. By refusing to be drawn into conflicts that would consume us without advancing our interests. The Seeded are killing each other--"

"And we're just supposed to watch?"

"Yes." He said it flatly, because the truth sometimes required bluntness. "We're supposed to watch, and survive, and be here to pick up the pieces afterward. That's what we've always done."

"That's what you've always done." Juhan stepped forward, and there was something in his expression that Eneko didn't recognize--a kind of certainty that went beyond youthful confidence into something harder. "You've spent your whole life convincing us to be quiet. To be useful. To not make waves. And what has it gotten us? We're still outsiders in our own Hold. Still treated like defectives because we won't let parasites colonize our bodies. Still--"

"The Säide is not a parasite." The correction was automatic, reflexive--four decades of diplomatic language designed to build bridges rather than burn them. "The Seeded are not our enemies. They're potential allies if we--"

"They're not our allies." A new voice, from the back of the hall. A young man Eneko didn't recognize, holding something--a piece of paper, creased from being folded and unfolded multiple times. "They never will be. But someone is."

The young man pushed through the crowd, and Eneko felt something shift in the room--an attention that had been diffuse now focusing to a point. Others were watching this newcomer with the particular intensity of people who had already heard what he was about to say.

"What is that?" Eneko asked, though a cold feeling in his stomach suggested he already knew.

"The truth." The young man--barely twenty, if that, with the lean hardness of someone who'd learned to fight young--handed over the paper. "About what we really are. About why we're special."

Eneko unfolded it with careful fingers, and found himself looking at a pamphlet. Cheaply printed, the kind of rough production that suggested underground distribution, with a symbol at the top he didn't recognize: a circle with no gap, unbroken and complete.

*THE UNMAIMED: A Message to Those Without Blemish*

He read the opening paragraph and felt something cold settle into his chest.

*"You have been told you are defective. Primitive. Incomplete. But consider: in an age where the Säide-bonded are destroying each other through the very symbiosis they claim makes them superior, who remains untouched? Who cannot be Hollowed, cannot be corrupted, cannot have their Pattern manipulated by those who would weaponize healing itself? The Unseeded are not defective. The Unseeded are PURE. The Unseeded are what humanity was before the contamination began, and what humanity will be after the contamination ends."*

He turned the page.

*"Join us. The Unmaimed recognize no division between Seeded and Unseeded--we recognize only the division between those who can be unmade and those who cannot. You cannot be unmade. This is not weakness. This is STRENGTH."*

"Where did you get this?" His voice sounded strange to his own ears, distant and careful in the way of a man handling something dangerous.

"They're everywhere." The young man--Eneko still didn't know his name, and found he didn't want to learn it. "In the markets, the work-camps, the borders. People are listening. People who understand what we're worth."

"People who want to use you." Eneko held up the pamphlet, forced himself to keep his hands steady. "This--this is poison dressed as praise. They're telling you you're pure because you can't be Hollowed? They're telling you the Seeded are contaminated? Do you know what they're saying about the Seeded, the same people who wrote this? That weak Patterns should be culled. That those who can't recover from wounds shouldn't be allowed to pass their weakness forward. That maiming is a *test* and those who fail deserve to die."

"That's about Seeded." Juhan, but his voice had lost some of its earlier certainty. "They're saying we're above all that."

"They're saying you're useful." Eneko's voice cracked, and he let it--let them hear the fear beneath his control, because fear was the only honest response to what he was holding. "They're saying you're a tool. A weapon they can aim at their enemies without risk, because you can't be turned the way the Seeded can. Today they tell you you're pure. Tomorrow they'll tell you to prove it. And when you refuse--when you hesitate--you'll discover exactly how much they value your purity."

Silence in the hall. The young man who'd brought the pamphlet was looking at him with something that might have been doubt, or might have been the beginning of hatred that came from having your certainties challenged.

"The Unmaimed," Eneko continued, folding the pamphlet and putting it in his pocket because he couldn't bear to look at it anymore, "are building an ideology that requires enemies. Today the enemy is 'weak Patterns.' Tomorrow it will be anyone who opposes them. And when they've finished with the Seeded, when there's no one left to Hollow, do you imagine they'll simply... stop? Let you go? Thank you for your service and return to peaceful coexistence?"

"You don't know that." The young man, but his voice was quieter now.

"I've spent forty years watching how power works." Eneko looked around the room, at the young faces that had been angry and were now uncertain, at the older members who had stayed silent through the debate and were now watching him with expressions that mixed relief with something sadder. "Every movement that claims to protect one group by defining another as contaminated ends the same way. Eventually the definition expands. Eventually everyone is contaminated except the people doing the defining. And by then, it's too late to refuse."

He walked toward the door, because he couldn't stay in this room anymore--couldn't look at these faces and see how close they'd come to believing what that pamphlet was selling.

"Elder Eneko--" Juhan's voice, younger and less certain than it had been.

"The Unmaimed will use us." Eneko paused at the threshold. "The Council will use us. The reformers would use us if they thought we'd help. Everyone wants the Unseeded for something, because we're the only pieces on the board that can't be Hollowed, can't be threatened with the weapon everyone else fears. That makes us valuable. But it also makes us dangerous--not to them. To ourselves. The moment we choose a side, we become expendable."

He left before anyone could respond, because there was nothing more to say and because if he stayed he would see which of them had already made their choice, and he wasn't sure he could bear the answer.

The pamphlet felt like a lead weight in his pocket. *Those Without Blemish*. As if purity were a gift rather than a target.

He walked through the enclave's winding corridors until he found a private alcove, and there he sat in the dark and let himself feel the full weight of what was coming.

They were too late. Not too late to refuse the Council--that was easy, that was just politics. Too late to keep his people out of the war. The Unmaimed had found them. Had recognized what they represented. Had started telling them stories about their own specialness, stories that felt good because centuries of dismissal had left a hunger for recognition that any clever predator could exploit.

Some of them would listen. Some of them had already listened. And once the listening began, the believing was only a matter of time.

"The surface will return to us," he murmured, one of the old phrases from the texts he kept hidden in his quarters. "And we will remember what we were before the Thread."

It had always sounded like hope. Tonight it sounded like a warning.

> *Torven -- Vikstrom Residence, Client Quarters, Night*

The attack came three hours after midnight, which meant someone had done their homework--the compound's security shifted at midnight, with the outgoing team debriefing the incoming, and the window between handoffs was when attention flagged and response times suffered.

Professional work. Torven almost admired it.

He was in the secondary monitoring room when the perimeter alerts triggered, which put him exactly where he needed to be: inside the compound but not at the primary checkpoint, with clear sightlines to the main residence and a back exit that led to the service tunnels. Kris's voice crackled through the communication network immediately.

"Contact, northeast wall. Four incoming, possibly more in reserve."

"Brandel, Vikstrom's room. Eyes on client until I arrive." Torven was already moving, his body flowing through the transition from waiting to fighting with the smoothness of twenty-three years' practice--twenty-three years written in the pale lines that mapped his hands and forearms, every old wound healed by his Säide but preserved as evidence, a ledger of violence survived that would follow him to his grave. "Count?"

"Four confirmed, moving in formation. They're not amateurs."

No. They weren't. Torven had been expecting something like this since the dinner party, since Vikstrom's casual mention of "concerning developments" and the way his wife had looked at the family portrait on the wall--the way people looked at things they were afraid of losing.

He met the first intruder at the intersection of the west corridor and the main hall, a meeting that happened too fast for thought and resolved itself through muscle memory: block, strike, redirect. His palm connected with the man's throat, crushing cartilage with a wet crunch that he felt more than heard. The opponent's momentum turned against him--Torven caught the man's arm at the elbow and wrenched, feeling the joint separate with a pop that sent the intruder screaming to the floor. Torven's knee came down on his windpipe, cutting off the scream mid-note, and blood bubbled from the man's lips where his own teeth had bitten through flesh in the fall.

"Who sent you?" He asked because you always asked, even when you knew the answer would be useless.

The man's face was covered, professional anonymity that told Torven everything he needed to know about the organization behind this. These weren't street thugs or desperate criminals--they were contractors, probably ex-military, equipped and trained for exactly this kind of work.

"The contract's the contract," the man wheezed, which was a peculiar thing to say in this context and suggested a worldview that Torven recognized rather than appreciated. "You understand."

"I understand you're going to tell me who's paying you or I'm going to make this significantly less pleasant."

"Won't matter." The man's voice was calm despite the pressure on his throat, the tone of someone who had accepted certain outcomes. "You're already too late."

The alarm from Vikstrom's quarters split the night like a knife.

Torven was up and running before the sound finished, leaving the downed intruder secured but not incapacitated--he might have information, and dead men were notably uncooperative. The corridor to the client's rooms was thirty meters and felt like three hundred, each step a calculation of what he would find and what he could do about it.

He arrived to chaos.

Brandel was down but breathing, slumped against the wall with the looseness of someone who had been hit with something meant to disable rather than kill. Two more intruders in the room itself--one already engaged with Marten, the second doing something to Vikstrom that involved glowing implements and the kind of sounds that suggested nothing good.

Torven crossed the distance in three steps and removed the second intruder from the equation with an efficiency that would have made his academy instructors proud. The man went down, but not before Torven saw what he'd been holding: a device that pulsed with amber light, connected to Vikstrom's chest by leads that had been attached with surgical precision.

"What the--"

"We need a healer." Kris's voice, from the doorway. "Now. Something's wrong with his Säide."

Vikstrom was convulsing on the bed, his body arching in ways that bodies shouldn't arch, spine bending so far backward that Torven could hear vertebrae cracking under the strain. And beneath his skin--beneath the surface where human flesh should have been stable and predictable--something was *writhing*.

Colony tissue, Torven realized with a cold clarity that felt like falling. His Säide was reacting to something, something that had been done to him in the seconds before Torven arrived. The seamwork was rising to the surface, dark lines that had been invisible moments ago now standing proud of the skin like veins in a straining muscle, pulsing with a rhythm that didn't match his heartbeat. The flesh around the integration points was rippling, actually rippling, like something was trying to push its way out from underneath, and where the colony tissue pressed hardest against the skin, the flesh had gone translucent, showing black shapes moving beneath like worms in rotten fruit.

Vikstrom's mouth opened and what came out wasn't quite a scream--it was higher than that, thinner, the sound of a Säide in distress echoing through its host's vocal cords, the colony crying out through the only voice it had access to. The sound raised the hair on Torven's arms and made his own Säide pulse in sympathetic alarm, his colony recognizing the death-cry of its distant cousin.

"What did they use?" He grabbed the device from where it had fallen, examined it without understanding--technology wasn't his specialty, wasn't his world, he solved problems with tactics and steel and the kind of thinking that didn't require glowing implements connected to people's chests.

"Doesn't matter." Marten, breathing hard, blood on his hands from the intruder he'd disabled. "He needs a Writ. Now."

"Kris--"

"Already called. Saide-Writ emergency response, en route." Kris was at Vikstrom's side, hands pressing against his chest as if pressure alone could stabilize whatever was happening inside him. "Torven, this is... I've never seen anything like this."

The convulsions were getting worse. Vikstrom's skin had taken on a grayish pallor that Torven recognized from corpses, from bodies that had lost their connection to the living, and beneath that pallor something was moving--visible ridges that traced paths across his torso and arms, his Säide responding to whatever had been done to it with a violence that suggested agony.

"They Hollowed him." Torven heard himself say the words and didn't recognize his own voice. "That device. It did something to his Säide."

"He's not Hollow." Kris's hands were still on the client's chest, but her expression had shifted from concern to something colder--the clinical assessment of someone who had seen enough death to recognize its approach. "Yet. But if we don't get him to a Writ in the next... I don't know. Minutes. Less."

Minutes. Torven had built a career on being the person who made minutes count, who turned impossible timeframes into survival through sheer force of competence and will. But this was beyond his expertise, beyond anyone's expertise except the people who dealt with Säide and symbiosis and the horrors that came from weaponizing the thing that kept people alive.

"Litter," he said, because movement was the only thing he could do. "We're carrying him to the Writ ourselves. Emergency response won't make it in time."

The team assembled around him with the efficiency of professionals who didn't need to be told what to do twice, and together they lifted Vikstrom onto an improvised stretcher--sheets from his own bed, the kind of bitter irony that would have made Torven laugh if laughter had been available to him in that moment.

The compound's gates were open. The watchers on the street had vanished--fled or recalled, it didn't matter which. The only thing that mattered was getting their client to the Saide-Writ emergency station before whatever was happening inside him finished happening.

"What's the count?" Torven asked as they ran, because he always asked, because the question was the only thing keeping him focused on movement rather than the horror of what he was witnessing.

"Four down, one escaped." Kris, keeping pace beside the stretcher, her breathing steady despite the run. "All professionals. The device they used--I've never seen anything like it."

"The one I interrogated," Torven said, the words coming between breaths, "said something about a contract. 'The contract's the contract.' But there was something else--a mark on his inner wrist. Circle with a gap in it, like a broken ring."

"Means nothing to me."

"It will." Torven filed the image away with the particular attention he gave to details that would matter later. "Someone's organized enough to build that device and train people to use it. Someone's connected enough to know our client's schedule and our shift patterns. That's not random violence. That's an operation."

The circle with the gap. He'd seen something similar somewhere--in reports, maybe, or whispered rumors about a faction that had been operating in the shadows for months. The Cullers, some called them, though no one seemed to know if that was their name for themselves or a description assigned by their victims. People who believed that weakness should be... removed. That the weak Patterns should be eliminated for the good of the whole.

The same people, perhaps, who had written pamphlets about the "Unmaimed." The same ideology, different targets.

Neither had Torven. But he had seen enough to know what it meant: this wasn't a random attack, wasn't a robbery gone wrong, wasn't any of the things that could be explained away as ordinary violence in an ordinary world.

Someone had found a way to make Hollowing happen on a schedule. To weaponize the bond between human and Säide, turning the thing that kept people alive into the thing that destroyed them. And they had used it on a man whose only crime, as far as Torven could tell, was having dinner with the wrong company commander.

The Saide-Writ station appeared ahead, lit with the amber glow that signified emergency services available, and Torven felt something shift in his chest--not hope, exactly, but the determination of a man who refused to let someone die on his watch.

"Incoming," Kris called ahead, and the doors were opening, and hands were reaching for the stretcher, and Torven finally let himself stop running.

He stood in the street outside the station, breathing hard, watching through the windows as Säide-Writ personnel swarmed around their client, and he thought about the device he was still holding in his hand--the device that had done something impossible, something terrible, something that suggested the deaths he'd been investigating were just the beginning.

"They wanted him Hollowed," Marten said, appearing beside him. "Not dead. Hollowed."

"I noticed."

"Why?"

Torven didn't have an answer. But he was going to find one, because three hours ago he had been a man doing a job, protecting a client, earning his fee the honest way, and now he was a man holding evidence of something that went far beyond contract work into territory that looked a lot like war.

"Secure the compound," he said, because there were still tasks to complete, still competence to demonstrate, still the familiar structure of command to keep him anchored when everything else had gone sideways. "Document everything. I want to know who those contractors were, who paid them, and how they got access to whatever the hell this is."

He held up the device. In the streetlight, its amber glow had faded to something dull and dead, whatever energy had powered it exhausted in the attack.

"And Kris? Find me someone who can explain what this thing does. Discreetly. Because I don't think we want anyone knowing we have it until we understand what we're dealing with."

"Understood."

The team dispersed. Torven stayed, watching the station, waiting for news about a client who might live or might not, might come out human or might come out hollow.

The contract's the contract, the intruder had said. And Torven had understood, more than he wanted to admit.

Whatever was happening--whatever he'd stumbled into--it was bigger than protection work. Bigger than politics. Bigger than anything he'd prepared for in twenty-three years of solving problems with steel and tactics.

But that was fine. He'd spent his whole career being out of his depth and surviving anyway. This was just one more impossible situation to navigate.

The first step was finding out who was playing, and what game they thought they were winning.

The second step was making sure they lost.
