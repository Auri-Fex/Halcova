# REVISION NOTES: HARD R CONTENT GAPS

**Purpose**: Track missing content from scene cards that needs to be added to drafted chapters.

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE BODIES (CH02_the_bodies.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P2.C2.S1 "The Examination", B1.P2.C2.S2 "The Silencing"

**Missing Content**:
- **Gore Level G3**: Autopsy details need expansion. Scene card specifies "autopsy details" and "body horror." Current draft has clinical description but needs more visceral Säide-specific body horror—charred colony tissue, burned seamwork, the smell of cooked symbiote.
- **Seeds Missing**: B1-S016 (weaponized Hollowing mechanism glimpsed) needs clearer planting
- **Dark Humor**: Has some, but could use the specific beat about Academy training irony

**Specific Additions**:
1. Expand morgue examination with G3 gore—describe the Säide colony's appearance when "burned from inside out"
2. Add sensory detail: smell of overcooked tissue, texture of damaged seamwork
3. Ensure the "mechanism" is glimpsed—some hint of HOW this was done

---

## CHAPTER 3: THE SURFACE (CH03_the_surface.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P1.C3.S1 "The Grandmother's Frame", B1.P1.C3.S2 "The Arranged Dead"

**Missing Content**:
- **Horror Level H3**: Creature glimpses should be more visceral. Scene card specifies "surface horror, creature glimpses"
- **Gore Level G2**: Corpse decay descriptions need expansion
- **Dark Humor**: Has the "storage fees" beat but could add more
- **Grandmother's seamwork**: Should be described as "distinctive, almost decorative"

**Specific Additions**:
1. Expand corpse descriptions—decay state, exposure damage, actinic burns
2. Add at least one creature glimpse during the run (shadow, movement, sound)
3. Grandmother portrait should note her unusual seamwork pattern

---

## CHAPTER 4: THE UNSEEDED (CH04_the_unseeded.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P1.C4.S1 "The Morning Assembly", B1.P1.C4.S2 "The Vision Keeper"

**Missing Content**:
- **Discrimination Detail D2**: The denied clinic treatment incident needs more visceral detail
- **Seeds**: B1-S005 (reunification vision → Book 5 ironic death) needs clearer planting
- **Pre-Scouring Texts**: More specific detail about what Eneko reads

**Specific Additions**:
1. Name the child denied treatment, describe the incident
2. Eneko's journal entry should match: "The surface will return to us, or we to it"
3. More detail on the pre-Scouring texts—what do they describe?

---

## CHAPTER 5: THE ARRANGEMENT (CH05_the_arrangement.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P2.C5.S1 "The New Desk", B1.P2.C5.S2 "Grigor's Questions"

**Missing Content**:
- **Seeds**: B1-S003 (construct "glitch" report in the files—dismissed) NOT planted
- **Seeds**: B1-S019 (security apparatus revealed) needs emphasis
- **Dark Humor**: Should include the specific beat about promotion/responsibility

**Specific Additions**:
1. Add a moment where Helmar files a report about a "construct malfunction" without reading it
2. Make the "security apparatus" structure more explicit
3. Add dark humor beat about the promotion

---

## CHAPTER 6: PROOF (CH06_proof.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P2.C2.S1 (third body), B1.P2.C5.S1 (Helmar new role)

**Missing Content**:
- **Gore Level G3-G4**: Emergency treatment gore needs expansion per scene card "G4 (emergency treatment)"
- **Säide Trauma Detail H3**: More visceral description of damaged Säide

**Specific Additions**:
1. Third body examination needs more visceral autopsy detail
2. Helmar's fraudulent certificates scene could use more systemic horror detail

---

## CHAPTER 7: MESSAGES (CH07_messages.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P2.C6.S1 "The Second Run", B1.P2.C6.S2 "The Watcher Seen"

**Missing Content**:
- **Horror Level H4**: First creature sighting should be more visceral
- **Creature Description**: Scene card specifies "humanoid, scaled, with seamwork visible under translucent skin"
- **Dark Humor**: Should include "At least it has the manners to point before it eats me" beat

**Specific Additions**:
1. Expand creature description—translucent skin, visible Säide seamwork beneath
2. Add the specific dark humor beat
3. More detail on the "offerings" arrangement

---

## CHAPTER 8: PAWNS AND PRESSURE (CH08_pawns_and_pressure.md)

**Scene Card Source**: B1.P2.C4.S1 "The Outside Offer", B1.P2.C4.S2 "The Young Ones", B1.P2.C7.S1 "The Failed Protection"

**Missing Content**:
- **Violence Level V4**: Combat scene needs expansion—currently tactical but not visceral enough
- **Gore Level G3**: Säide convulsions need more body horror detail
- **Horror Level H4**: Hollowing horror should be more visceral
- **Seeds**: B1-S015 (watchers → The Cullers faction) needs planting in attack scene

**Specific Additions**:
1. Combat choreography needs more visceral violence—blood, injury detail
2. Vikstrom's Säide convulsions should show visible tissue changes—seamwork writhing, skin rippling
3. Name "The Cullers" or establish the faction identity
4. Add more body horror during the weaponized Hollowing activation

---

## SEXUAL CONTENT NOTE

Per MASTER_INDEX, B1.P2.C4.S3 should contain S3 explicit Torven/partner scene with S-SÄIDE tag (resonance intimacy). This has NOT been drafted. The scene cards don't show this in the detailed breakdown—may be additional scene or different chapter mapping.

**Action**: Clarify with user if sexual content scene should be added and where.

---

## PRIORITY ORDER FOR REVISIONS

1. **Chapter 8** - Most recent, attack scene needs gore/horror expansion
2. **Chapter 2** - Morgue scene is foundational, needs G3 gore
3. **Chapter 7** - Creature encounter needs H4 horror detail
4. **Chapter 3** - Surface run needs corpse gore and creature glimpses
5. **Chapters 4, 5, 6** - Seed planting and detail additions
