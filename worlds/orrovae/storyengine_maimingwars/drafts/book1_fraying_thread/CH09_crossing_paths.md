> *Sigurd -- Säide-Writ Academy, Emergency Ward, Night*

The emergency klaxon had a particular sound that Sigurd had learned to parse over fifteen years of night shifts--the pitch told you severity, the rhythm told you numbers, and the slight warble in the third pulse told you that whoever was operating the console had been on duty too long and their hands were shaking.

Tonight's klaxon was shaking.

He was halfway through documenting Edvard Magnusson's autopsy findings--the third body with identical damage, the third set of notes that would vanish into classified silence--when the ward doors slammed open and chaos announced itself with the urgency of people who were trying very hard not to scream.

"Säide-Writ Aelfson!" One of the junior attendants, pale enough that Sigurd could diagnose her stress levels from across the room. "Emergency intake--they say it's urgent."

"They always say it's urgent." But he was already moving, setting down his documentation pad with the careful precision of a man who knew he might not return to it for hours. "What's the presentation?"

"I don't--they said Säide trauma. Induced. The kind you've been documenting."

Sigurd's feet stopped moving before his mind caught up with them, and for a moment he stood in the corridor between the morgue and the emergency ward, suspended between the dead and the dying with the clarity that came from understanding that both categories were about to expand.

"Induced," he repeated, because the word deserved to be said aloud, to be acknowledged as the horror it represented. "Someone walked in and said their patient's Säide was traumatized by deliberate action."

"A mercenary company. Grast Company, I think. They brought their client."

Grast Company. Sigurd had heard the name--competent work, professional reputation, the kind of protection detail that people hired when they wanted to survive rather than just feel safe. If Grast Company was bringing him an induced Hollowing case, that meant the attacks had escalated from political figures to protected targets.

Which meant the people doing this weren't afraid of consequences.

Which meant things were about to get considerably worse.

"Treatment room three," he said, resuming his movement with the efficiency of a man who had learned that hesitation cost lives. "Tell them I'm coming. And tell them--" He paused at the ward doors, one hand on the frame. "Tell them to describe what they saw. Exactly. I need to know the mechanism."

The emergency ward at night had a quality of controlled desperation that Sigurd had never quite adjusted to, despite the years. The lighting was harsh because soft lighting let details escape, and details in this profession meant the difference between saving someone and watching them fade. The smell was antiseptic over copper over something worse--the organic stench of bodies under stress, of Säide working overtime to contain damage that shouldn't be possible.

Treatment room three was full of people who didn't belong there.

Four mercenaries in tactical gear, weapons holstered but hands twitching with the anxiety of professionals who had failed at their job and were watching the consequences unfold. One woman--the commander, by her bearing--stood closest to the treatment bed with an expression that mixed rage and guilt in proportions Sigurd recognized from his mirror.

And on the bed, the patient.

"Let me see." Sigurd moved through the mercenaries like water through stone, his attention already narrowing to the figure on the table--male, middle-aged, expensive clothing now ruined by the fluids that accompanied Säide crisis. The man was conscious, which was worse than unconscious because it meant he could feel what was happening to him.

And what was happening to him was wrong.

His skin had taken on the grayish pallor that preceded Hollowing, but the pattern was wrong--not the slow fade of natural failure but something violent, as if the color were being drained by force rather than exhaustion. Beneath the surface, his Säide was visible in ways it shouldn't be visible, colony tissue pressing against skin in ridges and whorls that traced agonized patterns across his torso.

"The mechanism is--" Sigurd stopped, because for once the phrase didn't lead naturally to understanding. His Säide reached out, diagnostic protocols engaging with the patient's stressed symbiote, and what it reported back made no sense.

The colony was burning. Not metabolically--there was no fever, no inflammatory response, none of the cascading failures that accompanied natural Hollowing. The tissue itself was being damaged at the cellular level, as if something had convinced the Säide that its own body was a threat.

"What hit him?" Sigurd's voice came out sharper than intended, but he was already moving, hands finding the patient's chest, pressing against the writhing tissue beneath to feel what his Säide was showing him. "What weapon, what delivery method, how long ago?"

"Device." The mercenary commander--Grast? No, that would be the company name. "They attached something to his chest. Glowing. Amber. Pulsed for maybe thirty seconds before we pulled it off."

"Thirty seconds." Sigurd's mind was already calculating, matching what he knew from the corpses against what he was feeling in living tissue. The bodies had shown the end result--total colony destruction, Hollowing completed in hours rather than months. But this was early. This was the process in action.

Which meant he might be able to stop it.

"I need the room cleared," he said, not looking up from the patient. "Everyone except essential medical personnel."

"I'm not leaving until--"

"You're not essential medical personnel." Sigurd finally looked at the commander, and whatever she saw in his expression made her hesitate. "Your client is dying. He's dying in a way I've only seen in corpses. If you want him to survive the night, you'll give me the space to work."

The mercenaries exchanged glances, the silent communication of people who had worked together long enough to argue without words. Then the commander nodded--a short, sharp motion that carried the weight of trust she wasn't sure she should be offering.

"We'll be outside."

"Don't go far. I'll have questions."

The door closed behind them, and Sigurd was alone with his patient and the particular horror of watching a symbiote try to destroy its host.

"Vaska!" He called for his student without looking away from the bed, his hands still pressed against the patient's chest where he could feel the colony writhing. "I need you in here. Now."

His assistant--not student, not anymore, she'd earned better than that--appeared in the doorway with the particular haste of someone who had heard the klaxon and the chaos and understood that tonight was going to be different.

"What's the presentation?"

"Induced Säide trauma. The same mechanism as the corpses, but caught early." Sigurd's hands found a particularly active ridge of colony tissue and pressed, feeling the way the Säide recoiled from contact. "The colony is attacking itself. Something has convinced it that its host is foreign tissue."

"That's not--that shouldn't be possible."

"And yet." He pulled back from the patient, mind racing through treatment options that had never been designed for this scenario. Standard Säide stabilization assumed the colony wanted to survive. Hollowing treatments assumed gradual failure, not active destruction. This was something new.

Something that had been built, designed, weaponized.

"Get me the resonance stabilizers," he said, already knowing they probably wouldn't work but needing to try anyway. "And the sympathetic dampeners. If the colony is attacking because it thinks the host is a threat, we need to interrupt that recognition pattern."

"That could cause permanent bond damage."

"As opposed to the temporary bond damage of dying?" Sigurd's hands were moving again, cutting away the patient's shirt to expose the chest fully, and what he saw there made his Säide pulse with something that felt like nausea. The seamwork--the visible tracery where human tissue integrated with colony tissue--was inflamed and weeping, the elegant patterns of healthy symbiosis twisted into something that looked like writing.

Like messages.

Like warnings.

"The mechanism is..." He forced himself to focus, to see the damage as data rather than horror. "The weapon introduced something that changed the colony's recognition parameters. It's treating its own host tissue as infected. As something to be purged."

The patient groaned--the first sound he'd made since Sigurd entered the room--and the sound carried frequencies that weren't quite human. His Säide was vocalizing through him, expressing its confusion and pain through the only channel it had available.

"It's scared," Vaska said softly, her hand hovering over the patient's arm without quite touching. "His Säide is scared."

"It's dying." Sigurd accepted the resonance stabilizer she handed him--a device that looked like a glass rod filled with amber light, designed to synchronize failing colony rhythms with healthy templates. "And it doesn't understand why. It's following its programming--protect the host from threats--but someone rewrote what counts as a threat."

He pressed the stabilizer against the patient's chest, at the point where the seamwork was most concentrated, and activated it with a pulse of his own Säide energy. The response was immediate: the writhing beneath the skin intensified, the patient's back arching off the table as his colony tried to reject the intervention.

"Hold him down."

Vaska moved to comply, her hands firm on the patient's shoulders while Sigurd adjusted the stabilizer's frequency, searching for the right resonance pattern--the one that would tell the confused colony that it wasn't alone, that there was another Säide here, that the host it was attacking was still human, still worth saving.

"Come on," he murmured, more to the colony than to the man it was killing. "You know what you're supposed to do. You've been doing it for decades. The new information is wrong. The old patterns are right."

The patient's skin rippled as the colony fought itself, one part responding to the stabilizer's reassurance while another part continued its programmed destruction. Sigurd could feel it through his diagnostic bond--the civil war happening at the cellular level, millions of tiny decisions about what was self and what was other, what to protect and what to purge.

"The mechanism." Vaska's voice was strained from the effort of holding the patient still. "What if we can't interrupt it? What if the programming is too deep?"

"Then he Hollows." Sigurd didn't soften the words because softening wouldn't help. "And he becomes the fourth body in my morgue with damage I can't explain to anyone who matters. But we're not there yet."

He increased the stabilizer's output, pushing more resonance energy into the struggling colony, and felt the moment when something shifted--when the civil war tipped, when enough of the Säide recognized the external signal as allied rather than hostile.

The writhing slowed.

The grayish pallor began to recede from the patient's face, not fully but enough to suggest that blood was flowing again in places where it had stopped.

The seamwork on his chest was still inflamed, still damaged, but it was no longer getting worse.

"Interesting," Sigurd said, and meant it in every possible way.

> *Torven -- Säide-Writ Academy, Emergency Ward, After Treatment*

The waiting was worse than the fighting.

Torven had spent twenty-three years learning to move through violence with efficiency and purpose, learning to assess threats and neutralize them, learning to keep his people alive through situations that should have killed them all. None of that training had prepared him for sitting in a sterile corridor while a stranger decided whether his client would live or die.

"What did they use on him?"

The question came from one of his people--Marten, still wearing bloodstains from the intruder he'd disabled--and Torven didn't have an answer. He had the device, secured in a sealed bag, but looking at it told him nothing except that someone with resources and knowledge had built a weapon designed to turn healing against itself.

"I don't know." The admission cost him more than it should have. "But I'm going to find out."

The door to treatment room three opened, and the Säide-Writ emerged--tall, angular, moving with the exhaustion of someone who had just fought a battle without raising a weapon. His hands were steady, Torven noticed, even though his face showed the strain of whatever he'd just witnessed.

"He'll live."

Two words, but they carried weight. Torven felt something release in his chest, tension he hadn't acknowledged draining away with the confirmation that he hadn't failed entirely.

"The damage?"

"Permanent." The Säide-Writ--Aelfson, the attendant had said--met his eyes with the directness of a man who had stopped caring about diplomatic phrasing somewhere around his hundredth patient. "His Säide will never fully trust his body again. Every wound from now on will heal slower, scar heavier. The bond is intact but damaged. He'll feel that for the rest of his life."

"But he's alive."

"For now." Aelfson's gaze moved to the sealed bag in Torven's hand, and something in his expression shifted--professional interest replacing exhausted detachment. "What did they use on him?"

"This." Torven held up the device, the amber glow long since faded to dull crystal. "They attached it to his chest. Pulsed for thirty seconds before we pulled it off."

"Thirty seconds." Aelfson took the bag without asking permission, turning it to examine the device from multiple angles. "Thirty seconds to induce cascade failure. Thirty seconds to convince a healthy Säide that its host was foreign tissue." He looked up, and for the first time Torven saw something beyond clinical detachment in his eyes. "Where did you get this?"

"From the people who attacked my client. Professionals. Well-equipped. They weren't trying to kill him--they were trying to Hollow him."

"A fate worse than death, for most." Aelfson's fingers traced the device's outline through the bag, not quite touching. "I've examined three corpses with identical damage. This is the first time I've seen the mechanism in action. The first time I've had a chance to understand how it works."

"And how does it work?"

The question hung in the sterile air of the corridor, heavy with implications neither of them wanted to name. Aelfson's expression flickered--calculation, assessment, the particular weighing that happened when someone decided how much truth they could afford to share.

"It rewrites recognition patterns," he said finally. "The Säide bonds with its host by learning what belongs and what doesn't. This device... teaches it new lessons. Wrong lessons. It convinces the colony that its own host tissue is a threat to be purged."

"Turning the body against itself."

"Turning the healer against the healed." Aelfson's voice was quiet, but Torven heard the fury beneath the control. "The Säide wants to protect. That's its purpose, its deepest programming. Someone found a way to weaponize that purpose. To make protection into destruction."

Torven had seen a lot of things in twenty-three years of mercenary work. He'd seen violence used for profit, for politics, for pleasure. He'd seen people killed quickly and slowly, efficiently and messily, for reasons that made sense and reasons that didn't.

But this was different.

This was taking the thing that kept people alive and turning it into a murder weapon. This was corrupting healing itself into harm. This was--

"This is war," he said, because the word finally fit.

Aelfson looked at him with something that might have been respect. "Yes. It is."

"The people who attacked my client--they had multiple devices. They came prepared to Hollow multiple targets. And they weren't afraid of being caught."

"Because they know the system is on their side." Aelfson handed the device back, his expression settling into something harder than clinical detachment. "I've filed three reports about induced Hollowing. Three reports that vanished into classified silence. Someone at the Academy--someone with authority--is making sure this doesn't become public knowledge."

"Which means someone at the Academy knows what's happening."

"Or is making it happen."

The corridor felt colder than it had a moment ago, the harsh lighting casting shadows that hadn't been there before. Torven was accustomed to enemies he could see, threats he could assess and neutralize. This was something else--something that lived in documents and decisions, in systems and silences.

"What do you know?" he asked, because that was always the first question in any operation.

"I know the mechanism." Aelfson's hands were still steady, but his voice had an edge that suggested they wouldn't stay that way much longer. "I know the pattern--three deaths with identical damage, all people with political connections to reform movements. I know someone is killing specific targets and making it look like natural Hollowing. What I don't know is who's pulling the strings, or why, or how to stop them."

"I might be able to help with the first part." Torven thought about the watchers who had been observing his client's residence, the professionals who had attacked with military precision, the intruder who had said "the contract's the contract" like it meant something. "The people who attacked tonight--they were contractors. Ex-military, probably. Well-funded, well-equipped, well-organized."

"A faction."

"An operation." Torven had spent enough time in the gray spaces between legal and illegal to recognize the shape of organized violence when he saw it. "Someone is funding this. Training these people. Providing the devices. This isn't random terrorism--it's targeted assassination with plausible deniability."

Aelfson was quiet for a long moment, and Torven could see him processing--integrating new information with existing data, constructing a picture that neither of them wanted to see clearly.

"The corpses I examined," he said finally. "All political figures. All connected to movements questioning Säide doctrine. All officially classified as natural Hollowing despite evidence to the contrary."

"Someone is purging reformers."

"Someone is purging threats." Aelfson's expression hardened further. "Not to the system. To their vision of what the system should be."

The pieces were coming together, and the picture they formed was uglier than Torven had expected. Not random violence, but systematic elimination. Not chaos, but control. Not insanity, but ideology.

"I need to know more," he said. "Everything you've documented. Everything you've observed. If I'm going to protect my people--if I'm going to find the people responsible--I need to understand what we're fighting."

Aelfson studied him with the diagnostic precision of a man who had spent his life reading bodies for signs of dysfunction. Whatever he saw must have satisfied something, because he nodded slowly.

"I have copies," he said. "Hidden copies that haven't been suppressed. But sharing them puts you in danger. Makes you a target."

"I became a target the moment I took this contract." Torven thought about Vikstrom, lying in a treatment bed with a Säide that would never fully trust him again. Thought about the four intruders, the thirty seconds of screaming, the amber glow of a device designed to corrupt healing into destruction. "The question is whether I become an effective target or a useless one."

"Effective targets tend to die faster."

"Useless targets die anyway. At least effective ones take enemies with them."

For the first time, something like a smile crossed Aelfson's austere features--a small expression, quickly suppressed, but genuine.

"You're not what I expected," he said. "From a mercenary."

"You're not what I expected from a healer." Torven extended his hand. "Grast Company. We protect people who need protecting. Sometimes we investigate threats they didn't know they had."

Aelfson took the offered hand--a firm grip, steady despite the exhaustion visible in his face. "Sigurd Aelfson. I treat the wounded, document the dead, and apparently collect evidence that no one wants me to have."

"Then we have something in common." Torven released the grip. "We're both accumulating reasons for powerful people to want us gone."

"That's a depressing foundation for cooperation."

"Most honest foundations are." Torven tucked the device back into his coat, already thinking about contacts, resources, ways to trace the technology back to its source. "I'll have questions. More questions than tonight allows. Will you answer them?"

Sigurd's expression shifted, the calculation returning--weighing risks against benefits, silence against action, the safe path against the necessary one.

"Yes," he said finally. "Because someone has to, and the people who should be asking aren't."

"Not trust."

"Not yet." Sigurd's lips twitched with something that might become a smile under better circumstances. "But respect. You got your client here in time. Thirty seconds of induced Hollowing and he's alive because you moved fast enough. That's not nothing."

"It's not enough either."

"It never is." Sigurd turned back toward the treatment room, his shoulders carrying a weight that Torven recognized from his own mirror. "I need to monitor my patient. Come back tomorrow. Bring your questions. And bring coffee--I'll need it."

Torven watched him go, and then he gathered his company and led them out into the night, carrying a device he didn't understand and questions he couldn't answer and the particular certainty that everything was about to get worse.

> *Torven -- Grast Company Barracks, Midworks District, Later*

**Content Rating**: S3 (explicit), S-SÄIDE (resonance intimacy)

---

The barracks were quiet when they returned, the silence of a space that had been holding its breath and could finally exhale.

Torven sent most of his people to their racks--they'd earned the rest, and tomorrow would require everyone sharp. Kris stayed because Kris always stayed after operations went sideways, her presence a kind of debriefing that didn't require words. They'd worked together for fourteen years, long enough that the silences between them had become their own language.

"Brandel's concussion is mild," she said, settling onto the bench in Torven's quarters with the ease of someone who had claimed that spot a hundred times before. "The Writ at the station confirmed it. He'll be back on rotation in three days."

"Good." Torven was standing at the small window that looked out on the access corridor, watching nothing, processing everything. His hands were steady, which was a lie his body told when his mind was anything but. "The client?"

"Stable. The Academy is keeping him overnight for observation." Kris paused, and Torven heard the question she wasn't asking in the quality of that pause. "You should sleep."

"I watched a man's Säide try to eat him from the inside out." The words came out flat, factual, the tone he used when facts were the only thing keeping him anchored. "Thirty seconds of whatever that device did, and his body became a battlefield. His own healing turned into a weapon against him."

"I know. I was there."

"I know you were." He turned from the window, and Kris was watching him with the particular attention of someone who had learned to read his silences the way he'd learned to read hers. Fourteen years. Longer than his marriage had lasted. Longer than most things in his life had lasted. "I keep thinking about the sound."

"The sound?"

"When his Säide vocalized through him. That--" He stopped, because describing it would mean hearing it again, and hearing it again would mean acknowledging what it had meant. "It wasn't him screaming. It was his colony. His partner. Screaming because it was being forced to destroy the person it was supposed to protect."

Kris rose from the bench, crossing the small space between them with the deliberate grace that characterized everything she did. Her Säide was a combat strain--Vihta-line, aggression-regulation, the kind of symbiote that kept its bearer calm in situations that should produce panic. Torven had always envied that, the way her colony smoothed the edges that his sharpened.

"You need to come down," she said, close enough now that he could feel the warmth of her, the heat that Säide-bearers radiated when their colonies were active. "Your Säide is running hot. I can feel it from here."

She could. That was how resonance worked--colonies recognizing each other, communicating in frequencies that human senses could only interpret as warmth, as pressure, as the particular awareness of someone else's biological truth. His Säide had been running hot since the attack, stress responses cascading through symbiotic pathways that were designed for combat readiness but that didn't know how to stand down from threats that couldn't be fought.

"There's too much to process." His voice sounded distant to his own ears. "The device. The mechanism. What Aelfson told me about--"

"Later." Kris's hand found his chest, palm flat against the fabric of his shirt, and he felt the moment when her Säide reached for his--not intrusion, but invitation. Resonance contact, the kind of communication that happened below words, below thought, in the spaces where colonies negotiated truths their hosts couldn't articulate. "You're not going to solve anything tonight. You're going to spiral until your Säide exhausts itself trying to prepare you for threats it can't identify, and then you're going to be useless tomorrow when we actually need to act."

"And what do you suggest instead?"

Her answer was to step closer, to let her body press against his in the way they'd learned worked best--maximum contact, maximum resonance surface, the kind of touch that let their colonies communicate efficiently. His Säide flared in response, warmth spreading through his chest as his symbiote recognized the offer and accepted it.

"There it is," Kris murmured, her breath warm against his neck. "Let it go. Let your Säide handle it."

What happened next wasn't quite decision--it was surrender, the release that came from trusting someone else to catch you. His hands found her hips as her hands found his shoulders, and they moved together toward the narrow rack that served as his bed, not rushing but not hesitating either.

They'd done this before. After bad operations, after losses, after the particular horrors that mercenary work accumulated. It wasn't romance--neither of them had pretended otherwise in the fourteen years they'd known each other. It was something older than romance, more practical, more honest. Two people who understood each other using that understanding to survive.

Her Säide reached for his as their clothes found the floor, and the resonance that followed was--

Torven had tried to explain it to someone once, someone without a Säide, someone who asked what it felt like when two symbiotes synchronized. He'd failed. The vocabulary didn't exist for the experience of feeling someone else's colony acknowledge yours, of having the boundaries between self and other blur in ways that weren't dissolution but communion.

Kris's Vihta-strain was designed for calm, and as their bodies pressed together--skin to skin, warmth to warmth, seamwork finding seamwork in the dark--her colony offered that calm to his stressed Säide like a gift. His symbiote accepted, the combat-readiness responses finally beginning to ease as the resonance deepened.

Her hands traced his seamwork lines, the integration patterns that mapped where his Säide connected to his nervous system, and the touch sent signals through both biological and symbiotic channels--pleasure on the human side, recognition on the colonial. His own hands found her seamwork in turn, the familiar territory of a body he knew almost as well as his own, the ridges and whorls that made her Säide visible beneath her skin.

"There," she breathed, when he found the primary integration point at the base of her spine, the place where her Vihta-strain connected most directly to her awareness. The sound she made wasn't entirely hers--her colony adding harmonics to her voice the same way his had screamed through Vikstrom's throat, but different. Not pain. The opposite of pain.

Their Säide wove together as their bodies moved, and Torven felt the strange double-sensation that resonance intimacy produced: his own pleasure, and beneath it, around it, through it, the echo of hers transmitted through symbiotic channels. His Säide showed him what her Vihta-strain was feeling--the satisfaction of successful calming, the pleasure of connection, the joy that colonies experienced when their hosts found comfort with compatible partners.

The colonies wanted this, Torven understood. Not in any way he could anthropomorphize--Säide didn't want things the way humans wanted things--but in the sense that resonance intimacy served the symbiotes' purposes as much as it served the hosts'. Connection strengthened bonds. Pleasure reinforced partnership. Two colonies synchronizing during sex were exchanging information, calibrating responses, building the cooperative frameworks that kept both partnerships functional.

When he was inside her, the resonance peaked--maximum contact, maximum synchronization, two colonies and two humans moving together in rhythms that neither species entirely controlled. His Säide pulsed with warmth that had nothing to do with temperature, and he felt her Vihta-strain respond in kind, the two symbiotes communicating in frequencies that his human senses could only interpret as sensation.

The edge came slowly, built by resonance as much as friction, and when it arrived it arrived for both of them simultaneously--colonies triggering cascade responses in their hosts, coordinated pleasure that served the symbiotic imperative of reinforcing beneficial connections. Torven heard himself make a sound he didn't recognize, felt Kris shudder beneath him with responses that were partly hers and partly her Säide's, and for a long moment they existed in the space where human and symbiote stopped being separable, where the partnership that kept them alive became the partnership that let them feel alive.

Afterward, they lay tangled in the narrow rack, skin cooling but seamwork still warm where their colonies continued to communicate at reduced intensity. Torven's Säide was quiet now, the combat-readiness finally faded to something sustainable. The horror of what he'd witnessed was still there--nothing erased that, nothing could--but it had been processed, metabolized, transformed from acute trauma into memory that could be managed.

"Better?" Kris's voice was sleepy, satisfied, the tone of someone whose colony was reporting successful mission completion.

"Better." He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, to the seamwork pattern that marked her Vihta-strain's primary surface expression. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. My Säide was getting anxious watching yours wind tighter and tighter. This was as much for me as for you."

"Mutual benefit."

"The foundation of all good partnerships." She shifted, finding a more comfortable position against him. "Sleep. Tomorrow we have a conspiracy to investigate."

"Tomorrow we have a war to prepare for."

"Same thing." Her breathing was already slowing, her body relaxing into post-resonance exhaustion. "Same thing."

Torven held her, and let his Säide hold hers, and eventually he slept--not well, not peacefully, but enough. Enough to face whatever tomorrow was going to require.

Outside, the city continued its eternal cycling of commerce and conflict and all the small transactions that made civilization possible. Somewhere in that city, people were planning more attacks with amber-glowing devices. Somewhere, people were filing paperwork that scheduled deaths. Somewhere, people were deciding who would live and who would Hollow and who would become another body in a healer's morgue.

But here, in this narrow rack, two people who had chosen each other as partners in the old way--the practical way, the honest way--were surviving the way they'd always survived.

Together.

> *Kaisa -- Her Quarters, Sumpward District, Same Night*

The files were old enough that the paper had started to yellow at the edges, the kind of brittle decay that came from storage in spaces that were never quite dry enough, never quite climate-controlled enough, never quite cared-about enough.

Kaisa handled them with the care they deserved, because these files were all she had left of her grandmother, and because the answers she was looking for might be written in handwriting that had stopped moving thirty-two years ago.

"Final transmission," she read aloud, her voice barely a whisper in the cramped quarters she called home. "Runner Solla Kalevin, Ruinfield Sector, expedition day seventeen."

The official records said her grandmother had been lost to surface exposure--actinic damage compounded by isolation, the kind of slow death that took Runners who pushed too far into the ruinfields for too long. The official records said she'd become delirious in her final days, transmitting increasingly incoherent messages before contact was lost entirely.

But Kaisa had learned not to trust official records.

*"Patterns in the ruins, like writing."*

The transmission was fragmentary, corrupted by distance and interference, but the words were clear enough. Her grandmother had seen something in the surface formations--not random decay, not natural erosion, but pattern. Purpose. Intent.

The same thing Kaisa had been seeing for months.

*"They watch when we cross their territory. They arrange things after we pass. Not random. Not animal. Communication."*

She set down the file and picked up her own documentation--photographs from the past six months, notes from observations that had earned her warnings from her crew leader and suspicious looks from her fellow Runners. The arranged corpses. The offerings. The humanoid figure that had pointed at her and then pointed at the arrangements, as if to say *look at this, look at what we're showing you*.

Her grandmother had seen it first.

*"The creatures aren't attacking because they're not hostile. They're testing. Learning. Trying to understand what we want, what we fear, what we need to survive."*

The handwriting in the margins was her grandmother's--notes added to the official transmission log, personal observations that hadn't been included in the official record. Because the official record hadn't been interested in a Runner's theories about surface intelligence. Because the official record had classified her as delirious, exposure-damaged, another casualty of the ruinfields.

But Kaisa knew better.

She'd seen the same things her grandmother had seen. Not delusions from exposure, but observations from attention. Her grandmother hadn't gone mad on the surface.

She'd started to understand it.

*"If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead. They control that territory completely. The fact that Runners still return means they're choosing to let us. The question is why."*

Kaisa pulled out her grandmother's final photograph--the one that had been found in the arrangements two days ago, preserved for thirty-two years by something that shouldn't have had any reason to keep it. Solla Kalevin stared up at her from the faded image, seamwork visible on her arms and neck, the distinctive patterns that had marked her as something special even among Runners.

"You knew," Kaisa whispered. "You knew they were watching. You knew they were learning. And you kept going back anyway."

The last entry in the file was dated the day before contact was lost:

*"I'm going to try something tomorrow. I'm going to leave them a message--something they can understand. Something that shows I understand them too. If this works, if they respond, it will change everything we think we know about the surface."*

Her grandmother had tried to communicate with the surface creatures thirty-two years ago. She'd gone into the ruinfields with a message, with hope, with the belief that understanding was possible between species that had never tried to understand each other.

And she'd never come back.

But her photograph had. Preserved. Protected. Placed where Kaisa would find it.

"You did it," Kaisa realized, the understanding settling into her bones with the weight of something inevitable. "You made contact. You taught them something. And they've been waiting--for thirty-two years, they've been waiting for someone else to listen."

The creatures hadn't kept her grandmother's photograph as a trophy. They'd kept it as a message.

*Come back. We remember. We're ready to continue the conversation.*

Kaisa gathered her grandmother's files, her own notes, the photograph that had traveled through three decades and an inhuman intelligence to reach her hands. Tomorrow she would report for her regular run. Tomorrow she would do her job, follow her crew, complete her salvage.

But soon--very soon--she was going back to that clearing alone. She was going to do what her grandmother had done. She was going to try to understand.

And this time, she wasn't going to disappear.

*End Chapter Nine*
