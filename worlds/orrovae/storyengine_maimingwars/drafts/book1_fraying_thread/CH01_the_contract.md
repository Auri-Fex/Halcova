### Scene 1

> *Torven -- Grast Company Barracks, Midworks District, Dawn*

---

The training yard smelled of sweat and copper and the particular mineral sharpness that came from Saide-accelerated healing. Torven stood at the edge of the sparring ring, watching his people work through their morning drills with the critical attention that twenty-three years of mercenary service had made automatic. Kris had the new recruits running contact exercises: controlled strikes, defensive responses, the basic vocabulary of violence that every contractor needed before they could be trusted with real work.

"Feet," Torven said, not raising his voice. Didn't need to. The recruit who'd let his stance drift corrected immediately, weight settling back over his center. Good instincts, bad habits. Trainable.

The Grast Company numbered forty-seven active contractors, down from sixty-two at peak strength three years ago. Attrition happened. People retired, died, found other work, discovered that the mercenary life didn't suit them as well as they'd imagined when they signed on. Torven didn't hold departures against anyone. What he held against people was incompetence, and incompetence got corrected or removed before it could get someone killed.

His own Saide pulsed warm beneath his skin, the colony's presence a constant awareness that he'd stopped consciously noticing decades ago. Workhorse strain, the healers called it. Common. Practical. Not the elegant clean-strains that the upper tiers favored, the ones that left no visible seamwork and healed with aesthetic precision. Torven's arms showed the characteristic ridging where his Saide had sealed injuries over the years: pale lines that caught the light differently than surrounding skin, a map of every wound that had required more than surface repair. He'd stopped being self-conscious about the visibility sometime in his thirties. The seamwork was proof of survival. That was enough.

"Rotation," Kris called, and the sparring pairs shifted, each fighter moving to face a new opponent. The drill was designed to prevent comfortable patterns, to force adaptation. Torven approved. Kris had been his second-in-command for six years now, and the man understood that competence came from discomfort, not repetition.

The morning light filtered through the ventilation grates high above, artificial dawn cycling through the spectrum that the underground's lighting systems used to simulate surface conditions. No one alive remembered actual sunlight, but the body's rhythms still responded to the approximation. Torven had read once that the light cycles were calibrated from pre-Scouring records, from a time when humans had lived above and the underground had been mines and storage rather than the entirety of civilization. Ancient history. Irrelevant to the work.

Kris finished the rotation sequence and dismissed the recruits to conditioning. He crossed the yard to where Torven stood, rolling his shoulders in the way that meant he'd taken a hit during demonstration.

"The Valkonen kid has potential," Kris said. "Reactions are fast, once he stops thinking about them."

"He'll either learn to trust his instincts or he won't. Give him another month before we assess."

"Agreed." Kris glanced toward the barracks entrance, where one of the junior contractors was approaching with the kind of purposeful stride that meant messages. "Your appointment's early."

"They always are, when they're scared."

The contractor delivered the notice: the client had arrived, was waiting in the consultation room, had requested privacy protocols. Standard enough for protection work. Torven acknowledged the message and headed inside, leaving Kris to supervise the remainder of morning training.

The consultation room was designed for exactly this purpose: neutral space, comfortable seating, a table between client and contractor that established professional distance without creating adversarial positioning. Torven had furnished it himself when he'd taken over the company leadership fifteen years ago, replacing the previous commander's more intimidating setup with something that encouraged honest conversation. Scared clients lied less when they weren't also feeling threatened by the people they'd come to for help.

The man waiting for him was mid-fifties, well-dressed in the fashion of the merchant guilds, and visibly terrified. His Saide was active: Torven could see the faint warmth in his skin, the slightly elevated color that came from a colony working overtime to manage stress hormones. Upper-tier bonding, probably childhood integration, the seamwork so subtle it was nearly invisible. Money, then. Position. The kind of client who could afford Grast Company rates.

"Aldren Vikstrom," the man said, rising to offer his hand. The grip was firm enough, but his palm was damp. "Thank you for seeing me on short notice."

"Torven Grast. Sit. Tell me what you need."

Vikstrom sat. His hands found each other on the table, fingers interlacing in a gesture that was probably meant to look composed but instead broadcast anxiety. "I need protection. Immediate. Ongoing. Money isn't a concern."

"Money's always a concern. What are you afraid of?"

"Being killed." A pause. "Being Hollowed."

Torven kept his expression neutral. "Those are different concerns. The first one, I can help with. The second one isn't something that happens to people. It happens naturally, or it doesn't happen."

"That's what I thought. Until three of my colleagues died in two weeks."

Torven leaned back slightly, reassessing. Three deaths in two weeks was a pattern. Natural Hollowing didn't cluster like that. The symbiosis failed over time, through accumulated strain or genetic predisposition or simple bad luck, but it didn't synchronize across multiple people in the same professional circle.

"Tell me about the deaths."

Vikstrom's hands tightened around each other. "Halvar Lindqvist. Forty-eight years old. Healthy. No history of Saide complications. Found in his office, Hollowed. The official report said natural causes."

"And you don't believe it."

"I knew Halvar. His family has clean-strain heritage going back generations. His Saide was perfect. People like him don't Hollow naturally." Vikstrom swallowed. "Three days later, Marta Svensson. Different guild chapter, same committee work as Halvar. Same official cause. Then Bjorn Hedlund, a week after that. Same thing. Same committee. Same impossible diagnosis."

"What committee?"

"Trade allocation oversight. We review distribution requests from the lower tiers, authorize or deny based on capacity and precedent." Vikstrom's voice had gone flat, the recitation of facts a defense against the fear underneath. "It's bureaucratic work. Boring. Nobody gets killed over shipping manifests."

"Apparently somebody does."

The silence stretched. Vikstrom's Saide was still working hard, the flush in his cheeks deepening slightly as his colony struggled to regulate the cascade of stress responses. Upper-tier breeding didn't prevent fear. It just made the physical symptoms less visible.

"There's more," Vikstrom said finally. "After Bjorn died, I received a note. No signature. No return address. Just four words."

"Which were?"

"'The Thread remembers you.'"

Torven filed that away. Unusual phrasing. Possibly religious, possibly political, possibly meaningless intimidation. He'd need to research it later. "Do you still have the note?"

"I burned it." Vikstrom's laugh was brittle. "Stupid. Evidence. I know. But I wanted it gone. I wanted to pretend it wasn't real."

"And now?"

"Now I want to not die. I want someone between me and whatever killed my colleagues. I want to live long enough to figure out what's happening." Vikstrom met Torven's eyes directly, the first time since the conversation began. "Can you help me?"

Torven considered the question. Three deaths, impossible diagnosis, threatening note, terrified client. It smelled like faction work, the kind of targeted elimination that the competing power structures sometimes engaged in when political methods failed. Protection contracts against that kind of threat were expensive, dangerous, and frequently unsuccessful. The smart play was to decline, to recommend Vikstrom find a safer line of work and a new city to practice it in.

But Torven had never been interested in the smart play when the work was interesting.

"Standard protection contract," he said. "Round-the-clock coverage, rotating shifts, secure transport protocols. My rates are posted. Payment weekly, in advance, no refunds for early termination by either party."

"Agreed."

"I'll need full disclosure. Everything about this committee work, everyone you've interacted with, every enemy you've made or suspect you might have made. If you lie to me or withhold information that gets my people hurt, the contract ends immediately and you can find someone else to die for you."

"Agreed."

"One more thing." Torven leaned forward slightly. "Going Hollow overnight. You said it like it was possible. Like your colleagues did that."

"They did. All three of them. Healthy in the evening, Hollowed by morning. That's not natural. That's not even supposed to be survivable, the speed of it. But the bodies--" Vikstrom's voice cracked. "The bodies were Hollowed. Empty. Like they'd been wearing their Saide for decoration and it just... left."

Torven didn't believe it. Couldn't believe it, because believing it meant accepting that someone had found a way to weaponize the symbiosis itself, to turn the thing that kept people alive into the thing that killed them. The implications of that were too large to process in a client meeting.

But he also couldn't dismiss it. Three deaths. Same pattern. Same committee. Same terrified survivor.

"Contract accepted," Torven said. "Kris will handle the logistics. I'll handle you personally until we understand what we're dealing with."

Vikstrom's relief was visible, his Saide finally easing as the immediate crisis found a response. "Thank you. I don't--thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. We haven't kept you alive through anything."

Torven rose, the meeting concluded. As he moved toward the door to summon Kris, Vikstrom spoke again.

"Grast. The Thread remembers you. Do you know what that means?"

"No." Torven paused at the threshold. "But I intend to find out."

### Scene 2

> *Torven -- Vikstrom Residence, Midworks District, Evening*

---

The residence was upper-Midworks, the kind of address that announced its owner had money without being ostentatious about it. Three levels, private ventilation system, security doors that Torven noted were decorative rather than functional. Rich enough to afford appearance, not paranoid enough to invest in substance. That would need to change.

Kris had the advance team in position by the time Torven arrived with the client. Two contractors at the main entrance, two more covering the secondary access points, comm links active and tested. Standard deployment for a high-value protection detail, adapted to the specific geography of the space. Kris was good at this work. Better than good. Torven had been grooming him for company leadership for three years now, preparing for the eventual retirement that mercenary work demanded of everyone who survived long enough to consider it.

"Perimeter's clean," Kris reported, falling into step beside Torven as they entered the building. "Neighbors are a merchant family and a guild administrator's widow, both long-term residents, no flags in the background checks. Building security is contractor-grade, which means useless against anything serious. I've got Mira on the roof access and Brandel watching the service tunnels."

"Good. What about the interior?"

"Three floors, twelve rooms, more windows than I'd like but they're on the upper levels where approach is difficult. Main vulnerability is the ground floor office: street-facing, minimal cover, direct line of sight from at least two elevated positions in the adjacent structures."

Torven filed that away. "We'll keep him out of the office. Restrict his movement to the upper floors until we have a better sense of the threat profile."

"He won't like that."

"He'll like being dead less."

Vikstrom was already inside, speaking with a woman Torven recognized as his wife from the background files. Elena Vikstrom, guild administrator in her own right, connected to several of the major trading houses through family ties. The conversation looked tense. She'd apparently not been informed of her husband's concerns until this morning, and the sudden presence of armed contractors in her home was not being received well.

"Mrs. Vikstrom," Torven said, approaching with the professional neutrality that clients' families required. "I apologize for the disruption. Your husband has retained our services for protective purposes. We'll make every effort to minimize the impact on your household."

Elena Vikstrom was tall, sharp-featured, with the kind of seamwork visibility that suggested working-class heritage elevated through marriage. Her Saide was active but controlled, the warmth in her skin held steady rather than fluctuating with emotion. Self-discipline, or excellent training, or both.

"My husband tells me he believes someone is trying to kill him," she said. Her voice was cool. "He also tells me he has no idea who or why."

"Those are the facts as we understand them, yes."

"And you're here to protect him from an unknown threat using unknown methods for unknown reasons."

"Yes."

Elena looked at her husband, then back at Torven. "Then I hope you're very good at your job, Commander Grast. Because this family cannot afford the kind of attention that comes from visible security failures."

"I don't fail visibly," Torven said. "When I fail, no one sees it. That's what I'm here to prevent."

The evening settled into the routine of protection work: establishing protocols, coordinating schedules, briefing the household staff on security procedures they would inevitably forget and need to be reminded of repeatedly. Torven let Kris handle most of it while he conducted his own assessment of the space, looking for the vulnerabilities that formal surveys missed and the opportunities that instinct identified.

The office was as bad as Kris had described: a kill box dressed up as a workspace. Torven made a mental note to have it sealed entirely, to redirect Vikstrom's business activities to an interior room with no exterior exposure. The bedrooms were better, upper floor with limited access points and reasonable sight lines for defensive positioning. The family dining area was acceptable. The kitchen was a disaster, with service entrances and ventilation access and enough sharp implements to arm a small army.

He found Vikstrom in what appeared to be a study, surrounded by documents that he was examining with the frantic attention of someone looking for answers in the wrong place.

"Committee records," Vikstrom said, not looking up. "Everything we've reviewed in the past six months. I keep thinking there must be something here. Some allocation we approved that someone didn't want approved. Some request we denied that made someone angry enough to kill."

"Have you found anything?"

"No. It's all routine. Shipping manifests, resource transfers, nothing that anyone would care about strongly enough to murder four people."

"Three people," Torven corrected.

"Four." Vikstrom finally looked up. "I forgot to mention. Before Halvar, there was another committee member who died. Different cause, supposedly. Industrial accident. But he was on the same committee, reviewing the same allocations. I didn't connect it at the time."

Four deaths. Same committee. One disguised as accident, three as natural Hollowing.

"Name?"

"Edvard Magnusson. Six months ago. He was inspecting a processing facility when a pressure system failed. Killed instantly."

"Was the investigation conclusive?"

"The investigation found equipment failure. Maintenance records showed the system had been flagged for repair twice and the repairs were delayed due to budget constraints. Tragic accident. Nobody's fault except bureaucratic negligence."

"But?"

"But Edvard was meticulous. He reviewed maintenance logs as part of his committee work. He would have noticed if a facility he was visiting had outstanding safety issues. He would have refused to enter until they were resolved."

Torven considered this. Four deaths, not three. A pattern that extended further back than the client had initially revealed, which meant either Vikstrom was still withholding information or the connection had genuinely escaped his notice until the threat became personal.

"I'm going to need a complete list of everyone who's served on this committee in the past two years," Torven said. "Current and former members. And I want to know what happened to anyone who left."

"You think there are more?"

"I think someone is cleaning house, and I want to know how dirty the house was before I can figure out why."

The night watch began at twentieth bell, the artificial markers that the underground used to structure time in the absence of natural cycles. Torven took first shift himself, positioning in the upper hallway where he could monitor both the primary bedroom access and the secondary stairwell. His Saide settled into the low-level alertness that protection work required: not the aggressive readiness of combat, but the patient awareness that let the body rest while the senses remained engaged.

The residence was quiet. The Vikstroms had retired early, stress and fear making the comfort of sleep more appealing than the anxiety of waking. The household staff had been dismissed for the evening, per protocol. Kris was stationed at the main entrance with two contractors rotating perimeter checks. Everything was in order.

Torven's Saide pulsed.

He went still, attention sharpening. The pulse wasn't warning exactly, wasn't the sharp heat that signaled immediate threat. It was resonance: his colony detecting other colonies nearby, the low-level awareness that all Saide-bearers experienced in proximity to each other. Normal, in populated areas. The underground was dense with human life, with symbiotes detecting each other constantly.

But this resonance felt wrong.

Too many. Too close. Too still.

Torven moved silently to the window, staying back from the glass, letting the angle of the light work for him rather than against. The street below was empty at this hour, the neighboring buildings dark, the public spaces cleared as the night cycle encouraged rest and discouraged activity.

He counted the resonance points. Three, maybe four, positioned around the residence in locations that suggested surveillance rather than casual presence. Watching. Waiting.

His comm clicked twice: Kris, signaling contact.

"Movement," Kris said, voice low. "Northern approach. Three figures, staying in shadow. Not advancing, just... present."

"Same south," Torven replied. "Four more. They're surrounding us."

"Engagement?"

"Negative. They're observing. I want to know what they're observing for."

The figures didn't approach. They didn't retreat. They held position as the hours passed, their Saide signatures steady and patient and completely unlike the behavior of any faction threat Torven had encountered in two decades of protection work. Faction operators moved, probed, tested defenses. They didn't simply watch.

Near dawn, the resonance points shifted. Not attacking, not withdrawing. Redistributing, as if the watchers were trading positions, maintaining coverage while rotating fresh observers into the surveillance line.

Organized. Disciplined. Patient.

Torven stayed awake until the artificial morning light began cycling through the ventilation grates, his Saide managing the fatigue that the night without sleep had accumulated. When Kris arrived to relieve him, he delivered his assessment in the flat tone of someone reporting facts rather than speculation.

"Someone wanted us to know they were there. This wasn't surveillance. It was a message."

"Saying what?"

"Saying they can reach him whenever they want. Saying we can't stop them." Torven met Kris's eyes. "Saying they're not afraid of us."

The protection contract had just become significantly more complicated.
