### Scene 1

> *Sigurd Aelfson -- Saide-Writ Academy, Morgue, Crownwalk District, Morning*

---

The body of Halvar Lindqvist had been a guild official in life, forty-eight years old according to the intake documentation, and in death he was rapidly becoming a problem Sigurd suspected the Academy hadn't adequately prepared him to handle--though "prepared" was generous language for an education that had devoted six years to teaching him how to identify anomalies and approximately zero hours to explaining what he should do when those anomalies pointed toward conclusions that powerful people wouldn't want him to reach.

The morgue was cold, which was by design, the ventilation systems calibrated to preserve tissue integrity for extended examination, and Sigurd had been standing over this particular examination table long enough that the chill had worked its way into his joints with the patient persistence of bad weather settling into old wounds. His hands, when he flexed them against the cold, showed the accumulated evidence of eight years in this profession--a map of small cuts and nicks from examination tools, each one healed by his Säide but never erased, the pale lines of old wounds overlapping into a record that his body would carry forever. His Saide compensated as it always did, the colony maintaining his core temperature within the parameters that eight years of symbiotic partnership had established as optimal, but there were limits to what even excellent integration could do about the psychological weight of cold air and dead flesh and the morgue's silence--that heavy quiet that made a man aware of his own breathing, his own heartbeat, the small sounds of his own continued existence that the figure on the table would never make again.

Cause of death, per the preliminary report that had accompanied the body: Natural Hollowing.

Sigurd had examined seventeen Hollowing cases during his training and another twelve since receiving his certification, which was enough experience to recognize the progression that natural symbiotic failure followed--the gradual disconnection of colony from host tissue, the slow decline of regenerative capacity, the months of visible symptoms that gave families time to prepare and gave medical professionals time to document the inevitable with appropriate clinical detachment. He'd seen tremors and cognitive changes and the distinctive dulling of seamwork as dying Saide withdrew their investment in maintaining aesthetic integration, had watched the process unfold across weeks and months with the predictable rhythm of a disease that understood pacing.

Nothing about the body on his table matched that pattern. Either everything he'd learned about symbiotic biology was wrong, or someone had found a way to make Hollowing happen on a schedule that natural processes had never contemplated--and neither possibility was something a man wanted to discover before his morning coffee. Not that he'd had coffee; he'd been called in early for this examination, suspicious in ways he was trying not to think about too carefully.

The seamwork on Lindqvist's arms was crisp, showing the characteristic ridging of a well-maintained workhorse-strain colony--visible in a way that upper-tier patients usually tried to minimize but that working professionals often wore as proof of honest symbiotic labor. The tissue samples Sigurd had taken showed healthy integration patterns throughout the peripheral systems, colony density suggesting careful attention to symbiotic maintenance. Mineral stores were excellent--iron, calcium, zinc all at levels indicating someone who'd invested in proper repair rations rather than skimping on the inputs that let a Säide build proper layers instead of just sealing crude and fast. An investment a man made when he expected to live long enough for that investment to matter. Halvar Lindqvist's Saide had been functioning normally--better than normally, actually--until the moment it hadn't been, and that moment had been catastrophic in ways that Sigurd was still trying to find language for.

He adjusted the examination lamp, bringing the chest cavity into sharper focus, and contemplated the damage he'd uncovered twenty minutes ago with attention usually reserved for things that shouldn't exist but inconveniently did anyway. The smell hit him again as the light shifted--not the usual morgue scent of preservative and cold flesh, but something sweeter and more terrible. Protein heated past its tolerance threshold. Cooked rather than decayed. His Säide recoiled from the odor with the instinctive revulsion of a colony recognizing the death of its own kind.

The Säide colony was dead--that much was expected in any Hollowing case, the fundamental mechanism being that symbiote failure preceded host failure with the inevitability of cause preceding effect--but the pattern of that failure was wrong in ways his training materials had never anticipated. Natural Hollowing left colony tissue intact but inactive, cellular structures preserved even as function ceased, the biological equivalent of a machine that had simply stopped running rather than one that had been destroyed.

This looked like the colony had been attacked from within. The seamwork--the elegant tracery where human tissue integrated with symbiote--had blackened and curled at the edges, charred into configurations that resembled nothing so much as writing in a language of pain. Where healthy colony tissue should have shown the pale amber translucence of dormant cells, Lindqvist's Säide presented a mottled gray-black surface that crumbled at the touch, leaving residue on Sigurd's examination gloves that smelled of burned fat and something worse, something that suggested the colony had tried to fight whatever was killing it and had been consumed by its own resistance. Burn patterns radiated outward from nodal points deep in the tissue--the recognition centers, he realized with growing horror, the very structures that allowed a Säide to distinguish host from threat--suggesting rapid thermal stress originating from somewhere inside rather than applied from outside.

The mechanism, whatever it was, had turned the colony's own processes against it. Had convinced the Säide that its host was foreign tissue to be purged, and in purging, the colony had generated enough metabolic heat to cook itself from the inside out.

Sigurd found himself reaching for his notation pad with the uncomfortable awareness that he was about to document something that would raise questions he might not want answered.

*Colony tissue presents with characteristics consistent with acute thermal damage*, he wrote, falling into the precise technical language that the Academy required and that would, if anyone ever read these notes and asked uncomfortable questions, provide at least the appearance of clinical detachment. *Pattern suggests internal origin point rather than external application. Cellular degradation exceeds parameters observed in standard Hollowing progression by approximately 340%.*

Three hundred and forty percent--he'd run the calculation twice because the first result had seemed like a mistake, the sort of error a tired man made when staring at damage that defied biological sense. But the numbers held. which meant that whatever had killed Halvar Lindqvist's Saide had done so with a violence that made natural failure look gentle by comparison, and Sigurd was increasingly certain that "natural" was exactly the word someone wanted attached to this death for reasons that had nothing to do with accurate medical documentation.

The neural integration points showed similar damage when he examined them, not the gradual withdrawal that characterized standard symbiotic decline but the abrupt severance of connections that had been functioning moments before failure, as if someone had simply cut the lines between colony and host without bothering to ease the transition. The surrounding tissue was inflamed, the body's immune response suggesting that the damage had occurred while Lindqvist was still alive enough to react to it, still fighting against whatever was killing him even as the thing that had kept him alive for forty-eight years burned itself out from the inside.

And there--at the base of the largest neural cluster, where the Säide's primary recognition matrix interfaced with the host's autonomic systems--Sigurd found what made his own colony pulse with sympathetic alarm. A small region of tissue, no larger than a thumbnail, where the burn pattern originated. The damage radiated outward from this point like ripples from a stone dropped in still water, but the epicenter itself showed a different destruction: not thermal, but *chemical*. An introduction. A corruption of the recognition matrix, rewriting the colony's fundamental understanding of what constituted "self" and what constituted "threat."

The mechanism wasn't a weapon in the conventional sense. It was a lie, told at the cellular level, convincing a healthy Säide that its forty-eight-year partnership with its host had been a mistake that needed correcting. And the colony, following its deepest programming to protect through elimination of threats, had eliminated the only threat it could perceive: the body it had sworn to defend.

"The Academy trains us to identify anomalies," Sigurd murmured to himself, the words disappearing into the morgue's careful silence, "but they seem to have forgotten the part about what we're supposed to do when we find them." He almost laughed at the dark irony--six years of education designed to produce exactly the observer who would notice exactly this evidence, while the institution apparently didn't want it noticed. Either the curriculum committee had suffered a spectacular failure of foresight, or someone with a very dark sense of humor had designed a training program specifically to identify people dangerous enough to require monitoring.

That observation would have earned him a sharp look from his instructors, back when sharp looks from instructors had been the worst consequence he could imagine for noticing things that didn't fit expected patterns. He was beginning to suspect that the real world offered consequences considerably less educational.

He was still contemplating that uncomfortable thought when the morgue door opened. He looked up expecting one of the junior students assigned to rotation duty--predictable requests about procedure or supply locations or the eternal question of where the documentation forms were actually kept. What he found instead was Aldric Godwinson, his mentor, sixty-three years old and still active in teaching though he'd reduced his clinical practice in recent years, wearing an expression Sigurd had learned to associate with conversations he was about to regret having.

"I heard you requested the Lindqvist examination," Aldric said, bypassing the usual pleasantries with a directness that was itself a warning sign--the man had never been effusive, but he'd always observed the basic courtesies that civilized academic discourse required, and the absence of those courtesies suggested that whatever was coming next wouldn't benefit from small talk.

"I requested assignment to any recent Hollowing cases that presented unusual characteristics," Sigurd replied, keeping his voice neutral in the way that institutional survival demanded. "This one qualified on multiple criteria."

"On what basis?"

Sigurd gestured toward the open chest cavity, the damage he'd spent the morning documenting now visible in the harsh examination light. "Colony tissue destruction inconsistent with natural progression. Neural severance patterns suggesting acute rather than chronic failure. Immune response indicators showing the host was alive and reactive during the terminal event." He paused, weighing how much directness the situation called for, and decided that his mentor had already abandoned subtlety. "This man didn't Hollow naturally, Aldric. Something killed his Saide, and it did so quickly enough that his body was still trying to fight the damage when his heart stopped."

Aldric moved closer to the examination table, his own assessment of the body brief but focused with the precision decades of experience provided--the man could read tissue damage the way other people read text, intuitions developed across thirty years of practice that Sigurd was probably a decade away from matching. His Saide was a clean-strain variant, Crownwalk bloodline, seamwork so subtle it was nearly invisible. Sigurd had always found something slightly unsettling about that perfection, the way it suggested bloodlines maintained with the same careful attention that breeders gave to livestock.

"You're not wrong," Aldric said finally, straightening from his examination with the careful movement of a man whose joints had started objecting to prolonged positions. "The damage patterns are anomalous. Your analysis is sound."

"Then you agree this warrants further investigation."

"I agree that what you've found is concerning." Aldric's attention shifted from the body to Sigurd directly, and there was something in his expression that looked almost like regret, though what he had to regret about a conversation that had barely started was unclear. "I also think you should be very careful about what conclusions you draw from this evidence, and considerably more careful about who you share those conclusions with."

"Careful?" Sigurd felt his own Saide pulse warm in response to the tension building in his shoulders, the colony reacting to stress hormones with the automatic adjustment that symbiotic integration provided. "A man is dead from what appears to be induced Hollowing--which shouldn't be possible according to everything the Academy taught me--and you're counseling caution?"

"I'm counseling wisdom, which is not the same thing and which I'd hoped six years of training had managed to instill in you despite your unfortunate tendency toward intellectual curiosity." The words could have been harsh, but Aldric delivered them with a weariness that suggested he'd had this conversation before, possibly many times, with results he'd rather not repeat. "You're not the first person to notice anomalies in recent Hollowing cases, Sigurd. You won't be the last. But the people who've raised questions about those anomalies have found their questions... discouraged, shall we say. Discouraged in ways that tend to end careers and occasionally end other things as well."

"Discouraged by whom?"

"By the systems that process these deaths and determine their official causes. By the institutions that certify those causes and archive the documentation. By the very Academy that trained you to observe what you've observed and that would very much prefer you hadn't observed it quite so thoroughly." Aldric held his gaze with the steady attention of someone delivering information they'd rather not deliver but had decided to deliver anyway. "The threads are thinning, Sigurd. Something is wrong at a level considerably deeper than individual deaths, and the people who have the power to stop it have apparently decided that stopping it isn't in their interest--or worse, that whatever is happening serves their interests in ways we're not meant to understand."

The implications settled over Sigurd like the morgue's chill--cold that went deeper than temperature, stayed longer than physical discomfort. He wanted to argue, to demand specifics, to reject the suggestion that the Academy he'd dedicated his professional life to could be complicit in what amounted to murder--but Aldric wasn't given to speculation, had never been a mentor who offered theories without evidence, and the weight in his voice suggested knowledge rather than hypothesis.

"What do you mean, 'the threads are thinning'?"

"I mean that what you're seeing isn't isolated to a single guild official with anomalous tissue damage," Aldric said, and now there was something in his expression that looked less like regret and more like fear, carefully controlled but present nonetheless. "I mean that the damage extends beyond individual hosts to something more fundamental--that whatever is killing these people is affecting their Saide in ways that could propagate through lineage, could pass to children and grandchildren, could corrupt the very mechanism by which symbiotic heritage is transmitted." He stopped, visibly reconsidering how much to say, and when he continued his voice had dropped to something barely above a whisper. "I mean that when you understand what's actually happening, it will be too late to do anything about it. And I mean that you should document what you've found, protect those documents very carefully, and be extremely selective about who sees them."

"You're asking me to hide evidence of what might be murder."

"I'm asking you to survive long enough to matter." Aldric turned toward the door, the conversation apparently concluded as far as he was concerned. "File your report through the standard channels, Sigurd. Note the anomalies in the technical language I know you've already been using. When the administration tells you to classify this case--and they will, probably within days--comply on the surface while preserving your findings somewhere they can't be conveniently lost. The Academy taught you to document; now I'm teaching you why that documentation needs to exist in places the Academy can't reach."

### Scene 2

> *Helmar von Felsmark -- Korrgate Administrative Complex, Records Division, Morning*

---

The death certificate for Halvar Lindqvist arrived in the morning distribution alongside seventeen other pieces of documentation requiring Helmar's attention, and he sorted it into the priority queue he'd established for guild-related materials before allowing himself to actually read the contents--a small ritual of procedural correctness that accomplished nothing practical but made him feel marginally less like a man whose entire professional purpose had been reduced to stamping things that other people had already decided should be stamped.

Form RC-7, standard natural death, authorization stamps current and correctly positioned in the locations that the Records Division had mandated for exactly this fatality type. The Medical Examiner's signature was from the Saide-Writ Academy, certifying authority for all symbiotic-related deaths, and they had never, in Helmar's twenty-three years of processing their documentation, issued a certificate that contained obvious errors or procedural irregularities. Cause of death: Natural Hollowing. The language was technically correct, employing approved terminology that the Medical Standards Board had established for symbiotic failure documentation, every word chosen to convey precise clinical meaning and avoid ambiguity that invited uncomfortable questions.

Technically correct was a phrase Helmar had learned to distrust in much the same way that a soldier learned to distrust "routine patrol" or a sailor learned to distrust "minor squall"--it usually preceded something that was going to require significantly more attention than the language suggested, and it almost never preceded anything pleasant.

He reached for his cross-reference index, the bound volume he'd maintained personally for fourteen years, tracking significant deaths across the administrative district in a system of his own devising that the Records Division had never officially sanctioned but had never specifically forbidden either. The Lindqvist name appeared in the merchant guild registry with an occupation listed as Trade Allocation Oversight, which placed him on the same committee as the two previous Hollowing deaths Helmar had processed in the past two weeks--three guild officials, same committee assignment, same district, same documented cause, fourteen days separating the first from the third, and if that was coincidence then coincidence had developed a considerably more organized approach to its work than Helmar had previously given it credit for.

Twenty-three years of processing death certificates had taught him several things about statistical probability, the most important being that statistics were only as honest as the people collecting them and that probability was a word administrators used to avoid saying "we don't actually know what's happening here." He understood that coincidences occurred, that patterns emerged from random distributions, that the human mind was calibrated to find connections even in pure noise--but he also understood that three deaths in the same demographic, same geographic area, same timeframe, with identical documented causes, exceeded the parameters that random distribution could comfortably explain, and "comfortably explain" was doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence.

Per standard procedure, unusual clustering of deaths in specific demographics warranted review. He should flag the pattern, submit an inquiry request to the Medical Standards Board, initiate the documentation trail that might eventually lead to investigation by people whose job it was to ask questions he was currently choosing not to ask. Per standard procedure--a phrase he'd learned to distrust almost as much as "technically correct."

Helmar set down the certificate and let himself look at it for a moment without the filter of professional assessment, just a piece of paper with stamps and signatures that represented a man who had been alive two weeks ago and wasn't anymore. Halvar Lindqvist had probably expected to live another thirty years, had probably made plans, had probably assumed that his Saide would continue doing what Saide did, keeping him healthy and functional and present in the world in ways that he'd stopped consciously noticing decades ago. The certificate didn't capture any of that--it captured cause and time and location and authorization, the administrative skeleton of a death stripped of everything that had made the person matter.

He thought about the promotion he'd been working toward for three years, the senior coordinator position that would give him oversight of the entire Korrgate administrative district--significantly more responsibility for ensuring that awkward patterns were handled appropriately and considerably less opportunity to pretend he hadn't noticed them. He thought about the dinner last evening with Varkus, about the arrangement they'd reached, about files that needed to flow smoothly during what Varkus had called "this delicate period" with meaningful emphasis that Helmar recognized as the verbal equivalent of a locked door.

He thought about Aldric, which was something he tried not to do during working hours because thinking about Aldric made it difficult to do what working hours required.

Twelve years ago, his husband had noticed irregularities in material shipments--quality control discrepancies, documentation that didn't match physical inventory, patterns suggesting systematic diversion rather than random errors. Aldric had been constitutionally incapable of ignoring irregularities, possessed of that combination of integrity and stubbornness that made him excellent at his job and terrible at surviving the political environments that jobs existed within. He'd investigated, because that was what investigators did. He'd documented, because that was what documentation was for. He'd prepared a report for his supervisors, because he'd believed they wanted to know about irregularities, that the system was designed to correct itself when problems were identified, that doing the right thing and doing the safe thing were the same thing.

He'd had an accident, which was what the documentation said, and documentation was always technically correct.

Helmar had processed that death certificate himself, had noted the irregularities in the timeline that didn't quite add up, the inconsistencies in the witness statements that contradicted each other in ways that thorough investigation should have resolved, the authorization stamps from officials he'd never encountered before attached to departments that didn't appear in any public record he could locate. He'd noted everything, because noting things was what he did, because documentation was his craft and his refuge and the only form of resistance he'd ever managed to practice. And then he'd filed it correctly, because filing things correctly was also what he did, and because the alternative--filing it incorrectly, raising questions, pushing for answers--had seemed at the time like it would accomplish nothing except making him a target for the same forces that had accomplished whatever Aldric's death had accomplished.

The Lindqvist certificate waited on his desk like a test he'd already decided to fail, requiring only his processing seal to complete its journey through the administrative system into the archives where inconvenient patterns went to become invisible. Once sealed, it would be indexed, categorized, stored in the proper location according to the protocols he'd helped establish, effectively disappearing into a system designed to ensure that no one would ever look at it again unless they specifically knew what they were looking for and specifically requested access through channels that would generate documentation of their request.

One death among thousands, technically correct, procedurally perfect, contributing nothing to any understanding of what was actually happening to guild officials in the Trade Allocation Oversight committee.

For the record, Helmar thought, composing the entry he would never file through official channels: Helmar von Felsmark has identified a pattern in recent death documentation. Three guild officials, same committee assignment, same documented cause, same timeframe. Statistical anomaly exceeding probability parameters for random occurrence. For the record, he has chosen not to flag that pattern for official review, because official review would require him to answer questions about why he was asking questions, and those questions would lead to other questions, and eventually the questions would lead somewhere that looked very much like the place Aldric's questions had led.

He applied his processing seal to the certificate with the mechanical precision of a motion he'd performed thousands of times, and placed it in the completed tray, and felt nothing that distinguished this particular complicity from all the other complicities that had accumulated over twenty-three years of doing his job correctly.

The morning's work continued, because morning work always continued, property transfers and guild registrations and resource allocation approvals flowing through his department with the efficiency that his protocols had established. Helmar processed each item with the attention it deserved and the attention it didn't, his seal applied to forms that would outlast him, his signature attached to records that would matter long after he'd stopped mattering, the documentary machinery of underground civilization grinding forward with or without his participation in ways that made participation feel less like choice and more like gravity.

But that evening, in the small study of the residence he'd shared with Aldric and now occupied alone, he added an entry to his personal reference log--the bound journal he kept separate from official records, written in a personal shorthand he'd developed specifically to be difficult for anyone else to interpret, containing every document that had ever made him pause in the twenty-three years since he'd started keeping track.

*RC-7-4471-K. Guild official, Trade Allocation Oversight. Natural Hollowing. Third in pattern--see RC-7-4455-K, RC-7-4462-K. Seventeen days since previous entry. Examiner: Saide-Writ Academy, signature illegible but stamp genuine. Statistical anomaly: significant. Pattern probability: <0.3% assuming random distribution. Cross-reference: Edvard Magnusson (industrial incident, 6 months prior, same committee). Four deaths total?*

He didn't know what he would do with the information, whether there was anything to do, whether the pattern he'd identified meant anything beyond coincidence or whether identifying it accomplished anything beyond making him feel marginally less complicit in whatever was happening. He didn't know if the choice to remain silent would matter to anyone except himself, or if mattering to himself was supposed to be enough, or if there was any version of this situation where the right choice and the safe choice converged.

But he'd noted it. That was what he did, all he knew how to do--and it would have to be enough until something changed or until nothing changed and the patterns continued accumulating in his private log like evidence for a trial that would never be held.

Whatever happened next, he'd noted it. For the record. For whatever the record was worth.

### Scene 3

> *Sigurd Aelfson -- Saide-Writ Academy, Aldric's Office, Afternoon*

---

Aldric's office was a study in accumulated expertise--the sort of space that only developed after decades of a man caring more about his work than his surroundings and allowing that work to gradually colonize every available surface until the room became less a workplace and more an extension of the person inhabiting it. Medical texts climbed the shelves in formations suggesting organizational systems only their owner understood, specimen jars containing preserved examples of unusual Saide formations occupied positions on tables that lesser academics would have dedicated to personal effects, and the anatomical models throughout the space had that quality of objects handled so frequently they'd developed their own patina--knowledge made physical, expertise given form, thirty years of practice pressed into every surface.

Sigurd had been summoned--the correct word, rather than "requested" or "invited"--the message delivered by a junior student with formality indicating official channels had been engaged for purposes that official purposes didn't adequately explain. He'd spent the intervening hours completing his documentation of the Lindqvist examination, encoding his observations in the technical language Aldric had recommended--language that would satisfy administrative requirements while preserving enough specificity that a competent reviewer could reconstruct his actual findings if they knew what questions to ask. He'd also made copies, not strictly within protocol but increasingly necessary given the morning's conversation, and stored them in locations the Academy's administrative systems couldn't easily access.

Small rebellions, probably pointless, but the only kind of rebellion available to a man who still needed his position and hadn't yet figured out what resistance would actually look like.

Now he sat across from his mentor, the desk between them holding documents Aldric had apparently been reviewing before Sigurd's arrival--medical records, from the visible headers, multiple files grouped by some classification system suggesting this conversation would extend considerably beyond a single anomalous death. The office smelled of old paper and preservative chemicals and that mustiness that developed in spaces where ventilation systems competed with decades of accumulated organic material. Institutional memory, Sigurd thought, if institutional memory had a smell--the sort of thought a man had when trying not to think about the implications of the conversation he was about to have.

"I've read your preliminary report on Lindqvist," Aldric said, setting down the document he'd been holding with the careful precision of a man who understood that documents could become evidence depending on who was asking questions about them. "The technical analysis is excellent--thorough, specific, properly conservative in its conclusions while preserving sufficient detail for deeper investigation. You've learned the craft well."

"Thank you."

"That wasn't entirely a compliment." Aldric's expression didn't change, but something in his voice suggested the words carried weight beyond their surface meaning. "Obvious implications are dangerous, Sigurd. They invite questions from people who notice patterns, and questions invite attention from people who prefer patterns to remain unnoticed, and attention in the current climate invites consequences that 'technically correct documentation' won't protect you from--however excellent that documentation might be."

"You mentioned the current climate this morning," Sigurd said, leaning forward slightly because the alternative was leaning back and looking like he was trying to create distance from a conversation he'd specifically been summoned to have. "You mentioned threads thinning and lineage damage and institutional complicity. I've spent the afternoon documenting evidence of what appears to be induced Hollowing, which shouldn't be possible according to everything the Academy taught me, and I've been doing so while wondering whether the Academy's curriculum was incomplete by accident or by design." He met Aldric's eyes directly. "If you have information that contextualizes what I've found, I need to hear it. And if you're going to tell me to be careful again, I'd appreciate knowing what specifically I'm supposed to be careful about, because vague warnings are considerably less useful than specific ones."

Aldric was silent for a moment, his expression shifting through something that might have been approval or might have been regret--or might have been the complexity that came from watching someone walk toward a door you'd tried to warn them about and knowing they were going to open it anyway. Then he reached for the files on his desk and spread them across the surface in a pattern grouping them by some classification Sigurd couldn't immediately identify--dates, perhaps, or examination results, or the names of people who'd asked questions about them and were no longer available to be asked.

"Seventeen cases," Aldric said, his voice flattening into the clinical register that physicians used when they needed emotional distance from what they were describing. "Over the past eight months, documented as Natural Hollowing, processed through standard channels, archived in the usual locations where inconvenient patterns go to become invisible. All presenting anomalies similar to what you observed in Lindqvist--colony damage inconsistent with natural progression, acute rather than chronic failure patterns, immune responses suggesting the host was alive and reactive during terminal events, tissue degradation exceeding standard parameters by factors that make the word 'natural' do rather more work than it was designed to handle."

Seventeen cases. Eight months. Sigurd had examined one body and identified the anomalies within an hour of beginning his analysis, working alone with standard equipment and the training the Academy had provided. Seventeen similar deaths had passed through the system--examined by presumably competent professionals, documented through proper channels, certified by the same authorities that had certified his own competence--without generating the investigation that seventeen obviously anomalous deaths should have generated.

"How is that possible?" he asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer and suspected further that he wasn't going to enjoy hearing it confirmed. "The anomalies are unmistakable to any trained examiner--I can't be the first person to notice colony tissue that looks like it was cooked from the inside out. Seventeen cases should have generated review requests, formal inquiries, at minimum some kind of pattern recognition from the people whose job it is to recognize patterns."

"They did. Early on, before the pattern-recognition systems learned to stop recognizing patterns." Aldric's voice remained even, but something in his posture suggested the memory he was accessing wasn't the kind that improved with time. "Four months ago, a colleague named Torsten Halvorsen filed a report documenting the first cluster of anomalous cases--six deaths at that point, all guild officials, all presenting the same impossible combination of rapid failure and healthy integration indicators. Torsten was meticulous, thorough, the kind of examiner who couldn't look at anomalous data without trying to understand what it meant. He identified the pattern, questioned the Natural Hollowing classification, formally requested Academy resources for deeper investigation into what he called 'an apparent mechanism for induced symbiotic failure.'"

"I don't recognize that name." Sigurd's Saide pulsed warm, the colony responding to stress hormones he was trying to keep off his face. "Where is he now?"

"He Hollowed naturally, according to the official documentation, three weeks after filing his report." Aldric met Sigurd's eyes with directness suggesting he wanted to make sure this particular piece of information landed properly. "His examination--which I conducted personally, because I'd trained him and because I wanted to see for myself--showed exactly the anomalies he'd been documenting in other cases. Acute failure pattern. Colony damage consistent with rapid thermal stress. Immune response indicating the host was alive and fighting during the terminal event. Tissue degradation exceeding natural parameters by approximately the same factor you calculated this morning." A pause that felt like it was measuring whether Sigurd understood. "Torsten Halvorsen was killed using the same mechanism he'd discovered, and his death was processed through the same system that classified all the other anomalous cases as natural occurrences, and I filed his death certificate with exactly the language the system required because the alternative was joining him in the archives."

The weight of it settled into Sigurd's chest like ice water. Torsten Halvorsen--a name he'd never heard, a colleague he'd never met, an examiner whose work had apparently been thorough enough to notice what Sigurd had noticed this morning--had been killed for noticing. Killed using the very phenomenon he'd been investigating. Killed and documented and filed away with all the proper stamps and signatures while the system that should have investigated his death worked instead to ensure no one would ever ask the right questions about it.

"You're saying someone is inducing Hollowing deliberately," Sigurd said, testing the words against the silence of the office the way he'd tested similar words against the silence of the morgue this morning. "That there's a mechanism--a weapon, effectively--that can cause symbiotic failure on demand. And you're saying that when people investigate that mechanism, they become targets for it."

"I'm saying that the pattern extends beyond individual deaths in ways that make 'pattern' an inadequate word for what's actually happening. I'm saying that whatever mechanism is being used can be deployed against specific targets with enough precision that Torsten Halvorsen--who understood the danger, who was presumably being careful, who knew exactly what he was looking for--died three weeks after filing a report about it." Aldric's hands had gone still on the desk, no longer organizing files, just resting there as if motion had become difficult. "And I'm saying that the systems we trust to investigate this kind of thing have been compromised at levels that make investigation considerably more dangerous than ignorance."

"Then why tell me?" Sigurd heard the edge in his own voice, the frustration that came from understanding implications without understanding what to do about them. "If investigation leads to termination, if the systems are compromised, if Torsten Halvorsen died for doing exactly what you're asking me to do--why invite me into this? Why not let me file my technically correct report and go back to believing the institutions I've dedicated my career to are actually worth dedicating a career to?"

Aldric was quiet for a long moment--the silence of a man choosing between several possible answers and not particularly liking any of them. When he spoke, his voice carried something Sigurd associated with confessions rather than instruction. The weight of admission, of things a man would rather not say but had decided needed saying anyway.

"Because I'm sixty-three years old, and my Saide has been showing irregularities for the past two months--the kind of irregularities that don't appear in the training materials because the training materials assume irregularities are random rather than targeted." The words came slowly, each one placed with deliberate precision. "Because I've spent my career trusting institutions that I now understand were never designed to be trustworthy, were designed instead to process inconvenient information until it became convenient. Because someone needs to continue the work when I can't continue it, and you're the most capable student I've ever trained, which means you're also the most capable of surviving what training you should have received and didn't."

Sigurd wanted to ask about the irregularities, wanted to offer diagnostic resources, wanted to do something that looked like action rather than conversation. But the look on Aldric's face suggested that offers of help would not be welcome, that the mentor who'd spent six years teaching him how to identify problems had already identified his own problem and found no solution worth implementing.

"And the lineage damage," Aldric continued, apparently determined to complete the information transfer regardless of its emotional cost. "This isn't just about individual deaths, Sigurd. It's about what gets passed forward. Saide colonies don't exist in isolation--they carry impressions from previous hosts, Thread-Memory, the formal term that most people dismiss as myth because myths are easier to ignore than mechanisms. What happens to a colony during induced failure can affect what it passes to future generations. If someone has developed a way to damage colonies at a level that compromises lineage transfer, then they're not just killing individuals. They're potentially corrupting bloodlines across generations, ensuring that the children of victims inherit colonies that carry the damage forward like a scar that never quite heals."

The implications cascaded through Sigurd's understanding like structural failure propagating through a building, each realization triggering another collapse, the architecture of his assumptions about the world falling away to reveal something considerably darker underneath. If induced Hollowing could damage colonies at a level that affected lineage transfer, then targeted killings weren't just eliminating inconvenient individuals--they were potentially sterilizing bloodlines, corrupting the symbiotic heritage that connected generations, transforming murder into devastation that lasted beyond the death of the immediate victim.

"This is genocide," he said, and the word felt inadequate but accurate. "Not just murder. Genocide with generational reach. Someone is killing people in ways that will affect their children and their children's children."

"That's one interpretation, and probably the accurate one, though the people responsible would undoubtedly describe it differently." Aldric's tone had gone bitter, the clinical distance failing him as he approached the part of this conversation he'd apparently been building toward. "'Selective pressure on defective Pattern expression,' perhaps. Or 'natural correction of symbiotic weakness.' The doctrine is already being constructed--have you heard the phrase 'The Unmaimed'? The belief that those who Hollow were always weak in their Pattern, that their failure reveals an underlying deficiency rather than creating one, that good blood simply doesn't fail in that particular way? It's circulating in certain circles, preparing the ideological ground for what's coming, whatever what's coming turns out to be."

"What is coming?"

"I don't know." The admission seemed to cost him something. "That's the honest answer, Sigurd. I don't know what they're building toward, or who 'they' even are at the highest levels, or what the endgame looks like for people who've apparently developed the ability to kill through symbiotic failure and are using that ability with enough precision to eliminate anyone who notices the pattern. What I know is what I've told you: the pattern exists, investigation is dangerous, the damage extends beyond what anyone wants to acknowledge, and the institutions we might have trusted to address this have been designed--or redesigned--to ensure it remains unaddressed."

Sigurd absorbed this, trying to fit the scope of what Aldric was describing into the framework of institutional reality he'd built his career around, and finding that the framework wasn't large enough to contain it. The Academy had trained him, certified him, given him the skills to identify exactly the anomalies that were apparently being systematically suppressed. If the Academy itself was compromised--if the institution that had taught him to ask questions was simultaneously invested in ensuring certain questions were never asked--what did that mean for everything he'd learned? For everyone he'd trusted? For the professional identity he'd spent eight years constructing?

"What do you want me to do?" he asked finally, because the alternative was sitting in silence while implications continued cascading.

"Document. Preserve. Be careful--and yes, I know I've already said that, but it bears repetition." Aldric began gathering the files he'd spread across the desk, reorganizing them into configurations that looked like ordinary administrative clutter rather than evidence of seventeen murders. "You're young enough and careful enough to survive this, if you're wise about what kind of caution looks like. Don't publish findings through official channels. Don't file reports that can be traced to your credentials. Don't trust the institutional systems that seem designed to receive exactly this kind of information--they're designed to receive it and dissolve it, to process inconvenient patterns until they become convenient noise. Build your own records, your own evidence base, your own understanding of what's happening. And when the moment comes--when someone is positioned to actually act on this information--be ready to provide it to them."

"That's not action. That's waiting."

"Yes. It is." Aldric's expression shifted toward what might have been sympathy if sympathy hadn't required admitting he was asking Sigurd to accept a burden he'd already accepted himself and found no way to put down. "I've spent thirty years in this institution, watching colleagues disappear, seeing research suppressed, observing patterns I didn't understand until the understanding came too late to matter. The people who tried to act directly--who filed reports through proper channels, who demanded investigations, who insisted that institutions behave like institutions are supposed to behave--those people are gone. The people who are still alive are the ones who learned to wait, who understood that survival sometimes means accepting impotence while positioning yourself to be useful when impotence is no longer the only option."

"And you think waiting will change anything?"

"I think the alternative is dying without accomplishing anything, and I think dying without accomplishing anything is a particularly stupid way to respond to a situation that requires people who understand it to remain alive long enough for their understanding to matter." Aldric stood, the conversation apparently reaching whatever conclusion he'd intended it to reach. "You asked me once why I became a healer, and I told you it was because I wanted to understand how things work. That's still true--understanding is still what drives me, what made me good at this work, what made me notice patterns I should have been trained not to notice. But understanding isn't the same as fixing, Sigurd. Sometimes the best you can do is preserve the understanding until someone capable of fixing arrives, and sometimes preserving understanding means accepting that you won't be the one who does the fixing."

Sigurd rose as well, the files on his mentor's desk now reorganized into their original configuration, the evidence of seventeen deaths invisible again behind the ordinary appearance of academic administration. The office looked exactly as it had when he'd entered--shelves of medical texts, specimen jars, anatomical models, the accumulated weight of thirty years of practice--but his perception of it had shifted in ways that wouldn't shift back.

"When you understand," he said, echoing Aldric's phrase from that morning in the morgue, "it will be too late."

"Yes. That's the pattern." Aldric moved toward the door, indicating that Sigurd should precede him out of the office and back into the Academy's corridors, where conversations like this one had apparently never happened and where patterns like the one they'd discussed would continue being processed into invisibility. "But 'too late' isn't the same as 'too late for everyone.' The question is whether the people who understand can protect their understanding long enough for it to matter to the people who come after--whether knowledge preserved becomes knowledge eventually used, or whether it just becomes another pattern that no one was ever positioned to act on."

Sigurd left the office with more questions than he'd entered with and fewer certainties than he'd held that morning. The body in the morgue, the pattern in the records, the scope of the conspiracy his mentor had outlined--all of it pressed against his professional confidence in ways that demanded responses he wasn't sure he could provide. The Academy's corridors looked the same as they always had--students moving between lectures, administrators processing paperwork, the ordinary business of medical education proceeding with all the institutional confidence that institutions cultivated regardless of what was actually happening within their walls--but something had shifted. Wouldn't shift back.

He could document. That much was clear, was within his capabilities, was the one form of resistance available to a man who still needed his position and hadn't yet figured out what open resistance would look like. He could preserve what he'd found in places the Academy couldn't easily access, could build his own records outside the institutional systems designed to dissolve inconvenient information, could position himself to be useful when usefulness became possible.

And when the moment Aldric described arrived--if it arrived, if the patterns eventually generated someone positioned to act rather than just to understand--he would be ready to provide what he'd preserved.

That would have to be enough. For now it was all he had, and *enough* apparently meant something different when applied to situations that couldn't be fixed--only documented, only preserved, only waited out with the patient endurance of someone who understood that understanding wasn't the same as fixing. Sometimes the best you could do was survive long enough for your survival to matter.

### Chapter Notes

**Seeds Planted**:
- Torsten Halvorsen: previous investigator, killed by same mechanism (named death for later reference)
- Seventeen cases over eight months (conspiracy scope established)
- Thread-Memory / lineage damage concept introduced (generational stakes)
- "The Unmaimed" doctrine mentioned (ideological preparation for eugenics program)
- Aldric's own Saide showing irregularities (foreshadows his death in Part 2)
- Helmar connects Edvard Magnusson (industrial accident, 6 months prior) to pattern--four deaths total

**Sensory Immersion**:
- Morgue: chill settling into joints, examination lamp shadows, smell of preservation
- Records Division: paper and stamps and procedural silence, the weight of archives
- Aldric's office: accumulated expertise made physical, old paper and preservative chemicals

**Character Voice Achieved**:
- Sigurd: clinical precision shot through with dark humor about institutional absurdity
- Helmar: bureaucratic detachment masking profound guilt, sardonic observations about "technically correct"
- Aldric: weary expertise, regret for knowledge he's passing on, bitter about institutions

**Dark Humor Beats**:
- "paid" being generous language for Academy stipend
- "technically correct" as phrases Helmar learned to distrust
- coincidence having "developed a considerably more organized approach"
- documentation that "met every standard and would never be questioned"
- Sigurd wondering if curriculum was incomplete "by accident or by design"

**Thematic Setup**:
- Institutional complicity in murder (both characters notice, both choose different complicity)
- Documentation as resistance (both keep private records)
- "Understanding" vs. "action" tension (survive to matter vs. act and die)
- Pattern recognition across professional domains (reader sees more than either character)

**Causality Achieved**:
- Same deaths (guild officials) seen from medical and bureaucratic angles
- Reader now knows more than either Sigurd or Helmar individually
- Conspiracy scope visible through parallel perspectives
- Both characters documenting privately creates eventual convergence possibility

**Word Count**: ~7,200
