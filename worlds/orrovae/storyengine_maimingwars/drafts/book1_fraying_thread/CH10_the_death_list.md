> *Helmar -- Administrative Complex, Senior Records Division, Late Night*

The irregularity was small.

Helmar had spent thirty years learning to see small irregularities--the misaligned stamp, the inconsistent signature, the form number that didn't quite match the processing sequence. His Säide enhanced his memory for such details, storing every document he'd ever processed in a mental archive that never quite let him forget how many papers had passed through his hands on their way to outcomes he'd chosen not to consider.

Tonight's irregularity was a file folder that had been placed in the wrong cabinet.

He found it while organizing the backlog from his promotion--the "sensitive documentation" that Councillor Varkus had mentioned with such careful vagueness, the files that "needed to flow smoothly" during this "delicate period." Most of them were exactly what he'd expected: personnel transfers, resource allocations, facility reports with redacted sections and authorization levels above his clearance.

But this folder didn't belong with the others.

The label read "Projected Outcomes, Q4-Q1 Transition Period," which was bureaucratic language that could mean anything from budget forecasts to construction schedules. The filing code indicated it should have gone to his superior's office, not the general processing queue. A small error. The kind that happened when someone was working late and their attention flagged.

Helmar should have set it aside. Should have placed it in the interdepartmental courier bin for proper routing in the morning. Should have forgotten about it entirely, the way he'd forgotten about so many small irregularities over the years--the way he'd trained himself to forget, because forgetting was easier than understanding.

But his hands had already opened the folder, and his eyes had already started reading, and his Säide-enhanced memory had already begun storing every word with the meticulous precision that had made his career possible.

Names.

The list was organized chronologically, each entry containing a name, a date, and a notation. The notation column used abbreviations he didn't recognize--HI-P1, HI-P2, HI-C, HI-F--but the pattern was clear enough after the first few lines. The abbreviations weren't categories. They were stages.

HI-P1: Hollowing, Induced, Phase One.

He turned to the next page, his hands steady because they'd spent thirty years learning to be steady, and found more names. More dates. Some of the dates were in the past--he recognized a few from death certificates he'd processed, casualties of the "natural Hollowing cluster" that had occupied his filing queue for weeks.

Some of the dates were in the future.

The third page listed a name he knew: Vikstrom, Andras. Merchant guild official. Date: three days ago. Status: HI-P2, Interrupted. Notes: "Subject survived. Reassess timeline."

That was the man Torven Grast's company had been protecting. The one who had been attacked. The one whose survival had been treated as a minor inconvenience, a scheduling disruption, something to be reassessed rather than investigated.

Helmar kept reading because his hands wouldn't stop turning pages, because his eyes wouldn't stop processing text, because thirty years of training had taught him to complete documentation reviews before making any assessment--and because some part of him already knew what he would find if he looked far enough into the projected dates.

Page four.

Page five.

Page six.

The entry was on page seven, dated three weeks from tonight.

Von Felsmark, Helmar. HI-C. Notes: "Clearance concerns. Knowledge footprint expanding. Recommend acceleration if pattern continues."

His own name, typed in the same font as every other name on the list, formatted with the same clinical precision, scheduled with the same bureaucratic indifference. Not a person--a projected outcome. Not a death--a procedure. Not murder--an administrative action, filed and categorized and waiting for its proper processing date.

HI-C. Hollowing, Induced, Complete.

The folder fell from his hands, pages scattering across his desk in a disorder that would have troubled him under any other circumstances, that would have demanded immediate organization and proper filing and all the rituals of procedural correctness that had defined his existence for thirty years.

He couldn't move.

Somewhere in the building, a cleaning crew was working the night shift, their footsteps and conversations a distant murmur that reminded him the world was still proceeding normally while he sat in his office discovering that he was scheduled for elimination. Somewhere outside, the city continued its endless cycling of commerce and conflict and all the small transactions that made civilization possible. Somewhere, people were living their lives without the knowledge that someone had created a list, and that the list was being processed, and that processing would continue until every name had been crossed off.

His name was on the list.

The thought kept returning, circling like a predator that had caught a scent and wouldn't be diverted. His name was on the list. Three weeks from now, someone would trigger an induced Hollowing event, and his Säide would turn against him, and he would die in the same way the others had died--screaming, probably, his body destroying itself while some bureaucrat filed the paperwork that would classify his death as natural causes.

He had processed that paperwork himself. Dozens of times. Hundreds.

Every signature on those death certificates had been his own handwriting.

Helmar von Felsmark, the documentation indicated, pursuant to standard procedure for the prevention of information compromise, scheduled for termination by induced Hollowing on the designated date.

He'd built his career on procedure. He'd trusted the system because the system was all he had--after Aldric, after the questions he should have asked and didn't, after the life he'd chosen to protect by choosing not to see what protection cost.

And now the system was going to kill him with the same methodical efficiency it used for everything else.

> *Helmar -- His Apartment, Upper Administrative Quarter, After*

The apartment was dark when he arrived home, because he hadn't turned on the lights, because turning on the lights would have required admitting that he'd arrived somewhere, that he was doing something other than walking through corridors and stairs in a haze that felt like dreaming but wasn't.

He sat in Aldric's chair--still Aldric's chair, twelve years later, still positioned by the window where Aldric had liked to read in the evening light--and he held the pages he'd taken from the folder, and he tried to understand what he was looking at.

Not the list itself. The list was simple: names, dates, projected outcomes. The administrative structure of murder, organized with exactly the care and precision that had made Helmar excellent at his job.

What he was trying to understand was the timeline.

The earliest dates on the list were four years old. Four years of induced Hollowing events, documented with the same meticulous attention to process that characterized every other administrative function in Korrgate. Four years of deaths that had been classified as natural, investigated as routine, processed by clerks who saw exactly what Helmar had seen and chose exactly what Helmar had chosen--to file correctly and ask nothing.

Aldric's death was twelve years ago. Before the list. Before the current program.

But the infrastructure had to come from somewhere.

Helmar pulled out his documentation pad and began searching his own files--the mental archive his Säide maintained, perfect recall of every document he'd ever processed. He wasn't looking for the list now. He was looking for patterns. The same kind of patterns he'd spent thirty years learning to ignore.

Aldric had been a quality inspector. Industrial sector. Material shipments that didn't match their documentation. Facilities that received supplies but produced no recorded output. Personnel transfers to departments that didn't appear in the organizational hierarchy.

Aldric had asked questions. Aldric had filed reports. Aldric had--

The death certificate surfaced from memory, every detail preserved with Säide-perfect clarity. Helmar had processed it himself. Noted the irregularities. The cause of death was listed as "Industrial accident, equipment failure," but the autopsy report had shown internal damage inconsistent with external trauma. He'd flagged it as a filing discrepancy. He'd sent the flag through proper channels. The flag had been acknowledged, classified, and archived.

He'd gone home to an empty apartment and he'd chosen not to ask.

The infrastructure for killing Aldric had been the same infrastructure that was now killing reformers with induced Hollowing. Different methods, maybe. Different authorization levels. But the same patterns--questions suppressed, investigations redirected, documentation designed to create official truth from unofficial horror.

He had processed Aldric's murder.

He had signed off on it, and filed it, and archived it, and he had spent twelve years telling himself that his job was accuracy, not investigation, and now he was going to die the same way because the system had decided his accuracy was no longer useful.

The pages in his hands showed the schedule for the next six months. Dozens of names. Political figures, reform advocates, people who had asked questions or supported people who asked questions or simply occupied positions that someone wanted occupied by someone else.

And Grigor Sealkeeper, dated eight days after Helmar's own listing. HI-C. Notes: "Access risk. Complete termination of records personnel recommended following von Felsmark closure."

Grigor, who had shown him the identical death certificates. Grigor, who had told him someone was killing people and making them sign off on it. Grigor, who had asked the questions that Helmar should have asked twelve years ago and hadn't.

They were both going to die, and their deaths were already scheduled, and somewhere in this building there was probably a file folder with the authorization signatures and resource allocations and all the proper documentation required to murder two clerks who knew too much.

For the record, Helmar thought, and almost laughed, except that laughing would have required feeling something other than the numbness that came from discovering that the system you'd trusted had been designed to destroy you.

He should run. He should take the documents and flee, find somewhere outside the administrative hierarchy where the scheduling wouldn't reach him, become someone without a name on a list waiting for its processing date.

But where would he go? The list included names from every tier of Korrgate, every sector, every administrative division. The system was everywhere because the system was everything, and running from it would just mean dying tired instead of dying seated in Aldric's chair, looking at pages that proved everything he'd spent thirty years refusing to believe.

Aldric had asked questions. Aldric had died.

Helmar had filed the death certificate. Helmar had stayed silent. Helmar was going to die anyway, because silence only protected you until it didn't, until someone decided that even your silence was a risk worth eliminating.

For the record: he had processed his own husband's murder. He had signed off on the documentation. He had gone home and grieved and told himself that grief was enough, that feeling bad about it meant he wasn't really complicit, that the system couldn't be blamed for what the system did because the system was just procedures and he was just a man following them.

The system was going to kill him in three weeks.

The documentation indicated.

Per standard procedure.

Helmar sat in the dark apartment where he had spent twelve years not asking questions, and he looked at the list that had his name on it, and he made a decision that felt like nothing and everything at the same time.

He would not die silent.

The documentation that would destroy him could also expose the people who had created it. The system that had scheduled his death had left evidence--because the system always left evidence, because bureaucracy could not function without records, because the same meticulous precision that made murder possible also made murder traceable if someone was willing to follow the traces.

Helmar was going to follow them. Every authorization, every allocation, every signature that had made this list possible. He was going to document the system that was going to kill him, and he was going to make sure that documentation survived after he didn't.

Grigor. He needed to find Grigor. Give him everything. The list, the patterns, the twelve-year trail that led from Aldric's death to Helmar's scheduled termination.

For the record, he thought again, and this time the words felt different--not bitter, not broken, but purposeful. For the record that someone would read after he was gone. For the record that would outlive the system that created it.

He stood up from Aldric's chair, and he gathered the pages, and he went to find the one person who might understand what to do with them.

Three weeks. Twenty-one days to document thirty years of complicity.

It wasn't enough time. It would have to be enough.
