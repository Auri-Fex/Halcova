### Scene 1

> *Sigurd -- Saide-Writ Academy, Morgue, Morning*

---

The third body in two days arrived at seven bells, which was early enough that Sigurd hadn't finished his morning coffee and late enough that he couldn't pretend the delivery was some kind of administrative error that would resolve itself if he simply ignored it long enough. The attendants who brought the covered form seemed relieved to be rid of it, haste in their movements suggesting that whatever was under that sheet had already communicated something unpleasant to people who handled bodies professionally and were therefore not easily unpleasanted.

Sigurd set down his coffee, which had been adequate rather than good and was now going to be cold as well as adequate, and approached the examination table with the clinical detachment that twenty years of medical practice had made reflexive. His Säide pulsed warm in response to his attention, the colony shifting into the diagnostic mode that characterized their partnership--heightened sensitivity to biological information, enhanced pattern recognition, the collaborative awareness that made Säide-assisted medicine considerably more effective than the unassisted variety even when the unassisted variety was practiced by competent professionals.

"Name?" he asked, pulling back the sheet with the economical motion that experience had refined.

"Magnusson." The attendant consulted his delivery documentation with the kind of focus that suggested he didn't want to look at what Sigurd was uncovering. "Edvard Magnusson. Industrial accident, according to the death certificate. Facility requested autopsy for insurance documentation."

Industrial accident. Sigurd's Säide pulsed again, the warmth intensifying in a way that his partnership had learned to associate with significant information, with patterns emerging from data that his conscious mind hadn't yet assembled. Industrial accidents produced certain kinds of damage--crushing injuries, chemical burns, mechanical trauma, the signatures that industrial environments left on the bodies that passed through them incorrectly. What Sigurd was looking at didn't match any of those signatures, didn't match anything that industrial equipment could produce regardless of how creatively that equipment was misapplied.

"Interesting," he said, the word covering a reaction that required more time to process than he currently had available. "You can go. I'll complete the documentation when I've finished the examination."

The attendant left with evident relief, the door closing behind him with the particular sound of someone glad to be elsewhere. Sigurd stood alone with the body that wasn't an industrial accident and the coffee that was definitely cold now and the growing certainty that the patterns he'd been noticing weren't imagination after all.

He worked methodically, the examination proceeding through the standard protocols that the Academy required while simultaneously diverging into the investigative territory that the Academy didn't require but that the situation demanded. External observation first: the body showed no visible trauma consistent with industrial accident, no crushing or mechanical damage, no chemical burns or exposure indicators. What it showed instead was the pallor that came from Säide failure, the distinctive quality of tissue that had lost its symbiotic partner and was beginning the slow process of unaugmented decay.

The seamwork was the worst part. In a healthy Säide partnership, the colony's integration lines were subtle, visible only to trained eyes under proper lighting--delicate tracery that mapped the symbiotic interface without calling attention to itself. In Magnusson's corpse, the seamwork had risen to the surface like veins on a corpse bloated with drowning, dark lines that stood proud of the surrounding skin, swollen with dead colony tissue that had nowhere else to go. Some of the integration points had ruptured, weeping a substance that wasn't quite blood and wasn't quite the symbiotic medium that healthy colonies produced--something in between, something corrupted, something that smelled like copper and rot and protein heated past tolerance and left to spoil.

The man had Hollowed. Or rather, the man had been made to Hollow, because Hollowing didn't happen like this, didn't happen overnight, didn't happen to people who showed no prior symptoms and no predisposing conditions and no history that would suggest they were at risk.

"Let me see," Sigurd murmured, addressing himself and his Säide simultaneously, the habit of vocalization that had developed over years of working alone with only his symbiote for intellectual companionship. He made the first incision with the steady hands that his profession required, opening the chest cavity to examine the organs beneath.

The smell hit him first--that same copper-rot-sweetness from the external ruptures, but concentrated now, intensified by the sealed environment of the chest cavity. His Säide recoiled, the colony's warmth flaring into something close to distress, the symbiotic equivalent of nausea at what they were witnessing. The Säide colony had spread throughout Magnusson's thoracic space the way healthy colonies did, integrating with cardiovascular and respiratory systems, but the integration had gone wrong in ways that made Sigurd's professional detachment difficult to maintain.

The colony tissue was black where it should have been the pale pink of healthy symbiote. The integration threads that should have been gossamer-fine had swollen to the thickness of cord, bulging against the organs they were supposed to support, looking less like partnership and more like parasitism in its final, failed stages. Where the colony met the heart, Sigurd could see the scarring where tissue had tried to fuse and failed, leaving ragged edges of dead symbiote clinging to cardiac muscle that had been poisoned by its partner's death throes.

The damage was consistent with what he'd found in the previous two bodies, which was both confirmation of pattern and evidence of horror. The Säide colony had died first--that much was clear from the characteristic tissue damage that Säide death left behind, the scarring that occurred when a symbiote integrated for decades suddenly ceased to function. But the colony hadn't died naturally, hadn't failed through accumulated strain or genetic predisposition or any of the known mechanisms that produced Hollowing in clinical literature. The colony had been attacked, destroyed from within by something that Sigurd couldn't identify but could definitely observe the effects of.

His own Säide was communicating urgently now, the warmth and pressure that constituted their diagnostic dialogue conveying alarm alongside information. *Similar patterns*, the colony was saying in the language that twenty years of partnership had developed. *Previous cases. Same mechanism. Not natural.*

"I know," Sigurd said aloud. "I know it's not natural. The question is what it is instead."

He documented everything with the meticulous attention that his training demanded, photographing tissue samples and recording observations and building the evidence file that would support whatever conclusions his investigation eventually produced. The Academy's protocols were clear: unusual findings required documentation, documentation required analysis, analysis required reporting through appropriate institutional channels. Sigurd had followed those protocols for his entire career, had believed in them the way physicians were supposed to believe in the systems that governed their profession.

But the previous two bodies had also produced documentation, had also been reported through appropriate channels, and the response to those reports had been administrative acknowledgment followed by administrative silence. The findings had been received. The findings had been filed. The findings had disappeared into whatever bureaucratic process handled things that bureaucratic processes preferred not to handle.

"Three bodies," Sigurd said, the words directed at his Säide and the empty morgue and the cold coffee that he hadn't bothered to finish. "Three bodies in ten days, all showing the same impossible pattern, all officially classified as natural causes despite the causes being obviously unnatural to anyone who examines them with even minimal attention. What does that suggest to you?"

His Säide's response was warmth and pressure that translated roughly to *institutional suppression*, which was probably accurate but wasn't particularly helpful in determining what to do about it.

He finished the examination with the thoroughness that the situation required, noting every anomaly and documenting every observation and building a record that would survive whatever administrative processes might attempt to make it disappear. Then he cleaned up, disposed of his examination materials according to proper protocols, and prepared to do what his profession required even when his profession's institutions seemed determined to make the requirement meaningless.

He was going to file a report. He was going to present his findings to the appropriate authorities. He was going to follow the procedures that were supposed to produce investigation and response when investigation and response were warranted.

And when those procedures failed--because he was increasingly certain they would fail, because they had already failed twice before--he was going to keep his own records, maintain his own documentation, build his own archive of evidence that the institution was refusing to see.

Someone was killing people with a mechanism that shouldn't exist. The Academy's administration didn't want to acknowledge that fact. Sigurd wasn't sure yet what that meant or why it was happening or who was responsible, but he was sure that the answer mattered, that the pattern he was seeing wasn't going to stop on its own, that more bodies would arrive in his morgue with the same impossible damage until someone either solved the mystery or became part of it.

His coffee was cold and his morning was ruined and his faith in institutional processes was beginning to erode in ways that twenty years of believing in those processes hadn't prepared him for.

"Interesting," he said again, the word inadequate but accurate. Then he gathered his documentation and went to do what was going to turn out to be a waste of time.

### Scene 2

> *Sigurd -- Academy Administration Wing, Afternoon*

---

The administrator's office was decorated with attention to respectability that administrative professionals cultivated, the walls displaying certifications and commendations and the physical evidence of a career spent advancing through institutional hierarchies in the approved fashion. Administrator Stahl was third-generation Academy, which meant his family had been processing paperwork and managing physicians for longer than most of those physicians had been alive, and his expression when Sigurd entered with his documentation suggested that he recognized trouble when it walked through his door and would have preferred trouble to walk elsewhere.

"Aelfson." Stahl gestured toward the chair opposite his desk, the motion conveying welcome without warmth. "You requested an urgent meeting regarding autopsy findings. I've allocated fifteen minutes."

"The findings require more than fifteen minutes, Administrator, but I'll be as efficient as circumstances permit." Sigurd settled into the chair without relaxing into it, his body maintaining the professional tension that important conversations demanded. "I've conducted examinations on three bodies in the past ten days, all classified as natural Hollowing deaths. None of them are natural. None of them are Hollowing deaths in any conventional sense. Someone is using a mechanism to induce Säide failure artificially, and the mechanism is being deployed deliberately against selected targets."

Stahl's expression shifted through several configurations that Sigurd's medical training allowed him to read: surprise, concern, and then the careful neutrality that administrators developed when they were about to say things they'd rather not have to say. "Those are significant claims, Aelfson. I assume you have documentation to support them?"

"I have extensive documentation." Sigurd placed his files on the desk, the physical evidence of the hours he'd spent building a case that should have been convincing to anyone willing to examine it honestly. "Photographic evidence of tissue damage inconsistent with natural Hollowing. Analysis of the damage patterns showing deliberate rather than random progression. Comparative data from all three cases demonstrating identical mechanisms of Säide destruction. The evidence is clear, Administrator. Someone has developed a way to kill people by weaponizing their own symbiotes against them."

Stahl didn't reach for the files. His hands remained folded on his desk, the posture of someone who had already decided what he was going to say and was merely waiting for an appropriate moment to say it.

"The Academy has received your previous reports on this matter," Stahl said, his voice carrying the tone that meant official position rather than personal opinion. "The findings have been reviewed by appropriate authorities. The conclusion, which I'm authorized to communicate to you directly, is that your observations represent diagnostic error rather than evidence of deliberate harm."

"Diagnostic error." Sigurd felt his Säide pulse warm, the colony responding to the stress that this conversation was generating. "Administrator, I've been conducting autopsies for twenty years. My diagnostic accuracy is documented in Academy records that you can access at any time. I don't make the kind of errors that would produce these findings."

"The documentation you've submitted has been classified as restricted, pending further review." Stahl's expression hadn't changed, the neutral mask remaining firmly in place. "You're instructed to suspend research into this topic until the review is complete. You're further instructed to avoid discussing your preliminary findings with colleagues, students, or anyone outside this office."

"You're telling me to stop investigating murders because the investigation is inconvenient for someone."

"I'm telling you that orders have been received from authorities above my level, and those orders require your cooperation." Something shifted behind Stahl's eyes, something that might have been sympathy or might have been warning or might have been both. "Your position at this Academy is valuable, Aelfson. Your contributions to medical education and research are recognized and appreciated. It would be regrettable if those contributions were interrupted by decisions that conflict with institutional priorities."

The threat was clear enough despite the administrative language it was wrapped in. Sigurd sat with it for a moment, letting his Säide process the stress while his conscious mind processed the implications. The Academy--or someone controlling the Academy--didn't want him investigating these deaths. The cover-up wasn't accidental, wasn't the result of bureaucratic inefficiency or honest disagreement about evidence. The cover-up was deliberate, was policy, was being enforced by threats to his career and possibly more.

"I understand," Sigurd said, the words tasting like betrayal even as he spoke them. "I'll suspend my research pending the review."

"I'm glad we understand each other." Stahl's relief was visible in the slight relaxation of his shoulders, the easing of tension that came from a difficult conversation concluding in the approved fashion. "Your discretion in this matter is appreciated. The Academy's leadership is confident that the review will resolve any remaining questions."

Sigurd gathered his files--the files that Stahl hadn't touched, hadn't examined, hadn't wanted to examine--and rose to leave. At the door, he paused, turning back to face the administrator who had just told him that institutional priorities outweighed dead bodies.

"One question, Administrator. The review you mentioned--how long is it expected to take?"

"As long as necessary." Stahl's expression had returned to its professional neutrality. "These matters require careful consideration. I wouldn't expect conclusions before the situation has... stabilized."

Stabilized. Sigurd filed the word away in the mental archive where he was beginning to keep things that administrators said when they meant something other than what they were saying. The situation would stabilize when whoever was killing people had finished killing people, presumably. The review would conclude when there was nothing left to review.

"Thank you for your time, Administrator."

He left the office with his documentation and his instructions and the growing certainty that following those instructions would make him complicit in whatever was happening. The Academy didn't want him investigating. The appropriate authorities had decided that murdered people were less important than institutional stability. The systems he'd believed in for twenty years were revealing themselves as systems designed to protect their own functioning rather than the people they were supposed to serve.

Back in his office--the small, cluttered space where he'd spent thousands of hours learning and teaching and trying to understand how bodies worked and why they sometimes stopped working--Sigurd sat with his files and his thoughts and the decision that the conversation with Stahl had made unavoidable.

He could follow instructions. He could suspend his research, maintain his position, continue his career in the institution that had given him purpose for two decades. He could trust that the review would eventually produce answers, that the appropriate authorities had reasons for their decisions that he didn't understand but that might prove justified.

Or he could keep working. Keep investigating. Keep building the documentation that would prove what was happening even if the institution didn't want proof. He could risk his position, his career, everything he'd built, for the possibility of understanding something that powerful people clearly didn't want understood.

His Säide pulsed warm, the colony's input arriving without being requested. *What would Aldric have done?* The thought surprised him--he didn't usually think of his mentor by name, didn't usually invoke the memory of the physician who had taught him that medicine was about truth first and institutions second and that the distinction mattered even when the distinction was costly.

Aldric would have kept investigating. Aldric had kept investigating, had followed evidence wherever it led regardless of what institutions wanted, and Aldric had died in an accident that the records called equipment failure but that had always felt too convenient to be coincidental.

Sigurd opened his files and began copying them, creating a duplicate archive that would survive whatever the official review decided to do with the originals. The institution had told him to stop. He was going to stop appearing to investigate while continuing to investigate in ways that the institution wouldn't see until the investigation was complete.

Someone was killing people with weaponized Säide failure. The Academy didn't want that fact acknowledged. Sigurd was going to acknowledge it anyway, whatever the cost.

"Interesting," he murmured, the word that covered everything from intellectual fascination to profound horror. "Let's see where this goes."

### Scene 3

> *Helmar -- Administrative Complex, Senior Office, Same Day*

---

The new office was larger than his previous one, which was the point of promotions in administrative hierarchies--each advancement came with physical markers of status that were supposed to compensate for whatever the advancement actually required of the person receiving it. Helmar sat behind his new desk, in his new chair, surrounded by the filing systems and documentation protocols that his new position involved, and tried to feel something other than the dread that had been accumulating since his dinner with Varkus three nights ago.

The Special Documentation Division handled sensitive files, which was the official description. The unofficial description, which Helmar was beginning to understand through the work that crossed his desk, was that the Special Documentation Division handled files that needed to look different than they actually were. Death certificates that had been revised before filing. Inspection reports that had been edited for "accuracy." Resource allocation documentation that showed approved transfers to facilities that didn't appear in public records.

He processed everything according to procedure, which was what his training demanded and what his new position required. He noted the irregularities with the part of his mind that had always noticed irregularities, the cognitive pattern that his Säide enhanced and that had made him valuable to the institution in the first place. And he filed those irregularities away in the private archive that he'd begun building, the documentation that might matter someday even if it couldn't matter now.

"The Hollowing reports," his assistant said, entering with a stack of paperwork that represented the morning's intake. "Three more from the past week. Same district as the previous cluster. Same preliminary classification."

"Thank you, Marta." Helmar accepted the stack with the professional neutrality that his position required, keeping his expression carefully blank as he examined what he was being given. "I'll process these before the afternoon session."

The reports were identical in the ways that mattered--same language, same structure, same official determination of natural causes, same absence of the details that might allow anyone to question the determination. Someone had developed a template for these deaths, a procedural framework that transformed impossible Hollowing into routine mortality, and Helmar's new position involved ensuring that the template was followed correctly.

He thought about Grigor, about the colleague he'd been instructed to watch, about the questions that Grigor had apparently been asking before Varkus had decided those questions were inconvenient. Grigor was a records clerk, a minor position in the administrative hierarchy, the kind of person who spent his career processing documentation that more senior administrators had already approved. But Grigor had noticed something, had found patterns that he wasn't supposed to find, and now Helmar was supposed to report on whether Grigor's noticing was becoming institutionally problematic.

For the record, Helmar thought, the phrase that had become his internal refrain. For the record: I am processing death certificates that I know are fraudulent. For the record: I am being paid to make murder look like natural causes. For the record: I have agreed to this because I was afraid of what disagreeing might cost me.

His Säide pulsed warm, the colony's cognitive enhancement providing the clarity that made his current situation impossible to ignore. Every file that crossed his desk represented a choice--the choice to process correctly and be complicit, or the choice to question and be at risk. Every signature he added to documentation that he knew was false was another step into the trap that Varkus had designed for him, another layer of guilt that would make it harder to escape if he ever decided escaping was necessary.

The first Hollowing report was straightforward, if fraudulent: a guild official, found dead in his home, preliminary examination showing Säide failure consistent with natural Hollowing. The documentation noted nothing unusual, nothing that would suggest the death required investigation beyond routine processing. Helmar signed it, because signing it was his job, because not signing it would raise questions he wasn't ready to answer.

The second report was similar--another guild official, another natural Hollowing, another file that would flow through the system without generating the scrutiny that scrutiny would reveal was warranted. Helmar signed it, adding his name to the chain of administrative approval that converted possible murder into official mortality statistics.

The third report made him pause.

The name on the documentation was Edvard Magnusson, which wasn't significant by itself. The preliminary classification was industrial accident rather than natural Hollowing, which was different from the other reports but not unusual enough to warrant special attention. What made Helmar pause was the facility listed as the accident site, a processing plant that his previous position had flagged years ago for irregularities in its resource allocation reporting.

He opened his private archive--the notes he'd been keeping since before the promotion, the documentation of patterns that he'd noticed and filed away because noticing was safer than acting on what he'd noticed. The facility appeared three times: once in connection with unusual material shipments, once in connection with a personnel transfer that didn't match standard protocols, and once in connection with a death that had occurred six months before Edvard Magnusson's industrial accident.

The earlier death was Aldric von Felsmark. Helmar's husband. The death certificate that Helmar had processed himself twelve years ago, noting the irregularities, filing correctly, going home to an empty apartment.

For the record, he thought, and the phrase felt different now than it had before. For the record: the facility where my husband died has now killed another inspector. For the record: the system that I serve is the system that murdered Aldric. For the record: I have been processing documentation for that system for twelve years because I was too afraid to see what I was processing.

His hands were steady as he signed Edvard Magnusson's death certificate. His Säide was warm and alert, providing the cognitive clarity that his current situation required. His face showed nothing that an observer would recognize as distress, because administrative professionals learned early that faces were information and information could be used against you.

But somewhere inside the professional compliance that had defined his career, something was shifting. The connection between Aldric's death and Magnusson's death wasn't coincidence--it was pattern, was evidence, was the kind of documentation that Grigor had apparently been building before Varkus had decided that building was dangerous. Helmar had been given this position because he could be trusted to process without questioning. The question now was whether that trust was still accurate, whether the man who had filed his husband's death certificate without investigation was still the man who could file other death certificates without asking what the certificates were concealing.

He finished processing the morning's intake, signed what needed signing, filed what needed filing, performed the role that his position required with the competence that had earned him the position in the first place. Then he returned to his private archive, to the notes that might become evidence if he ever found the courage to make them matter, and added three new entries: the Hollowing reports from today, the connection between facilities, the pattern that was beginning to emerge from the scattered observations he'd been collecting for years.

The system that had killed Aldric was still killing. The documentation that concealed that killing was now passing through Helmar's hands. The choice he'd been avoiding for twelve years--the choice between compliance and conscience, between safety and truth, between the person he'd been and the person he might become--was no longer abstract.

He couldn't undo what he'd already done. But he could start building something different, could document what he was seeing with the precision that his training provided, could create a record that might survive whatever the system decided to do with the people who created inconvenient records.

For the record, he thought, and meant it differently than he'd meant it before.

For the record: I'm starting to keep the real records now.
