### Scene 1

> *Kaisa -- Her Quarters, Sumpward District, Pre-Dawn*

---

The thing about preparing for a surface run was that it became ritual whether you wanted it to or not, each piece of equipment checked and rechecked in the same order every time, hands moving through motions that muscle memory had long since claimed from conscious thought--and Kaisa had stopped trying to pretend she was above the superstition of it, because she'd seen what happened to runners who improvised their prep work, who decided they didn't need the same boring routine they'd followed for the last hundred runs, who got casual about the thing that kept them alive long enough to get casual. Most of them weren't around to regret the decision, which was either a blessing or a tragedy depending on how you felt about the educational value of painful lessons.

Her quarters were Sump-standard--small and slightly damp, carrying that smell that came from living adjacent to the underground's lowest habitable levels, where water seeped through stone carved by hands dead for generations and where the ventilation systems were considerably more theoretical than the people who maintained them liked to admit. Kaisa had grown up with that smell the way she'd grown up with the constant background hum of pump machinery and the flicker of glowstock lighting that never quite managed to be steady. Home. The way anywhere became home if you spent enough years waking up there, even if home was objectively a place that most people spent their lives trying to leave.

The surface suit went on first, always, because the suit was the foundation and everything else built from it--flexible enough to allow movement, rigid enough to protect against the debris that surface work inevitably generated, and treated with compounds that gave sealed Säide their best chance of surviving actinic exposure without sealing dirty. The suit's inner surface was warm against her skin where her own Säide responded to the familiar pressure, the colony's somatic pulse communicating approval of a process it had experienced enough times to anticipate. Reflexive comfort from partnership rather than instruction. Her Säide was Aisti-strain, perception-enhanced, and it had learned long ago that surface runs required the attention that partnership excelled at providing--heightened awareness, sharper pattern recognition, the ability to notice things that other runners missed because noticing things was what kept you alive up top.

Hood next, then gloves, then the tool harness that held the implements she might need during recovery work, each piece checked for function and fit and the absence of the small failures that became large failures when you discovered them in an environment that didn't forgive discovery. Kaisa had learned tool-checking from her mother, who had learned it from her mother, who had learned it from--

She paused, hands still for the first time since she'd started the routine, and let her attention drift to the portrait that hung on the wall beside her sleeping alcove.

Grandmother Solla looked back at her from the frame with the expression that all old portraits seemed to share--that seriousness that came from holding still long enough for an artist to capture something lasting. The portrait was decades old now, painted before Kaisa was born, back when Solla Kalevin was the most accomplished runner Ruinmouth had ever produced--more runs than anyone could verify, more recoveries than anyone could catalog, a reputation that had grown into legend more than history. The seamwork in the portrait was distinctive, almost decorative--patterns that curled and branched across Solla's exposed skin in configurations that looked less like the functional tracery most Säide produced and more like something intentional, aesthetic, as if her colony had been making art rather than merely maintaining symbiosis. No one had ever seen seamwork quite like it before or since, and theories about its origin had become part of the Solla legend: unusual Säide strain, surface adaptation, simple artistic embellishment by the portraitist.

Kaisa had always thought it looked like writing.

Solla had disappeared thirty-two years ago. A run that should have been routine, a sector that had been surveyed dozens of times before, conditions that fell within normal parameters by every measure that mattered. She'd gone up with a crew of six and none of them had come back, and the recovery team that followed had found equipment but no bodies, and the investigation that followed the recovery team had concluded "presumed lost to surface conditions" because that was what investigations concluded when they couldn't find better answers.

Kaisa had been three years old when it happened. She didn't remember her grandmother in any meaningful way--the woman herself had become story long before Kaisa was old enough to form memories that stuck, and the memories she thought she had were probably reconstructions built from the stories her mother had told and the portrait that had always hung in whatever cramped quarters the Kalevin family had occupied at the time. But she remembered the absence, or at least she remembered growing up shaped by it--the knowledge that the surface had taken someone, that the surface could take anyone, that the relationship between the underground and the world above was one of extraction and loss. Grief without a body to mourn.

"Patterns in the ruins," Kaisa said to the portrait, because she'd developed the habit of talking to her grandmother during prep work and had stopped being embarrassed about it somewhere in her mid-twenties. "Like writing. That's what your last transmission said. They filed it under exposure delirium because that's what they file everything under when they don't want to think about it too hard."

The portrait didn't answer, obviously, but Kaisa had learned that the answer wasn't the point. The point was the ritual, the connection, the acknowledgment that she was carrying something into the surface besides equipment and Säide--she was carrying questions, carrying mysteries, carrying the weight of a woman who had noticed something strange in the ruins and had disappeared before she could explain what she'd noticed.

Kaisa's mother had died eight years ago, Säide failure that the writ-doctors called "accumulated strain" and that everyone who knew her understood as "worked herself to death trying to support a family in a sector that didn't pay living wages." Kaisa had inherited the portrait, inherited the mystery, inherited the burden of being the last Kalevin who might ever find out what had happened to Solla up there in the actinic light where Säide went stupid and equipment degraded visibly and the surface did whatever it wanted regardless of what the underground thought about the matter.

"One more run," she told the portrait, finishing her equipment check with the final verification of her breathing apparatus, the filters that would buy her a few extra hours in atmosphere that wasn't quite lethal but wasn't exactly friendly either. "Sector seventeen today. Ruinfield west quadrant. Standard salvage, standard crew, standard everything except the part where nothing about the surface is ever actually standard."

Her Säide pulsed warm, a reminder that the timing of surface runs mattered and that pre-dawn departures meant arriving at optimal light conditions rather than fighting the weird shadows that developed when the actinic intensity peaked and everything up top started looking like it was underwater even when it wasn't. Kaisa acknowledged the reminder with the kind of wordless communication that long partnership made possible, the somatic dialogue that bypassed language entirely because some things didn't need to be spoken to be understood.

She took one last look at the portrait--at the seamwork patterns that had become famous in the decades since their bearer had vanished, at the expression that suggested Solla had known things that she'd never had a chance to explain--and headed for the Yard.

### Scene 2

> *Kaisa -- Surface, Ruinfield Sector, Midday*

---

The surface looked the way the surface always looked, which was wrong in ways that familiarity never quite made comfortable--amber-grey sky that seemed to press down rather than open up, shadows that fell at angles that didn't match any light source visible from where you were standing, and silence that came from being in a place where nothing that should make noise was alive to make it. Kaisa had been running the surface since she was seventeen, twelve years of accumulated exposure and accumulated experience, and she still felt the wrongness every time she climbed through the locks and stood under a sky that her Säide recognized as hostile the way prey recognized predators, instinctively and completely and without requiring thought.

Her Säide had gone quiet the moment they'd breached, the colony's activity dropping to baseline maintenance as it conserved resources against the actinic radiation that made everything up top more expensive in ways that didn't stop at equipment degradation. The light made the knot stupid--that was the runner phrase for it, the acknowledgment that Säide couldn't think clearly when the actinic intensity was doing whatever it did to symbiotic processing, that the partnership you depended on underground became a liability up top if you expected it to perform the way it performed in the tunnels. You learned to work without it, or you didn't learn anything because you didn't survive long enough to develop the understanding.

The crew was six today: Kaisa and four other experienced runners plus a salvage coordinator who stayed at the breach point and managed communications with the Yard, the standard configuration for a sector that had been surveyed enough times to establish reasonable risk parameters. Tomasz led--thirty years of surface work behind him, more seamwork than exposed skin, his exposed forearms a patchwork of healed damage where the Säide had knit flesh back together after every cut and burn and impact that surface work accumulated. The scars layered over each other like sediment, pale against darker skin, a topographical record of three decades of survival that his colony had made possible but never erased. Veteran presence that made everyone else feel slightly safer even when safety was largely theoretical up top. The others were Ruuta, Bren, Eskel, and the coordinator Mira, all of them people Kaisa had worked with before, all of them competent enough to be trusted with surface recovery's demands.

They'd entered through the western approach, avoiding the debris fields that made the northern route slower, and spread into the standard pattern that salvage work demanded--far enough apart to cover ground efficiently, close enough to respond if someone found trouble or trouble found someone. Sector seventeen was familiar territory, a ruinfield that had been picked over many times before but that still yielded useful salvage if you knew where to look and how to extract without triggering the structural failures that old buildings developed when they'd been exposed to actinic weathering for decades. The bones of whatever had stood here before the Scouring were still visible if you looked with the right eyes--walls that had once been walls, foundations that had once supported things worth supporting, the archaeological residue of a civilization that had lived above before living above became a death sentence.

Kaisa worked her way through what had probably been a residential structure, picking through debris that her trained eye sorted automatically into useful and useless categories. Actinic-treated materials--rare, valuable, the kind of salvage that made runs profitable even when everything else came back worthless. Metal components that hadn't degraded past functionality. Occasionally, intact artifacts from the pre-Scouring period that researchers would pay premium prices for, though most of what survived was too damaged to be worth the weight it would cost to carry back.

Her Säide remained quiet, but her own senses--the ones that worked independent of symbiotic enhancement--stayed sharp through the discipline that surface work required, the conscious attention that substituted for the unconscious awareness her Säide provided underground. She noticed the way light fell differently on certain surfaces, noticed the debris patterns that suggested recent structural shifts, noticed the absence of the small signs of life that even ruinfields sometimes displayed when conditions were right for the adapted organisms that had learned to survive where humans couldn't stay.

She also noticed--or thought she noticed--movement at the edge of her vision. A shadow that didn't belong to any structure she could identify, shifting across a debris pile forty meters east with a fluidity that suggested something alive rather than something falling. Her Säide couldn't help her here, couldn't enhance her perception or filter the data the way it would underground, but twelve years of surface work had taught her to trust the instincts that operated beneath conscious thought. Something had moved. Something was watching.

She didn't turn to look directly. Surface protocol: don't engage what you can't understand, don't acknowledge what you can't explain, complete your objective and extract before curiosity became casualty. The shadow didn't move again, or if it did she couldn't detect it against the visual noise of a ruinfield that seemed designed to confuse human perception. But the feeling stayed with her--the crawling awareness of observation, the sense that whatever lived up here had noticed her the same way she'd noticed it.

She noticed, most specifically, that something was wrong with the corpse arrangement in the clearing ahead.

Kaisa stopped, her body going still before her mind had consciously processed what she was looking at, the survival instincts that surface work developed cutting through the normal sequence of perception and analysis. The clearing was maybe thirty meters across, a gap in the ruins where whatever structure had once stood had collapsed completely rather than leaving the partial remnants that surrounded it. The ground was covered in the fine debris that accumulated over time, the dust-like particulate that coated everything up top--and in the center of that debris, arranged with a precision that couldn't have been accidental, lay what remained of runners.

Four bodies. She could tell they were runners by the equipment--degraded surface suits, tool harnesses, the particular configuration of survival gear that marked someone as professionally adapted to working in conditions that killed amateurs. The bodies themselves were beyond identification, exposed to enough actinic weathering that the Säide had long since failed and the flesh had followed: skin turned to something like leather where it hadn't sloughed away entirely, faces collapsed into skulls that still wore expressions of whatever they'd felt in their final moments, fingers curled into claws that had been reaching for something they never grasped. The smell was wrong for decay--actinic exposure did something to organic tissue that wasn't quite decomposition, more like preservation through destruction, cooking the flesh slowly enough that it mummified rather than rotted. Where their Säide had been, she could see the distinctive scarring of symbiotic failure: seamwork that had blackened and curled at the edges, colony tissue that had abandoned its host in the particular pattern of colonies that died before their humans did.

But the arrangement--

The bodies weren't scattered. They weren't positioned the way falls positioned bodies, the way structural collapse distributed remains, the way any natural process she could imagine would leave human corpses in a clearing in the middle of a ruinfield. They were placed. Deliberately, intentionally, with the particular attention to positioning that suggested meaning rather than accident. One at each cardinal direction, arms extended toward the center of the clearing where they almost touched, forming a pattern that looked like--

"Did you see this?" she called out, her voice cutting through the silence with more urgency than she'd intended, the runner training that demanded communication overriding the instinct toward quiet that the surface usually inspired.

Tomasz was closest. He crossed to her position with the economical movement of someone who'd learned long ago not to waste energy up top, and stood beside her looking at the clearing with an expression that shifted from confusion to recognition to something she couldn't quite name.

"Old runs," he said, his voice flat in a way that suggested he was controlling something. "They've been up here for years. Decades, maybe. Longer than I've been coming up."

"They're arranged."

"Could be structural. Building collapse sometimes--"

"Tomasz." Kaisa cut him off because the denial was too obvious, because she'd seen enough structural collapse to know what it looked like, and because whatever was in front of them wasn't the result of any natural process she could identify. "They're arranged. Four bodies, four directions, arms pointing to center. That's not collapse. That's placement."

The veteran runner didn't answer immediately, which was its own kind of answer--the hesitation of someone who didn't want to admit what he was seeing, who preferred the comfortable explanation even when comfort required ignoring evidence. Kaisa had seen that hesitation before, had felt it herself on other runs when the surface presented something that didn't fit the acceptable categories, but she'd also learned that ignoring evidence was a good way to become evidence yourself.

"Document it," Tomasz said finally. "Photography, measurements, everything. But don't touch anything, and don't talk about this with the others until we're back at the Yard."

"What do you think it means?"

"I think the surface has its own rules, and I think some of those rules aren't ones we understand." Tomasz met her eyes, and there was something in his expression that looked like warning and something else that looked like fear--the kind that came from knowing more than you wanted to know. "Document it, Kaisa. Leave the interpretation for later."

She documented. Photography from multiple angles, distance measurements, detailed notes on the positioning and condition of each body, the kind of thorough observation that her Säide would have enhanced underground but that she had to perform through raw attention up top. Her hands were steady as she worked, the routine of documentation providing structure for the part of her mind that wanted to speculate, wanted to theorize, wanted to ask questions that the clearing couldn't answer.

Four runners, arranged like points on a compass. Arms extended toward center, fingertips almost touching. Placed here by something that had the capability and the intention to move bodies into patterns that resembled--

Writing. Patterns in the ruins, like writing.

Her grandmother's last transmission echoed in her memory, the words that had been filed under exposure delirium because nobody wanted to think too hard about what they might mean. Solla had seen something in the surface, something that looked like communication rather than chaos, and now Kaisa was looking at something that looked very much like the same thing thirty-two years later.

She finished her documentation as the others arrived, as the standard responses played out--confusion, denial, the practical questions about recovery and reporting that surface work always generated when something unexpected appeared. Tomasz kept control, kept the crew focused on completing the salvage sweep rather than dwelling on discoveries that couldn't be explained by acceptable answers, and Kaisa watched him managing the situation with the particular skill of someone who'd had practice managing situations that defied management.

The run continued. They collected their salvage, marked their locations, began the careful process of extraction that would return them to the breach point and then to the underground and then to the Yard where someone would have to file reports about what they'd found. Kaisa moved through the routine with the automatic competence that twelve years had developed, but her mind stayed with the clearing, stayed with the bodies, stayed with the pattern that looked too much like meaning to be accident.

She photographed it one more time before they left--the arrangement, the positioning, the geometry that seemed to hold significance even if she couldn't read what it was significant of. Evidence, she told herself. Documentation. The kind of proof that might matter later, when someone finally started asking the questions that everyone had been avoiding.

Her grandmother had seen something. Had reported something. Had disappeared before anyone could decide whether to believe her.

Kaisa wasn't going to disappear. She was going to understand.

### Scene 3

> *Kaisa -- Ruinmouth Yard, Post-Run Debrief*

---

The Yard smelled like decontamination compounds and recycled air and the biological sharpness of Säide reactivating after suppression, colonies waking up to do the repair work that surface exposure always required--and Kaisa had learned to associate that smell with safety, with homecoming, with the transition from a world that wanted to kill you to a world that merely didn't care whether you lived or died, which was a substantial improvement even if it didn't sound like one when you described it in those terms.

The crew had processed through the standard post-run protocols: equipment surrender for inspection and maintenance, biometric verification that everyone who'd gone up had come back down, the preliminary health assessment that would flag anyone whose Säide had sealed dirty or whose exposure metrics suggested monitoring was required. Kaisa's own readings came back within acceptable parameters, her Säide already recovering from the actinic suppression with the efficiency Aisti-strains developed over time, the partnership resuming its normal activity with the quiet competence of a colony that had learned surface work's rhythms as thoroughly as its host had.

The debrief room was standard Yard construction--functional, ugly, built to serve purposes rather than impress visitors. Crew Lead Tomasz sat at the head of the table with the expression of someone who was already planning how to frame his report, while the rest of the team settled into the familiar configuration that debriefs always generated: coordinates documented, salvage inventoried, notable observations recorded for the official files that someone would presumably read at some point if anything ever warranted actual investigation.

Kaisa waited for the bodies to come up, waited for someone to mention the clearing and the arrangement and the evidence that she'd documented with the thorough attention that her training required. The salvage coordinator Mira was reviewing the day's haul, marking items for processing and pricing, her attention focused on the practical outcomes that made runs worth running. The other runners were already thinking about their next assignments, the professional detachment that surface work required making it easy to move from completed operation to upcoming operation without dwelling on the parts that fell outside standard parameters.

The bodies didn't come up.

"Good run overall," Tomasz said, concluding his summary with the tone of someone who was deliberately not saying something. "Salvage values within expectations. No injuries requiring extended care. Route confirmed for future operations." He glanced around the table, his attention passing over Kaisa without pausing. "Questions?"

Kaisa opened her mouth to speak, to ask about the official record, to demand explanation for why the discovery in sector seventeen wasn't being discussed in a debrief that was supposed to cover notable observations--and then she noticed the way Tomasz was looking at her, the slight shake of his head that was too small for the others to catch but clear enough for someone who was watching for it. Later, his expression said. Not here. Not now.

"No questions," she said, the words feeling like compromise in her mouth, like professional silence she'd promised herself she'd never learn to practice. "Good run."

The debrief concluded with the bureaucratic efficiency that Yard operations required, crew members dispersing to their various post-run activities while Kaisa gathered her documentation kit with the deliberate slowness of someone who was waiting to be approached. She didn't have to wait long.

"Walk with me," Tomasz said, appearing beside her as the room emptied, his voice low enough that the words wouldn't carry beyond the two of them. "I need to show you something."

They walked through the Yard's industrial corridors, past the equipment storage where recovered salvage accumulated between processing cycles, past the medical facilities where runners with more serious exposure damage received the care that standard protocols couldn't provide, past the administrative section where people who'd never been up top made decisions about people who went up regularly. Tomasz moved with purpose but without urgency, the stride of someone who knew exactly where he was going and didn't want to attract attention by appearing to rush.

He led her to a private storage alcove, a space that looked like it had been claimed informally by someone with enough seniority to claim things, and pulled a document case from a shelf that held nothing else. The case was old, the material showing the kind of wear that came from decades of handling, and when he opened it Kaisa saw photographs--dozens of them, organized by date, each one showing something that looked very much like what she'd documented in sector seventeen.

"Other clearings," she said, understanding arriving before she could articulate the questions it generated. "Other arrangements. You've seen this before."

"I've seen it seventeen times in thirty years of running." Tomasz spread the photographs across the available surface, the images forming a catalog of discoveries that should have been remarkable and had apparently been filed under things-we-don't-discuss. "Different sectors, different configurations, always bodies, always positioned like they meant something. I started documenting after the third time, when I realized nobody was going to investigate even when I reported it."

"Why didn't you say anything? In the debrief, in official reports, in--"

"I did say something." Tomasz's voice was flat with bitterness--the kind that came from having tried and failed enough times to stop expecting success. "The first few times, I filed complete reports with all the documentation and all the observations and all the questions that seemed obvious to anyone who was actually looking at the evidence. You know what happened? Nothing. Reports filed, reports acknowledged, reports disappeared into whatever administrative hole swallows things that people don't want to think about."

Kaisa looked at the photographs, at the patterns that repeated across images spanning decades, at the evidence of something that had been happening on the surface for longer than she'd been alive. Bodies arranged in configurations that suggested meaning, that suggested communication, that suggested intelligence operating according to rules that underground civilization didn't understand or didn't want to understand.

"Someone's doing this," she said. "Something. Placing bodies, arranging them, leaving messages that we can't--"

"Or won't," Tomasz interrupted. "Can't and won't aren't the same thing, and I stopped being sure which one applied somewhere around the tenth discovery. The surface has always been strange, always had rules we don't understand, always produced evidence that doesn't fit the comfortable stories we tell ourselves about what's up there. Maybe there's nothing to understand. Maybe it's all random pattern-seeking, our minds finding meaning in chaos because meaning is easier than admitting we don't know anything."

"You don't believe that."

"No." Tomasz met her eyes, and there was something in his expression that looked like exhaustion--the kind that came from knowing too much and being able to do too little about it. "I don't believe that. I believe something on the surface is intelligent, organized, and trying to communicate through the only medium it has available--the bodies we leave up there when things go wrong. I believe it's been doing this for decades, maybe longer. And I believe nobody in a position to do anything about it wants to believe what I believe, because believing it would require acknowledging that the surface isn't just hostile territory to be exploited. It would require acknowledging that something up there is watching us."

The photographs lay between them like exhibits in a trial that nobody was going to conduct, evidence of something that should have mattered and apparently didn't. Kaisa thought about her grandmother, about the last transmission that had been filed under exposure delirium, about the patterns in the ruins that Solla had seen and reported and been ignored for seeing.

"My grandmother noticed this," she said. "Thirty-two years ago. Patterns in the ruins, like writing. That's what she transmitted before she disappeared."

Tomasz's expression shifted--recognition, maybe, or surprise, or the attention that came from hearing information that connected to information you already had. "Solla Kalevin. I knew her, back when. Best runner I ever worked with, before or since. When she disappeared, I was on the recovery team that went looking."

"You never found bodies."

"We never found bodies." Tomasz gathered the photographs slowly, returning them to the case with the care of someone handling evidence that might matter someday. "We found equipment, personal effects, signs that the crew had been in the sector when they stopped transmitting. But no bodies. No remains. No explanation for how six experienced runners vanished without leaving any trace that could be recovered."

Kaisa felt her Säide pulse warm, the colony responding to the stress that this conversation was generating, the sympathetic awareness that partnership provided even when the content of the stress couldn't be shared. "What do you think happened to them?"

"I think something took them." Tomasz closed the case, his expression settling into the professional neutrality that thirty years of surface work had developed, the ability to discuss impossible things as if they were merely improbable. "I think whatever's been arranging bodies in the ruins for decades decided to do something different with your grandmother's crew. I don't know what, or why, and I stopped trying to find out when it became clear that finding out might require going places that I couldn't come back from."

"But you kept documenting."

"I kept documenting because documentation is what I can do. Maybe someday someone will take it seriously. Maybe someday someone will have the resources and the authority and the willingness to actually investigate what's happening up there." He handed her the case, the transfer feeling like something more significant than the physical weight of old photographs suggested. "Maybe that someone will be you."

Kaisa took the case, held it, felt the weight of thirty years of observations that nobody had wanted to see. "What am I supposed to do with this?"

"Whatever you think is right." Tomasz moved toward the alcove's exit, the conversation apparently concluded from his perspective. "But if you're going to look into this--if you're going to dig into whatever happened to your grandmother and whatever's been arranging bodies up top for longer than either of us has been running--then do it carefully. Because someone or something doesn't want these questions asked, and people who ask questions that someone doesn't want asked have a way of disappearing."

He paused at the threshold, looking back at her with an expression that combined warning and something that might have been hope.

"I've seen it too," he said. "Don't look too close. You won't like what looks back."

Then he was gone, leaving Kaisa alone with the documentation case and the photographs and the questions that had been accumulating since her grandmother disappeared into a surface that apparently held more intelligence than anyone wanted to admit.

She opened the case again, spread the photographs across the alcove's limited workspace, studied the patterns with attention her Säide was beginning to enhance now that she was back underground and the partnership was functioning normally. The arrangements weren't random--she could see that clearly now, could see the consistency that connected images spanning decades, could see the evidence of intentional design that someone had been creating and leaving for anyone with eyes to notice.

Messages. Communication. Something trying to be understood by beings that didn't want to understand it.

Her grandmother had noticed. Had reported. Had disappeared.

Kaisa wasn't going to disappear. She was going to document, observe, accumulate understanding the way she'd been trained to accumulate understanding--through patient attention, through careful recording, through the stubbornness that surface work developed in people who survived long enough to develop anything.

And someday, when she understood enough to know what questions to ask and who to ask them of, she was going to find out what had happened to Solla Kalevin and what had been trying to communicate through the ruins for longer than anyone wanted to admit.

The surface had its own rules. Maybe it was time someone started learning them.

### Chapter Notes

**Seeds Planted**:
- Grandmother Solla's disappearance 32 years ago, "patterns in the ruins, like writing"
- Bodies arranged in patterns on surface (17 documented instances over 30 years)
- Surface creatures implied to be intelligent, organized, attempting communication
- Institutional suppression of surface anomaly reports
- Kaisa inherits documentation case, becomes keeper of accumulated evidence

**Sensory Immersion**:
- Sump quarters (damp, cramped, pump machinery hum, flickering glowstock)
- Surface wrongness (amber-grey sky, wrong shadows, oppressive silence, actinic pressure)
- Säide going quiet during surface exposure ("the light makes the knot stupid")
- Yard decontamination smells (compounds, recycled air, reactivating Säide)

**Dark Humor Beats**:
- "Got casual about the thing that kept them alive... Most of them weren't around to regret the decision"
- "Home, in the way that anywhere became home if you spent enough years waking up there, even if home was objectively a place that most people spent their lives trying to leave"
- "A world that merely didn't care whether you lived or died, which was a substantial improvement even if it didn't sound like one"
- Administrative hole that "swallows things that people don't want to think about"

**Character Voice Achieved**:
- Kaisa: Pattern recognition, linguistic framing, observation-as-processing
- Filters through survival assessment and communication analysis
- Compares contexts instinctively (surface rules vs. underground rules)
- Ritual and documentation as coping mechanisms

**Thematic Setup**:
- Communication across species/understanding barriers
- Institutional blindness to inconvenient evidence
- Family mystery as entry point to larger conspiracy
- The surface as parallel threat to the political violence below

**Word Count**: ~4,800
