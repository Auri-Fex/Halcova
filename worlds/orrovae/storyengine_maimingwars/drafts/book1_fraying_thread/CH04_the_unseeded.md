### Scene 1

> *Eneko -- Vabakoda Enclave, Communal Hall, Morning*

---

The Communal Hall had been a textile processing facility before the Unseeded claimed it, which meant the architecture was designed for machines rather than people--high ceilings that made voices echo strangely, support columns positioned at intervals that made direct sight lines difficult to establish, and that industrial quality of spaces built to serve purposes that had nothing to do with human comfort. Eneko had spent forty years learning to work with the hall's limitations rather than against them, discovering the positions from which sound carried best and the angles that let him address the largest possible portion of a crowd without turning his back on anyone, and he'd mostly stopped noticing the way the space fought his purposes except on days like today, when his purposes required the kind of attention that the space seemed determined to fragment.

The morning assembly had drawn perhaps three hundred residents--a significant turnout for a routine community address, which suggested that people had heard rumors about what Eneko intended to discuss and wanted to hear the official version before the unofficial versions had time to multiply and mutate the way rumors always did in enclosed communities where information was currency and interpretation was investment. Eneko stood at the speaker's position his predecessors had established generations ago, a slightly raised platform that gave him visibility without creating too much distance, the kind of elevation that said "I speak for you" rather than "I speak down to you."

He was sixty-one years old, which meant he was older than most of the people looking at him but not yet old enough to dismiss, not yet old enough to be treated as a relic whose opinions were interesting but irrelevant. His body showed the wear that sixty-one years accumulated without Säide to smooth over the damage--the lines in his face were genuine age rather than seamwork patterns, the grey in his hair was actual grey rather than pigment drift from colony activity, and the slight stiffness in his joints came from joints that had been working for six decades without regenerative support. The Unseeded aged differently than the Seeded, and Eneko had learned to treat that difference as dignity rather than disadvantage, evidence that he'd earned his years rather than having them maintained for him by a partner he'd never chosen.

"Thank you for coming," he said, letting his voice find the pitch that the hall carried best, the one that his predecessors had documented and his experience had confirmed. "I know there are rumors circulating, and I know those rumors have generated concern, and I thought it would be better to address that concern directly rather than let speculation do the work that honest conversation should do."

The crowd shifted, restless with wanting information and impatient to receive it. Eneko had learned long ago that patience was the speaker's responsibility, not the audience's--you earned their attention by respecting it, by delivering what they came for without making them wait longer than necessary.

"Three days ago, Mira Kõiv's daughter Kati--seven years old, a child who likes to draw pictures of the surface she's never seen--was refused treatment at the Midworks emergency facility. Kati had fallen during play, and her arm was bent at an angle that arms are not supposed to bend. The bone was visible through the skin. She was crying, and Mira was carrying her, and the facility administrator looked at them both and said that the child's 'unseeded status creates complications for standard Säide-assisted treatment protocols.'" Eneko let the words sit for a moment, let the crowd absorb what he was telling them. "Kati sat in that waiting area for forty minutes while her mother argued with administrators who kept consulting regulations. Forty minutes with bone pushing through skin. Forty minutes while adults with the authority to help chose instead to explain why helping would be procedurally difficult. The treatment required was setting and immobilization--procedures that every human civilization has been performing since before the Scouring, since before Säide existed, since before any of the complications the facility cited were relevant to anything."

Murmurs now, the sound of three hundred people processing information that confirmed what many of them had suspected but hadn't wanted to believe. Eneko had seen this reaction before, had learned to recognize the anger that emerged when people discovered that the discrimination they'd been told was improving had actually been getting worse.

"Mira brought Kati home, and Healer Rebane set the arm as competently as any facility would have--though by then the bone had been displaced for nearly two hours, and Rebane had to re-break it before she could set it properly. Kati screamed. Her mother held her down. Rebane did what she had to do because nobody else would." Eneko kept his voice steady, though the anger beneath it was audible to anyone listening for it. "The child is recovering. She'll have a scar where the bone came through, a permanent reminder of the day she learned that her community's existence was considered a procedural complication. The immediate crisis is resolved." He paused, choosing his next words with the care that his position required. "The immediate crisis is resolved, but the pattern the crisis reveals is not. This is the fourth treatment refusal we've documented in the past six weeks. The sixth harassment incident at external workplaces. The eleventh complaint filed with the Hold authority that has received no response."

"What are we going to do about it?" someone called from the middle of the crowd--Kalev, if Eneko identified the voice correctly, one of the younger men who'd been vocal about the enclave's approach to external relations for as long as he'd been old enough to have opinions about approaches.

"That's exactly what I want to discuss." Eneko stepped slightly to the side, changing his position in a way that shifted the crowd's attention and reminded them that this was conversation rather than lecture. "There are, as I see it, three basic approaches available to us, and each of them has costs that we need to understand before we commit to any of them."

He held up one finger, the gesture simple but effective in a space where visual communication helped reinforce verbal content. "First: continued patience. We document every incident, file every complaint, maintain our record of discrimination and harassment, and wait for the Hold authority to recognize that their own policies require them to act. This is what we've been doing. This is what we've been doing for my entire life, and for my predecessor's life before me, and for generations before that. The advantage of this approach is that it maintains our moral position--we are the injured party, we are the ones being reasonable, and any escalation comes from the other side."

"The disadvantage," Kalev called out, not waiting for permission to speak, "is that moral position doesn't fix broken arms. Moral position doesn't keep our children safe when they leave the enclave."

"That's correct." Eneko acknowledged the interruption without either endorsing or dismissing it, the technique he'd developed for handling passionate contributions without derailing the conversation he was trying to facilitate. "Continued patience requires us to accept ongoing harm in exchange for eventual justice that may or may not arrive. That's a real cost, and I won't pretend otherwise."

Second finger. "Second approach: isolation. We minimize contact with the seeded population, reduce our economic integration, become more self-sufficient and less dependent on external services that can be denied to us. Some enclaves have taken this path. They survive, but they survive at a lower standard of living and with less influence over the external conditions that affect them."

"We tried that," said Anu Sepp from her position near the front of the crowd, her voice carrying the authority of the Elder position and the weight of her seventy-three years. "My grandmother tried that, after the Consolidation Riots. Closed the doors, turned inward, waited for the danger to pass. You know what happened? The danger didn't pass. The danger grew, because people outside forgot we existed, and people who forgot we existed stopped caring whether we survived. Isolation is slow extinction."

"Elder Sepp is correct." Eneko nodded toward her, acknowledging both the contribution and the historical context it invoked. "Isolation reduces immediate risk but increases long-term vulnerability. A community that doesn't engage with the world around it becomes easy to ignore, and communities that are easy to ignore become easy to eliminate when elimination becomes convenient."

Third finger. "Third approach: resistance. Active opposition to discrimination and harassment. Protests, demonstrations, legal challenges, political organization with allied movements. This approach has the advantage of visibility--it forces the seeded population to acknowledge us, forces the Hold authority to respond to our demands rather than merely filing them."

"And the disadvantage?" This was Piret Võsa, the Youth representative, her voice carrying the intensity Eneko associated with people who hadn't yet learned how much energy idealism cost.

"The disadvantage is that visibility attracts attention, and attention attracts backlash, and backlash against a minority population without Säide protection tends to be considerably more dangerous than backlash against populations that can regenerate from injury." Eneko let that sink in, let the crowd understand that he wasn't advocating for any particular position but trying to ensure they understood the options they were choosing between. "Resistance requires us to accept the possibility that some of us will be hurt, possibly killed, in exchange for the chance that our situation will improve rather than continue to deteriorate."

The hall was quiet now, the murmurs subsided into the silence of people thinking seriously about serious things. Eneko had learned that this silence was valuable, that it meant the conversation was working, that people were engaging with the complexity rather than retreating into simple answers that felt good but accomplished nothing.

"I'm not going to tell you which approach is correct," he said. "I'm the Spokesman, not the Decider. My job is to represent this community's will, not to impose my own. What I am going to tell you is that we need to choose deliberately, collectively, with full understanding of what each choice costs and what it offers. We need to stop reacting to incidents as they occur and start deciding what kind of community we want to be."

"What about alliance?" This was a new voice, one Eneko didn't immediately recognize--a younger woman near the back of the crowd, her face partially obscured by the support column she was standing near. "You mentioned allied movements. Are there seeded people who would stand with us?"

"Some." Eneko turned toward the new speaker, acknowledging the question as worthy of serious response. "There are reform movements within the seeded population that advocate for Unseeded rights, primarily on philosophical grounds--they believe the current treatment of our community violates principles they hold important. Their support is genuine but limited. They can't protect us from violence. They can only argue against it."

"Better than nothing," the woman said.

"Better than nothing," Eneko agreed. "But not as much better as we might hope. When crisis comes--and crisis always comes, eventually--allies who can only argue are allies who cannot shield us from the people who have stopped listening to arguments."

The assembly continued for another hour, voices emerging from different parts of the crowd to contribute perspective and opinion and passionate argument that tight-knit communities generated when they faced external threats together. Eneko guided without directing, facilitated without controlling, and watched his people work through the fear and anger that the recent incidents had awakened.

They didn't reach a decision. He hadn't expected them to reach a decision--real decisions required more than a single morning's conversation, required smaller gatherings and focused discussions and the slow accumulation of consensus that democratic communities built one conversation at a time. But they'd begun the process, and beginning was what mattered.

After the assembly dispersed, Eneko remained in the hall for a time, alone with the echoes of departed voices and the quiet that industrial spaces developed when the people who'd filled them returned to their lives. He thought about his daughter, who'd married a seeded man fifteen years ago and moved to Midworks, who sent occasional letters but rarely visited, who'd chosen her path and deserved the respect of having that choice honored even when the path led away from everything Eneko valued. He thought about his grandson, whom he'd met exactly twice, who was growing up seeded and would probably never understand why his grandfather lived in a sealed enclave and refused the partnership that everyone else accepted as natural.

He thought about the woman who'd asked about alliance, about the hope in her voice and the fear beneath the hope, about the way young people reached for possibility even when possibility seemed distant.

And he thought about the reports he'd been reading for months now, reports from contacts outside the enclave about unusual deaths among seeded officials, about patterns that didn't match natural causes, about something moving beneath the surface of ordinary politics that seemed larger and more dangerous than the routine discrimination his people faced.

The Unseeded were caught between. They always had been--too small to matter in the conflicts of the powerful, too visible to escape the consequences when those conflicts turned violent. Whatever was happening in the seeded population, whatever pattern was emerging in those suspicious deaths and those unusual reports, Eneko suspected his community would be affected whether they chose to engage with it or not.

The question was whether they would be victims or participants.

### Scene 2

> *Eneko -- Private Quarters, Vabakoda, Night*

---

The quarters Eneko had occupied for thirty-seven years were smaller than the ones he'd grown up in, which was the expected trajectory for community leaders who prioritized the needs of young families over the comfort of individuals who no longer required space for children or the accumulation of material goods that larger living suggested. His rooms consisted of a sleeping alcove, a sitting area that doubled as his workspace, and a small private sanitation facility that was a luxury by enclave standards--and he'd spent enough years in these spaces that they'd shaped themselves around his habits, the furniture positioned where he needed it, the storage organized according to patterns that made sense to him and would probably confuse anyone else.

The night had settled into its middle hours, the artificial lighting dimmed to the levels that encouraged sleep in a community where natural light cycles had no meaning and the body had to be trained to rest by environmental cues rather than biological instincts. Eneko should have been sleeping--the assembly had been exhausting, the conversations afterward had been more exhausting, and his body was sixty-one years old and increasingly insistent about its requirements for recovery time. But sleep wasn't coming, hadn't been coming consistently for weeks now, and he'd learned long ago that fighting sleeplessness accomplished nothing except making the next day harder than it needed to be.

Instead, he sat at his workspace with the texts he'd inherited from predecessors who'd inherited them from their predecessors, the accumulated wisdom of generations of Unseeded leaders who'd faced similar challenges and left records of how they'd responded. Most of the collection was practical--diplomatic correspondence, negotiation strategies, documentation of incidents and their resolutions--but there was another section, older and more fragile, that dealt with questions larger than tactics.

The book in front of him was pre-Scouring, or at least claimed to be--a copy of a copy of a copy, transcribed by hand across generations, preserved because someone believed its contents mattered even if nobody could verify whether the contents were accurate anymore. The binding was enclave-made, relatively recent, but the text inside had the particular quality that very old writing developed, the sense that whoever had first composed these words had lived in a world so different from the current one that translation was required even when the language appeared to be the same.

The text described a world with open sky--not the poisoned ceiling of actinic radiation that existed now, but genuine atmosphere, clouds that moved with wind rather than toxic spore patterns, a sun that warmed skin rather than burning it to cancer within minutes of exposure. It described cities on the surface, not warrens carved into stone, and travel between places without sealed transit corridors or decontamination protocols. It described the Säide as rare, precious, a partnership that some people sought and others declined, rather than the universal necessity they'd become.

*In the time before division*, the text read, *there was no above and below. The sun gave light without poison, and the partnership between human and symbiote was a choice rather than a requirement for survival. Some bonded. Some did not. Neither was considered lesser, because neither was considered necessary.*

Eneko had read these words hundreds of times, had memorized them in the way that important texts became memorized through repetition and reflection, had thought about what they might mean for people living in circumstances so different from the ones the original author had known. The pre-Scouring world was legendary, mythological, a story that might have been history but might equally have been wishful reconstruction of a past that had never quite existed as people remembered it. The Unseeded clung to these texts because the texts suggested that their way of living was original, was natural, was the default from which the seeded population had deviated rather than an aberration from which they needed to be corrected.

He turned pages carefully, the paper fragile enough that rough handling would destroy it, until he reached the passage he'd been thinking about during the assembly, the one that seemed to speak to the moment his community was facing.

*The surface will return to us, or we to it. This division cannot last forever. What was sundered will be rejoined, whether by choice or by necessity, whether through wisdom or through catastrophe. The question is not whether reunion will come, but whether we will be ready to survive it when it does.*

The words were ambiguous, as old prophetic texts tended to be--capable of meaning almost anything, depending on how you chose to interpret them. Some Unseeded scholars read "the surface will return to us" as a prediction of environmental change, the hope that someday the actinic radiation would fade and humans could reclaim the world above. Others read it as metaphor, suggesting that the divisions between seeded and unseeded, between upper tier and lower tier, between all the stratifications that underground society had developed, would eventually collapse and something new would emerge from the wreckage.

Eneko read it differently. He read it as warning.

*The question is not whether reunion will come, but whether we will be ready to survive it.*

Something was changing. He felt it in the reports that crossed his desk, in the patterns that his contacts described, in the subtle shifts in how the seeded population treated the Unseeded community. The harassment wasn't new, but the quality of it was different--more systematic, more coordinated, as if directed rather than spontaneous. The suspicious deaths weren't affecting the Unseeded directly, but they were affecting the political structures that the Unseeded depended on, removing people who had been neutral or sympathetic and replacing them with people who were neither.

He'd been trying to understand the pattern for months, and the pattern kept slipping away from him, visible from certain angles and invisible from others, suggesting something larger without revealing what that something was. It reminded him of the way currents worked in the air circulation systems--you couldn't see the air moving, but you could see the effects of the movement, the way dust accumulated in certain places and cleared from others, the evidence of force that the force itself was too subtle to observe directly.

The Unseeded were going to be affected by whatever was happening. That much was certain. They were too vulnerable not to be affected, too visible to be overlooked, too useful as scapegoats or pawns or examples for whatever purpose the changing situation would serve. The question was whether Eneko could figure out what was happening quickly enough to prepare his people, to position them for survival rather than sacrifice.

He turned to another text, this one more recent--his own journal, the daily records he'd been keeping for forty years, the documentation of incidents and observations and thoughts that seemed potentially important even when he couldn't articulate why. The habit had started as discipline and become necessary, a way of tracking patterns that were too slow to see in individual moments but became visible when examined across time.

The entry from two weeks ago caught his attention:

*Varkus from Resource Administration contacted me today. Friendly meeting, he claimed--just checking in on Vabakoda's needs, making sure we're receiving our allocated support. I don't believe him. Varkus has never contacted me without wanting something, and he didn't ask for anything specific, which means he was gathering information rather than seeking exchange. What does Resource Administration want to know about Vabakoda that they can't get from official records?*

And from a week later:

*Three of my external contacts have gone silent. Not hostile, not refusing communication--just silent. Not responding to messages, not appearing at the places where we usually meet. Could be coincidence. Could be that they're busy with their own concerns. But three at once, in a single week, feels like pattern rather than probability.*

And from yesterday:

*The woman at the assembly who asked about alliance. I finally identified her--Ester, new arrival three months ago, claims to be Widowed from Upper Midworks. Her story checks out, but something about her questions felt wrong. Not hostile exactly. Probing. Like she was testing the community's positions rather than genuinely curious about them.*

Eneko closed the journal and sat for a long moment in the dim light, thinking about patterns and connections and the difficulty of understanding situations that you weren't supposed to understand. He was a diplomat, trained in negotiation and representation and the art of finding common ground between opposing positions. He wasn't trained in conspiracy, wasn't equipped for the kind of investigation that the current situation seemed to require.

But he was Unseeded, which meant he'd spent his entire life navigating a world that wasn't designed for people like him, that actively resisted his presence and his community's existence. Maybe that experience would be useful. Maybe the skills he'd developed for surviving as a minority would transfer to surviving whatever was emerging in the seeded population's political structures.

Or maybe he was an old man seeing patterns where none existed, connecting coincidences because connection was more comfortable than randomness, finding conspiracy in situations that had simpler explanations.

The pre-Scouring text sat open on his desk, the words about reunion and survival waiting for him to decide what they meant.

*The surface will return to us, or we to it.*

Eneko didn't know what that meant. But he suspected he was going to find out, whether he was ready or not.

He closed the book, carefully, preserving pages that might or might not contain wisdom that might or might not be relevant to the challenges ahead. Then he turned to his journal and began writing the observations from today's assembly, documenting the voices and positions and undercurrents that he'd noticed, adding to the record that might someday help someone understand what had happened and why.

Documentation was what he could do. It was what the Unseeded had always done--recorded, remembered, preserved the truth in communities where the truth was frequently inconvenient for the people with power to acknowledge. If the pattern he was sensing was real, if something was changing in ways that would affect his people, then the record of that change would matter. Someone would need to know. Someone would need to understand.

And if he was wrong--if the pattern was imagination and the connections were coincidence and the changes he thought he was sensing were nothing more than the ordinary fluctuations of a political system that had never been stable--then the documentation would at least prove that he'd been paying attention. That he'd tried to understand. That he'd done what his position required even when his understanding fell short of the situation's demands.

Outside his quarters, the enclave settled into its night routine--the hum of air filtration systems maintaining the barrier between Unseeded space and the spore-saturated atmosphere beyond, the quiet movements of the night watch making their rounds, the silence that eight thousand people generated when most of them were sleeping. His people, his responsibility, his community that depended on him to speak for them even when he didn't know what speaking would accomplish.

Tomorrow he would continue the conversations that the assembly had started, would guide the community toward decisions that would shape their future, would try to prepare them for changes he couldn't quite articulate. Tonight, he would write, and think, and wonder whether the texts his predecessors had preserved contained warnings that he was only now beginning to understand.

*What was sundered will be rejoined, whether by choice or by necessity.*

Eneko hoped it would be by choice. He feared it would be by necessity.

He wrote until his eyes refused to focus anymore, then closed his journal and prepared for whatever sleep his body would grant him.
