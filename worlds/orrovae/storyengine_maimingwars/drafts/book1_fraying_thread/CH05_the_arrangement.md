### Scene 1

> *Helmar -- Guild Restaurant, Midworks District, Evening*

---

The restaurant was called The Balanced Ledger, which was either a deeply unfortunate choice of name for an establishment that catered to administrative professionals or a remarkably astute one, depending on how you felt about the people who spent their careers ensuring that numbers added up correctly even when the things being numbered were better left uncounted. Helmar had been eating here for twenty-three years, ever since his first promotion had elevated him into the tier of bureaucratic significance that warranted expense-account dining, and he'd never quite decided which interpretation the original proprietor had intended--though he suspected the ambiguity was deliberate, because ambiguity was what administrative professionals were trained to appreciate in the same way that soldiers were trained to appreciate clear lines of fire.

The booth Varkus had reserved was in the back, naturally, positioned for privacy in the way that important conversations always seemed to require positioning, the table set with attention to detail that the Ledger's staff had learned their clientele expected. Helmar had arrived exactly on time, which was early by social convention but appropriate by professional standard, and had been waiting for approximately three minutes when Varkus appeared with the measured stride of a man who understood that making subordinates wait was a form of communication and that arriving precisely when expected was its own kind of message.

"Helmar." Varkus settled into the opposite seat with the ease of someone who'd been settling into expensive restaurant booths for considerably longer than Helmar had, his administrative robes arranged with the kind of casual precision that suggested either excellent tailoring or excellent practice at appearing excellently tailored. "Thank you for meeting me. I know your schedule is demanding."

"Supervisor." Helmar inclined his head in the gesture that protocol required, the acknowledgment of hierarchy that administrative culture had refined into an art form. "I appreciate the invitation."

What he didn't say, because saying it would have been inappropriate even if thinking it was unavoidable, was that invitations from supervisors were not things one appreciated so much as things one accepted with appropriate expressions of appreciation regardless of whether appreciation was what one actually felt. Varkus had been his supervisor for eleven years, and in those eleven years Helmar had learned that invitations to dinner meant either rewards or requirements, and that the distinction between the two was often less clear than people outside administrative culture imagined.

The server appeared with menus and water and professional invisibility that high-end service establishments cultivated, taking drink orders and disappearing with the efficiency of someone who understood that customers at this establishment were paying for privacy as much as food. Helmar ordered conservatively--a modest wine, an entrée that fell in the middle of the price range--while Varkus ordered with the confident expansiveness of someone spending someone else's money, which was technically accurate since expense accounts were ultimately taxpayer-funded but which still managed to feel like a statement about relative position.

"I've been reviewing your performance metrics," Varkus said once the server had retreated beyond conversational range, his tone shifting from social pleasantry to professional assessment with the smoothness that long practice provided. "Impressive, as always. Your documentation accuracy is the highest in the department. Your processing speed is in the top percentile. Your compliance with procedural requirements is, frankly, exemplary."

"Thank you, Supervisor." Helmar accepted the praise with the appropriate humility, wondering what the praise was positioning him for. In his experience, supervisors didn't compliment performance unless they wanted something that required the recipient to feel valued before being asked to provide it.

"There's an opening." Varkus paused for effect, the technique that speakers used when they wanted their audience to recognize the significance of what was about to be said. "Senior Administrator, Special Documentation Division. You're aware of the position?"

Helmar was aware of the position. Everyone in the department was aware of the position, because the Special Documentation Division handled the files that regular divisions weren't authorized to see, the paperwork that required elevated clearance and specialized procedures and the discretion that administrative culture valued above almost everything else. The position paid well--though "well" in administrative terms meant approximately twelve percent more than his current salary in exchange for approximately four hundred percent more responsibility, which was the kind of math that only made sense to people who valued prestige in currencies that couldn't be spent on food or housing. The position carried prestige. The position was, by every measure that mattered in the bureaucratic hierarchy, a significant advancement from Helmar's current role.

"I'm aware," he said carefully, because careful was what this conversation seemed to require.

"I've recommended you for consideration." Varkus smiled, the expression that successful administrators developed for moments when they were offering things that recipients were expected to want. "The committee has agreed with my assessment. The position is yours, pending final confirmation."

"I'm honored." The words came automatically, the response that protocol dictated regardless of what Helmar actually felt, which at the moment was something closer to wariness than honor. Promotions in administrative hierarchies came with expectations, and expectations from supervisors like Varkus came with implications that weren't always spelled out in the official documentation.

"The position involves certain... sensitivities." Varkus's voice had dropped slightly, the tonal shift that indicated they were moving from official conversation to unofficial understanding. "Documentation that requires careful handling. Files that flow through particular channels for particular reasons. You understand."

"I understand that sensitive documentation requires appropriate procedures."

"Of course. Of course." Varkus nodded as if Helmar had said exactly the right thing, which he probably had, because administrative culture rewarded the ability to communicate understanding without explicitly stating what was being understood. "The procedures are well-established. The position primarily involves ensuring that files flow smoothly through those procedures. That documentation arrives where it needs to arrive, leaves where it needs to leave, and that the records reflect what the records need to reflect."

Helmar felt his Säide pulse, the colony's warmth intensifying slightly in response to the stress that his conscious mind hadn't yet fully acknowledged. His Säide was Äly-strain, cognitive-enhancement, which meant it was exceptionally good at processing information and exceptionally sensitive to situations where information was being presented in ways designed to obscure rather than illuminate. The pulsing was warning, the symbiotic equivalent of a raised eyebrow, the suggestion that what was being said deserved more attention than casual acceptance would provide.

"The records reflect what the records need to reflect," Helmar repeated, making the words a question without technically making them a question, inviting clarification without demanding it.

"Documentation is a service profession." Varkus's smile hadn't changed, but something behind it had--a hardening, perhaps, or simply the revelation of hardness that had always been present beneath the professional pleasantry. "We serve the institutions we work for. We ensure that institutional needs are met. Sometimes institutional needs involve documentation that arrives in certain forms and departs in certain other forms, and the difference between arrival and departure is what administrative professionals are paid to manage."

For the record, Helmar thought, the phrase that had become reflex after thirty years of documentation work. For the record: my supervisor has just told me that my promotion is contingent on my willingness to alter files. For the record: he has phrased this offer in language designed to provide deniability while ensuring comprehension. For the record: I am expected to agree without asking what files, what alterations, what purposes the altered files will serve.

He thought about refusing. He thought about asking the questions that the conversation was designed to prevent, demanding specifics that would force Varkus to either commit to explicit instruction or retreat from implicit expectation. He thought about his thirty years of service, his reputation for accuracy, his pride in being someone who could be trusted with documentation that mattered.

He thought about his husband Aldric, who had died twelve years ago in an industrial accident that the official documentation had called "equipment failure" and that Helmar had always suspected was something else entirely. Aldric had been asking questions before he died--questions about material shipments, about facility operations, about discrepancies between what the records showed and what his inspections revealed. Aldric had been a quality inspector who took quality seriously, and quality inspectors who took quality seriously sometimes discovered things that other people would have preferred remained undiscovered.

Helmar had processed Aldric's death certificate himself. Had noted the irregularities in the facility's safety records. Had filed the documentation correctly, per standard procedure, and had gone home to an empty apartment and had not asked questions for twelve years because asking questions had not brought Aldric back and asking questions had not changed anything and asking questions might have made things worse in ways that he couldn't afford to make things worse.

"I appreciate the opportunity," Helmar heard himself say, the words emerging from somewhere that wasn't quite his conscious decision, the automatic response that thirty years of administrative training had programmed into his professional reflexes. "I look forward to serving the institution's needs."

"Excellent." Varkus's smile broadened, the satisfaction of a transaction successfully completed. "I knew you'd understand. You've always been someone who understands how institutions function."

The server returned with their meals, the interruption providing a natural transition from professional negotiation to professional dining, the food arriving with the timing that suggested either excellent kitchen coordination or staff trained to recognize when conversations had reached appropriate pausing points. Helmar ate without tasting, his Säide continuing its warm pulse of warning, his mind cycling through implications that he didn't want to examine too closely because examining them would require acknowledging what he'd just agreed to.

"One more thing," Varkus said, midway through the main course, his tone casual in the way that important information was often delivered casually to disguise its importance. "There's a records clerk in your current division. Grigor Sealkeeper. You know him?"

"I know of him." Helmar kept his voice neutral, the professional tone that didn't reveal whether knowing of someone implied positive or negative assessment. "Competent clerk. Attention to detail."

"Excessive attention, perhaps." Varkus set down his utensils with the deliberate precision that administrators used when they wanted their words to carry weight. "He's been accessing files outside his authorization level. Asking questions about documentation patterns. The kind of curiosity that's admirable in some contexts and problematic in others."

"I see."

"I'd appreciate it if you kept an eye on him. Noted anything unusual. Reported anything that might suggest his curiosity is becoming... institutionally inconvenient." Varkus picked up his utensils again, the gesture signaling that the important part of the conversation was complete and the remainder could return to professional pleasantry. "Nothing formal. Just awareness. The kind of awareness that colleagues maintain for each other's benefit."

"Understood."

The dinner continued for another hour, the conversation shifting to topics that didn't require Helmar to commit to anything he couldn't later deny committing to--departmental politics, institutional gossip, the kind of social lubrication that professional relationships required even when the relationships had just been revealed as transactional in ways that social lubrication was supposed to disguise. Helmar participated appropriately, said the expected things at the expected moments, and filed away every word Varkus said in the perfect memory that his Säide provided.

Varkus mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that there was a backlog of minor reports that needed routing before the transition--routine filings that previous administrators had let accumulate. "Construct maintenance reports, facility variance documentation, that sort of thing. Nothing requiring attention, just requiring processing." Helmar had nodded without thinking, because processing was what he did, because routing documentation was reflex rather than decision. Later, he would remember that one of those reports--flagged as "routine construct behavioral variance, recommended dismissal"--had described a mining unit that had stopped working for seventeen seconds, stood motionless in the middle of a shaft, and then resumed operations as if nothing had happened. The report noted that witnesses described the construct as "looking at something that wasn't there." Helmar had routed it to the dismissal archive without reading past the summary header, because the summary said "routine" and routine meant "not requiring attention" and attention was what he was being paid to allocate according to institutional priorities.

For the record: Supervisor Varkus has instructed me to surveil a colleague.

For the record: Supervisor Varkus has implied that documentation in my new position will require alteration according to institutional needs.

For the record: I have accepted these instructions without objection.

For the record: I have done exactly what Aldric didn't do.

When the dinner concluded and Helmar walked home through Midworks streets that he'd walked thousands of times before, his Säide remained active in ways that cognitive-enhancement strains usually didn't--processing, analyzing, connecting patterns that his conscious mind hadn't yet assembled into coherent recognition. The promotion wasn't reward. The promotion was purchase. Varkus had bought something with it, and the something wasn't merely Helmar's skills--it was Helmar's complicity, his willingness to participate in whatever documentation manipulation the Special Documentation Division existed to perform.

The structure was becoming visible now, the architecture of institutional control that he'd been part of for thirty years without recognizing what he was part of. Varkus had a supervisor, who had a supervisor, who reported to administrators whose names appeared on organizational charts but whose actual functions remained deliberately obscure. The Special Documentation Division didn't exist to create documentation--it existed to curate it, to ensure that certain information flowed to certain places and other information disappeared into archives where it would never be retrieved. A security apparatus, he realized. Not the official security services that everyone knew about, but something beneath them, something that used paperwork as weapon and filing systems as fortification.

Aldric would have asked questions. Aldric had asked questions, and Aldric had died in an industrial accident that the paperwork called equipment failure, and Helmar had filed the documentation correctly and hadn't asked anything because he'd been afraid of what the answers might cost him.

Twelve years of not asking. Twelve years of filing correctly and not examining what he filed. Twelve years of being exactly the kind of administrator that institutions valued because he could be trusted to do his job without doing more than his job, to process without questioning, to serve without understanding what his service enabled.

Now he was being promoted for that quality. Promoted into a position where his quality of not-questioning would be put to use in ways that he could already sense would be worse than anything he'd not-questioned before.

His apartment was empty when he arrived, as it had been empty for twelve years, as it would remain empty until he died or moved or something changed in ways that empty apartments didn't change on their own. Helmar hung his administrative robes in the closet, changed into the comfortable clothes that he wore when no one was watching, and sat in the chair that had been Aldric's favorite--the one he'd kept even when keeping it hurt, even when visitors asked why he didn't replace it with something that didn't remind him of loss every time he looked at it.

"I took the job," he said to the empty room, to the memory of his husband, to the version of himself that might have made a different choice if he'd been a different person. "I took the job and agreed to watch Grigor and didn't ask what the files were for. I did exactly what they expected me to do."

The empty room didn't answer. Empty rooms never did.

But his Säide pulsed warm, and somewhere in the patterns his enhanced cognition was processing, something was beginning to take shape--a recognition that had been building for years, that had started the day he'd filed Aldric's death certificate and noticed the irregularities and done nothing about them, that was now crystallizing into understanding he couldn't unfeel even if he wanted to.

The system that had killed Aldric was the system he'd agreed to serve more deeply. The documentation he'd been asked to manage was the documentation that made that system possible. The questions Grigor was asking were the questions Helmar should have asked twelve years ago, and instead of asking them he'd agreed to report on the person who was brave enough or foolish enough to ask.

He sat in his husband's chair until the artificial lighting shifted to its night cycle, thinking about paperwork and complicity and the cowardice that administrative culture rewarded with promotion. Then he went to bed, and slept poorly, and woke with his Säide still warm and his mind still processing and the beginning of something that might have been conscience or might have been simple recognition that he'd made a terrible mistake.

For the record: I know what I've done.

For the record: I don't know if I can undo it.

For the record: I'm going to try.

### Scene 2

> *Torven -- Vikstrom Residence, Midworks District, Morning After*

---

The watchers had withdrawn with the artificial dawn, their Säide signatures dispersing into the background noise of a waking district like predators retreating from daylight that they had no biological reason to fear. Torven had tracked their departure with attention the previous night had demanded, watching the pattern of their distribution shift and thin until the only signatures his Säide detected were the ordinary residents of an ordinary Midworks neighborhood going about ordinary Midworks business.

Ordinary. The word felt hollow now, felt like the comfortable lie that people told themselves when they didn't want to think too hard about what ordinary might be concealing. Ordinary neighborhoods didn't get surrounded by coordinated observers holding positions through the night. Ordinary protection contracts didn't attract the attention of people organized enough to mount surveillance operations with rotating coverage and apparent institutional backing. Ordinary mercenary commanders didn't find themselves wondering whether the company they'd built over twenty years was adequate to the situation they'd apparently accepted.

Kris found him on the upper balcony, the slight stiffness in his second-in-command's movement suggesting that he'd slept as little as Torven had and recovered from it less gracefully. The morning light through the ventilation grates cast artificial shadows that passed for dawn in the underground, and neither man commented on the circles under the other's eyes because commenting would have acknowledged weakness that professional relationships didn't acknowledge.

"They're gone," Kris said, not a question because they both already knew the answer.

"For now." Torven didn't look at his second-in-command, keeping his attention on the street below where the first merchants were opening their shops and the first laborers were heading to their shifts and the first evidence of normal life was accumulating in the spaces the watchers had occupied. "They'll be back tonight. Maybe before."

"What do we do?"

The question deserved a better answer than Torven had. The question deserved a tactical response, a strategic plan, the kind of confident direction that commanders were supposed to provide when subordinates asked what came next. But Torven had spent the night thinking about watchers who weren't afraid of being seen, about surveillance that was message rather than concealment, about the implications of enemies who wanted you to know they could reach you whenever they wanted.

"We protect the client." Torven's voice sounded tired even to his own ears, the exhaustion that he'd been managing leaking through the professional control that he'd maintained during the night. "That's the contract. That's what we're being paid for."

"Against what? We don't know who they are, what they want, what resources they have. Last night they just watched. What happens when watching isn't enough for them anymore?"

"Then we find out what happens, and we respond accordingly, and we do the job we agreed to do until the job becomes impossible or the client terminates the contract." Torven finally turned to face Kris, letting his second-in-command see the weariness that the night had accumulated. "You've been doing this work long enough to know that most contracts are straightforward. Most threats are manageable. Most situations resolve themselves one way or another without requiring heroics."

"This doesn't feel like most situations."

"No. It doesn't."

They stood together on the balcony as the district woke around them, watching normal life unfold in the spaces that had held coordinated surveillance until the artificial dawn had prompted their withdrawal. Somewhere in the residence below, their client was presumably awakening to another day of fear, another day of wondering when the threat that had claimed his colleagues would claim him, another day of depending on mercenaries to stand between him and whatever wanted him dead.

Torven thought about the names on the list he'd kept for twenty-three years, the people he'd failed to protect, the debts he'd been paying in small increments across decades of work that never quite balanced the ledger. He thought about Vikstrom's terrified description of colleagues who'd gone Hollow overnight, impossible deaths that medical science couldn't explain but that had happened anyway. He thought about the note that Vikstrom had burned--*The Thread remembers you*--and the phrase that seemed to suggest ideology without revealing what ideology it represented.

"I need to know more," he said, the decision crystallizing as he spoke it. "About the deaths. About the committee they all served on. About whatever they were doing that made someone decide they needed to die."

"The client has that information."

"The client has some of it. The client might not know what information he has, might not recognize which details matter because he doesn't know what he's looking for." Torven pushed away from the balcony railing, the movement decisive in the way that decisions needed to be decisive even when the person making them wasn't confident in them. "I need to find someone who knows how people die in this city. Someone who can tell me whether overnight Hollowing is actually possible or whether Vikstrom's colleagues died of something else that someone wanted to disguise."

"The Saide-Writ Academy would have that expertise."

"The Saide-Writ Academy would also have institutional reasons to avoid sharing information with mercenaries asking inconvenient questions." Torven began moving toward the stairs, toward the interior of the residence, toward the practical work of arranging coverage and briefing staff and doing the job he was being paid to do while also trying to understand what the job was actually requiring of him. "But you're not wrong. The Academy is where the expertise lives. I just need to find someone there who's more interested in answers than in protecting institutional interests."

"Good luck with that."

"Luck has nothing to do with it." Torven paused at the threshold, looking back at his second-in-command with an expression that combined exhaustion and determination in proportions that he couldn't quite calculate. "If I'm lucky, I'll find someone who cares about the truth. If I'm not lucky, I'll find someone who can be convinced that caring about the truth serves their interests. Either way, I'll find someone."

Kris nodded, accepting the assignment that hadn't quite been given but that had been implied clearly enough to constitute instruction. Hold the position. Maintain coverage. Keep the client alive while the commander pursued information that the protection contract required but didn't include.

Torven descended into the residence, into the work of briefing and arranging and preparing for another day of protection that might or might not be adequate against a threat he didn't understand. Behind him, the morning continued its artificial progression through the spectrum of lighting that simulated a day cycle nobody alive had ever experienced naturally.

Somewhere in the city, people were investigating deaths that the official documentation called natural causes.

Somewhere in the city, people were manipulating files to ensure that documentation said what it needed to say.

Somewhere in the city, people were arranging bodies on a surface that most citizens pretended didn't exist.

Somewhere in the city, people were deciding what to do about the Unseeded communities that lived outside the protection that Säide provided.

And somewhere in the city, watchers were resting from a night's observation, preparing to resume surveillance when the evening came, confident that they could reach their target whenever they decided reaching was necessary.

Part One was complete. The pattern was given. All threads were active.

What came next would determine whether understanding the pattern was possible--or whether understanding it would simply make the pattern's consequences easier to recognize as they arrived.

### Chapter Notes

**Seeds Planted**:
- Helmar's complicity arc established (took the promotion, agreed to watch Grigor)
- Aldric's death 12 years ago implied as murder disguised as industrial accident
- Varkus as handler/middle management for conspiracy
- Grigor identified as threat to the system, Helmar instructed to surveil him
- Torven recognizes need for medical expertise (will connect to Sigurd in Part 2)

**Sensory Immersion**:
- Restaurant ambiguity (The Balanced Ledger name)
- Server professional invisibility, timing conversations
- Säide cognitive-enhancement as warning system (warm pulsing)
- Empty apartment, Aldric's chair kept for 12 years
- Morning light through ventilation grates

**Dark Humor Beats**:
- Restaurant named The Balanced Ledger for administrative clientele
- "Luck has nothing to do with it... I'll find someone who can be convinced that caring about truth serves their interests"
- "For the record" repetitions as ironic documentation of complicity
- Varkus's phrases ("documentation that arrives in certain forms and departs in certain other forms")
- "The paperwork is impeccable. That's the horror."

**Character Voice Achieved**:
- Helmar: Bureaucratic precision, documentation reflexes, institutional thinking
- Internal conflict between professional training and emerging conscience
- "For the record" as verbal tic that becomes ironic self-accusation
- Torven: Tactical assessment, professional competence, out-of-depth awareness

**Thematic Setup**:
- Complicity vs. conscience in institutional systems
- Documentation as tool of both concealment and revelation
- The system that serves power, not justice
- All POV characters now introduced, all threads active

**Structural Note**:
The Torven night-watch scene (watchers surrounding residence) was included in Chapter 1 as Scene 2. This Chapter 5 Scene 2 provides the morning-after follow-up rather than duplicating that content.

**PART ONE COMPLETE**
- Ch 1: Torven introduced, contract accepted, watchers revealed
- Ch 2: Sigurd and Helmar first scenes, medical and bureaucratic angles
- Ch 3: Kaisa introduced, surface mystery established
- Ch 4: Eneko introduced, Unseeded political dimension
- Ch 5: Helmar's complicity, all threads active

**Word Count**: ~4,200
