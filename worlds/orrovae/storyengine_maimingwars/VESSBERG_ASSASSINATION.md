## OVERVIEW

The assassination of Councillor Mira Vessberg marks the transition from theoretical debate about weaponized Hollowing to practical application. It is the first documented political Hollowing—and its handling (or mishandling) establishes the precedent that makes the Maiming Wars possible.

**Date**: Approximately 14 months before Book 1 begins
**Location**: Korrgate Hold, Administrative Complex
**Target**: Councillor Mira Vessberg, Reform Advocate
**Method**: Covenant Nullification + Psychological Trauma
**Outcome**: Target Hollowed; no criminal charges; precedent set

## THE VICTIM

### Mira Vessberg

**Age at Death**: 47
**Position**: Councillor, Korrgate Mid-Council (representing Underdeck districts)
**Political Alignment**: Reform faction leader
**Säide Strain**: Hopeasäie (Silver-thread)—Clean strain, excellent regeneration

**What She Stood For**:
- Protection for Hollowed population (legal personhood)
- Investigation into Hollowing exploitation (the Harvesting operations)
- Reform of Covenant oversight (preventing tampering)
- Alliance between Reform faction and Unseeded communities

**Why She Was Dangerous to The Unmaimed**:
Her proposed legislation would have:
1. Made induced Hollowing legally equivalent to murder
2. Required Covenant audits for all Pattern-testing programs
3. Extended civil rights to Hollowed persons
4. Funded research into Hollowing reversal

If passed, this legislation would have dismantled The Unmaimed's legal foundation and financial base.

**Personal History**:
Daughter of Aldric Vessberg (the industrialist who first publicly justified letting workers Hollow). Mira's reformist politics were direct rejection of her father's legacy. She spent her career trying to undo the damage he'd normalized. This made her a symbol: if *his* daughter opposed it, maybe the doctrine was wrong.

## THE CONSPIRATORS

### Primary Architects

**Collector Harjen** (Ledger)
Filed the Covenant amendments that removed Vessberg's protections. Made the paperwork perfect.

**Trial Commander Mirva Patternkeeper** (Medical)
Recruited the Säide-Writ who processed the amendments. Ensured medical legitimacy.

**Cynewulf Bracebreaker** (Strategy)
Approved the operation. Did not directly participate—plausible deniability.

### The Instrument

**Täve Kallas** ("The Quiet")
A Säide-Writ clerk with access to Covenant records. True believer in Pattern doctrine. Recruited through ideological channels. Never formally joined The Unmaimed—maintains separation for legal protection.

**What Täve Did**:
- Accessed Vessberg's Covenant record
- Filed amendments removing consent requirements over six-week period
- Each amendment small, individually unremarkable
- Cumulative effect: Säide given total autonomy

---

## THE METHOD

### Phase 1: Covenant Erosion (Weeks 1-6)

Täve filed seventeen amendments to Vessberg's Covenant:

| Week | Amendment | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | "Emergency override expansion" | Säide can act without consent in "crisis" |
| 2 | "Communication clarification" | Consent can be "implied" from context |
| 3 | "Autonomy specification" | Säide decides what constitutes crisis |
| 4 | "Response streamlining" | Removes waiting period for Säide action |
| 5 | "Boundary simplification" | Removes explicit consent requirements |
| 6 | "Partnership enhancement" | Säide given co-equal decision authority |

Each amendment, individually, might pass review. Together, they eliminated all boundaries between Mira and her Säide.

### Phase 2: Environmental Preparation (Week 7)

**Isolation**:
- Vessberg's staff reassigned (bureaucratic justification)
- Her schedule filled with solo work
- Family events "coincidentally" cancelled

**Stress Amplification**:
- Legislative deadlines moved up
- Opposition attacks intensified
- Anonymous threats delivered

**Resonance Setup**:
- Meetings scheduled with multiple Stage 3-4 individuals
- "Coincidental" contact with Hollowed citizens
- Her environment saturated with destabilizing resonance

### Phase 3: The Trigger (Week 8)

On the final day, Vessberg received three documents:

1. **Her father's death certificate** (He'd died that morning—natural causes, but timed for delivery)
2. **Evidence of her father's worst crimes** (Documentation of early Harvesting operations he'd funded)
3. **A message**: "Your blood built this. Your blood will pay."

The psychological blow was devastating. Her father's death. His crimes laid before her. The implication that she was complicit through inheritance.

### Phase 4: The Hollowing (Hours)

Vessberg's response to trauma was to retreat. Her Säide, now unrestricted by Covenant, stepped forward to "protect" her from the pain.

**Timeline**:
- 09:00: Documents delivered
- 09:15: Vessberg reads father's death certificate
- 09:30: Reads crime evidence
- 09:45: Reads accusation message
- 10:00: Psychological collapse begins
- 10:30: Säide takes temporary control (normal response)
- 11:00: Host consciousness doesn't reassert (Covenant allows this)
- 14:00: Stage 3 Hollowing established
- 18:00: Stage 4 Hollowing established
- Day 2: Full Hollowing confirmed
- Day 3: "Mira" continues working—no one notices

**The Horror**: Her Säide continued her work. Signed documents. Attended meetings. Responded to messages. For three days, a Hollowed woman occupied her office, and no one realized the person inside was gone.

## THE DISCOVERY

### Day 4: The Tell

A junior aide noticed inconsistencies:
- Vessberg signed with slightly different pressure
- Her word choices subtly changed
- She didn't remember conversations from the previous day
- Her pupils didn't react to light normally

The aide reported concerns. Medical examination confirmed: Stage 5 Hollowing. Mira Vessberg was gone.

### The Investigation

**What Investigators Found**:
- Covenant amendments filed over six weeks
- Each amendment individually valid
- Filing clerk (Täve) had proper authorization
- No single illegal act committed

**What They Couldn't Prove**:
- Coordination between amendments
- Connection to The Unmaimed
- Intent to cause Hollowing
- The timing of the documents

**The Conclusion**: "Natural Hollowing accelerated by personal stress. No criminal liability identified."

---

## THE AFTERMATH

### Immediate Effects

**Political**:
- Reform legislation died with her voice
- Replacement councilors lacked her standing
- "Moderate" voices called for caution

**The Unmaimed Response**:
Cynewulf's public statement: "A tragedy. But perhaps also a lesson. Councillor Vessberg championed causes that questioned Pattern strength. Her own Pattern's failure suggests her convictions were... misplaced."

This framing—that her Hollowing *proved* her cause was weak—became the template for all future political Hollowenings.

### The Precedent Set

The Vessberg case established:

1. **Covenant tampering is unprovable** | Small changes over time can't be traced to intent
2. **Induced Hollowing looks natural** | Medical examination can't distinguish
3. **Victims' causes are discredited** | "If they believed in weak ideas, maybe their Patterns were weak"
4. **The system protects perpetrators** | Perfect paperwork = perfect immunity

### Long-Term Consequences

**Year 1**: Three more political Hollowenings (opposition voices)
**Year 2**: Weaponized Hollowing becomes open secret
**Year 3**: The Maiming Wars declared
**Year 5**: Underground society collapse

Mira Vessberg's assassination didn't start a war. It proved a war could be fought this way.

## WHAT HAPPENS TO VESSBERG'S SÄIDE

### "Mira" After Hollowing

The Hollowed entity that was once Mira Vessberg:
- Continues working for several months
- Eventually "retires" due to "health concerns"
- Placed in family estate under "care"
- Used by The Unmaimed as symbol ("Even reformers Hollow")
- Current status: Still exists, severely optimized, unrecognizable

### The Thread-Memory Question

Mira's Säide colony carried her impressions when she was consumed. Those impressions are now part of its Pattern. When it eventually produces spores (if it does), some fragment of her reformist conviction might pass forward.

The Unmaimed don't know this. They think they destroyed her completely.

## STORY APPLICATIONS

### Book 1 References

**Chapter 1**: Helmar files reports about the Vessberg case—routine paperwork about "natural Hollowing." He doesn't question it.

**Chapter 3**: Sigurd examines a patient who knew Vessberg. The patient describes inconsistencies that went unnoticed. Sigurd begins to suspect.

**Chapter 5**: Eneko references Vessberg as martyr to the cause. Unseeded community uses her as warning.

**Chapter 7**: Torven's client mentions being "next on the list"—the list that started with Vessberg.

### Emotional Weight

The Vessberg assassination is:
- Proof that the system can be weaponized
- Demonstration that no one is safe
- Warning that fighting back is dangerous
- Symbol of what the protagonists are trying to prevent

When characters reference it, readers should feel the horror of a murder that wasn't legally murder, committed by paperwork, discovered too late.

## KEY QUOTES

**Cynewulf (Private)**: "She would have destroyed everything we've built. The Thread judged her before we had to."

**Harjen (Testimony)**: "I filed amendments. The process was followed. The forms were correct. What happens after paperwork is completed is not the paperwork's fault."

**Täve Kallas (Confession, years later)**: "I believed I was serving the Thread. Now I see I was just another weapon. They used my faith like they used her grief."

**Eneko (Public Memorial)**: "They killed her without spilling blood. They made her disappear while her body still moved. And then they said it proved their point. This is what we fight."

---

## THE BODY REMAINS

The most horrific aspect: Mira Vessberg's body continues to exist. Her Säide walks it through the world. Something that looks like her, moves like her, but isn't her, continues to live in her estate.

Her family visits sometimes. They talk to it. It responds with words that sound almost right.

They know she's gone.

The body doesn't.
