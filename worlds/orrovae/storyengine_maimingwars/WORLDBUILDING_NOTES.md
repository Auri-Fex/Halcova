# Worldbuilding Notes - Maiming Wars

## Core World Parameters

### 1. Underground Civilization
- Humanity lives underground following "The Scouring" - surface is hostile
- Actinic radiation damages Säide, causes cancer in unprotected humans
- Surface only accessed by specialized "Runners" in protective suits
- Architecture: carved stone warrens, tunnels, sealed transit corridors
- Terminology: "The Sump" (lowest levels), "Crownwalk" (upper tiers), "Ruinfields" (surface ruins)

### 2. Technology Level: 1860s-1880s Baseline
**Allowed:**
- Glowstock lighting (bioluminescent/chemical)
- Gas lamps, oil lamps, candles
- Steam/mechanical pump systems
- Manual labor, hand tools
- Physical paper documents, seals, stamps
- Säide-based biotech (the one exception - see below)

**Not Allowed:**
- Electric lighting, motors
- Telephones, radio, wireless communication
- Internal combustion engines, motor vehicles
- Digital/electronic anything

**Säide-Tech Exception:**
The Säide symbiote enables certain "advanced" biological technologies that wouldn't otherwise exist:
- Resonance stabilizers (bio-sync devices for colony stabilization)
- Diagnostic implements that read colony health
- Communication systems using Säide-resonance (limited range)
These are *biological* technologies, not mechanical/electrical - they work through symbiotic tissue, not wires.

## 3. IMPERFECT REGENERATION (CRITICAL RULE)

### The Säide keeps you alive. It doesn't make you pretty.

Säide regeneration is **survival healing**, not restoration:

**What it DOES:**
- Keeps host alive through otherwise-fatal injuries
- Closes wounds, stops bleeding, fights infection
- Repairs enough function to survive
- Speeds healing compared to unassisted humans

**What it DOES NOT do:**
- Restore tissue to original condition
- Eliminate scarring
- Reverse cosmetic damage
- "Perfect" healing

### Visual Evidence of Säide Partnership

Every seeded person accumulates **visible wear** from their Säide's work:
- **Scars**: Healed cuts, punctures, burns leave permanent marks
- **Stitching patterns**: Where colony tissue knit wounds closed, faint raised lines remain
- **Texture changes**: Repeatedly healed skin has different quality - shinier, thinner, or thicker
- **Color variations**: Healed areas may be paler or darker than surrounding tissue
- **Seamwork**: The integration lines where Säide connects to host tissue are permanently visible

### Character Implications

**Old veterans** show extensive healing evidence:
- Tomasz (30 years surface work): "more seamwork than exposed skin" - a patchwork of healed damage
- Torven (23 years mercenary): hands and arms mapped with pale lines from old wounds
- Sigurd (8 years medical): fingers show accumulated nicks and cuts, healed but visible

**The wealthy** try to minimize visible work:
- "Clean-strain" variants produce less visible seamwork
- But even clean-strains can't hide severe damage
- Crownwalk families prize subtle seamwork as status marker

**Damage compounds:**
- Each new injury heals, but adds to the total visible evidence
- A person's body becomes a map of their survival history
- "Every wound from now on will heal slower, scar heavier" (bond damage)

### Thematic Purpose

This imperfect healing serves the story:
1. **Mortality reminder**: The Säide doesn't make you invincible
2. **Visual characterization**: Bodies tell life stories
3. **Stakes**: Getting hurt matters - the mark stays
4. **Horror potential**: What does catastrophic damage look like healed?
5. **Class markers**: Clean healing = wealth, visible healing = labor

### Writing Reminder

When describing seeded characters, note:
- Their hands, arms, faces show accumulated healing
- Older characters have more visible evidence
- Working-class characters show more damage than upper-tier
- Even "clean-strain" Säide leaves *some* evidence

### Integration in Drafts (Book 1)

**CH01**: Torven's arms - "topographical map of every wound that had required more than surface repair"
**CH03**: Tomasz - "patchwork of healed damage... scars layered over each other like sediment"
**CH08**: Torven - "a ledger of violence survived that would follow him to his grave"
**CH09**: Vikstrom post-attack - "heal slower, scar heavier" (bond damage warning)
