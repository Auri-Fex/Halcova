# BOOK 2: THE HOLLOWING PRICE
## *Tyhjäämisen Hinta*

**Word Target**: 100,000+
**POV Characters**: Torven (A), Sigurd (B), Kaisa (C), Eneko (D), Grigor (E)
**POV Death**: Torven Grast (Lane A) — B2.P5.C12.S2
**Macro Function**: COMPLICATION — War escalates, maiming as doctrine, Torven dies

---

## BOOK SUMMARY

The war has a name now: everyone calls it the Maiming Wars, though no one officially admits it. "The Unmaimed" doctrine spreads like fever through the population—the belief that those who Hollow or suffer permanent damage were weak in their Pattern, that maiming reveals rather than creates inferiority. As the factions develop increasingly sophisticated weapons and tactics, the body becomes the battleground. Torven Grast, the mercenary who thought he'd seen everything, survives impossible combat only to die of an infection his Säide can't reach. Kaisa's crew is massacred on the surface—but she alone is spared, and she doesn't know why. The constructs begin to glitch in ways that can't be explained as malfunction.

---

## THEMATIC FOCUS

**Question**: When healing becomes a weapon, who decides what you "deserve" to keep?
**Answer Suggested**: Power decides—but power's judgment reveals power's corruption
**Complication**: The doctrine claims objectivity while serving faction interests
