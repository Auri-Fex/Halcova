## THEMATIC STORY SPINE

**Axis 1 — Power/Cost**: *"Every miracle has a supply chain. Every body keeps a ledger."*
**Axis 2 — Rebellion/Empire**: *"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."*

The saga is the violent expression of both axes colliding:
- **Power/Cost**: Weaponized Hollowing forces permanent loss. Every faction pays in bodies.
- **Rebellion/Empire**: The underground empire tried to forget its abandoned kin. The constructs rebel because ownership cannot provide stability. The war ends when the "monsters" reveal they're coming home.

See `../01_story_spine/thematic_core.md` for complete thematic architecture.
