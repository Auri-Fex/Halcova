# VOICE ANCHOR -- READ BEFORE EVERY DRAFT

**CRITICAL**: This file must be read and internalized before drafting ANY scene. The voice requirements are non-negotiable.

---

## The Cal E. Jackson Voice

A fusion of:
- **Joe Abercrombie**: brutal realism, dark humor
- **Brent Weeks**: vivid imagery, fast action
- **George R.R. Martin**: layered tension, moral ambiguity
- **Nic Pizzolatto** (True Detective): philosophical depth, noir atmosphere, poetic prose

## SENTENCE STRUCTURE -- THE CORE RULE

### WRONG (Staccato/Summary Mode):
```
The morgue was cold. Sigurd examined the body. The damage was unusual. He didn't believe it was natural.

Three deaths. Same committee. Same cause.

"This wasn't natural," Sigurd said.
```

### RIGHT (Flowing/Multi-clause):
```
The morgue was cold by design, but Sigurd had never quite adjusted to the way that particular chill settled into his joints during long examinations, the biological necessity of tissue preservation doing nothing to make the psychological weight of dead flesh and fluorescent silence any easier to carry after six years of training and two of practice.

He'd examined enough Hollowing cases to know the progression--the gradual withdrawal, the slow failure, the months of visible symptoms that preceded the end--and nothing about the body on his table matched that pattern, which meant either everything he'd learned was wrong or someone had found a way to make Hollowing happen on a schedule, neither possibility being the kind of thing a man wanted to discover before his morning coffee.
```

### The Technique:
- **Use subordinating conjunctions**: "which meant," "because," "though," "while," "as if"
- **Chain clauses with em-dashes**: interruptions, asides, qualifications
- **Let thoughts spiral**: one observation leads to implication leads to memory leads to reaction
- **Vary rhythm**: long flowing passages punctuated by SHORT IMPACT when earned (not constant)

---

## DARK HUMOR -- MANDATORY

**Minimum**: 2-3 dark humor beats per scene. Not optional.

### Types:
- **Sardonic observation**: Character notices absurdity/hypocrisy
- **Gallows humor**: Joking in face of death/danger
- **Bitter callbacks**: References to earlier failures/losses
- **Understatement**: "Well, that's inconvenient" when everything is on fire
- **Self-aware hopelessness**: Acknowledging doom while continuing anyway

### Examples of Correct Tone:
```
"The Academy had trained him to identify exactly the kind of anomalies that the Academy apparently didn't want identified, which was either an oversight in the curriculum or a very dark joke that no one had thought to warn him about."

"He'd survived twenty-three years of mercenary work by developing excellent instincts for when situations were about to become expensive, and this situation had the particular smell of invoices he'd be paying for years."

"Natural causes, the certificate said. Sigurd had seen a lot of natural causes in his career, and none of them had involved tissue that looked like it had been cooked from the inside out, but perhaps the definition had changed while he wasn't paying attention."
```

### Red Flag:
If a scene is **relentlessly earnest**--all grim observations, no bitter wit--it's wrong. Add humor in revision.

---

## PHYSICAL/SENSORY IMMERSION -- WOVEN, NOT STATED

### WRONG:
```
The morgue was cold. There was a body on the table. The examination lamp was bright.
```

### RIGHT:
```
The examination lamp threw harsh shadows across the chest cavity he'd opened twenty minutes ago, the kind of light that made everything look worse than it probably was, though in this case "worse" might have been underselling the damage he was looking at--colony tissue shouldn't char, shouldn't show the kind of thermal scarring that suggested something had burned the Saide from the inside out, and yet here he was, documentation pad in hand, trying to find technical language for "what the actual hell happened to this man."
```

### The Rule:
Sensory details arrive **through action and thought**, not as static description blocks. The character experiences the environment while doing something else.

---

## POV VOICE FILTERING

Each POV character notices different things:

- **Torven**: Tactical assessment, threat evaluation, professional competence markers
- **Sigurd**: Medical precision, diagnostic patterns, institutional frameworks
- **Kaisa**: Emotional undercurrents, social dynamics, hidden motives
- **Eneko**: Historical context, spiritual significance, tradition vs. change
- **Helmar**: Procedural correctness, documentation patterns, systemic implications

The narrative voice shifts to match. Sigurd's scenes should feel clinical but increasingly disturbed. Helmar's should feel bureaucratic but morally weighted. Torven's should feel competent but increasingly out of depth.

---

## PARAGRAPH RHYTHM CHECK

Before finalizing any scene, scan for:

1. **Too many single-sentence paragraphs in a row** → Combine, add subordinate clauses
2. **Paragraph endings that all have the same punch rhythm** → Vary the landing
3. **Absence of em-dashes and parenthetical asides** → Add qualifying thoughts
4. **No humor in 500+ words** → Insert sardonic observation
5. **Description blocks separate from action** → Weave together

---

## SAMPLE VOICE -- CORRECT SIGURD

```
The body of Halvar Lindqvist had been a guild official in life, and in death he was becoming a problem that Sigurd increasingly suspected he wasn't being paid enough to solve--though "paid" was generous language for the stipend the Academy provided, and "solve" implied a degree of agency that his position didn't actually grant him, so perhaps the more accurate framing was that he was witnessing a problem he would eventually be punished for noticing.

The examination lamp caught the seamwork on Lindqvist's arms, the kind of crisp ridging that suggested a workhorse strain maintained with more care than most people bothered to invest, and Sigurd found himself wondering whether the man had been proud of that visibility or merely resigned to it. A question that would never be answered now, along with several more pressing questions about why his Saide tissue looked like it had been flash-cooked from the inside out when every training manual Sigurd had ever read insisted that colonies failed slowly, gracefully, with months of warning symptoms that gave families time to prepare.

Three hundred and forty percent cellular degradation, his notes said, which was a very clinical way of describing damage that had no business existing in a natural Hollowing case. He'd written it in the precise technical language the Academy required, partly because precision was the foundation of good science and partly because if anyone ever read these notes and asked uncomfortable questions, he wanted plausible deniability that he'd understood the implications of what he was documenting.

A man could go a long way on plausible deniability. His mentor had taught him that, along with several other lessons about institutional survival that were probably more valuable than anything in the formal curriculum.

## PRE-DRAFT CHECKLIST

Before writing ANY scene:

- [ ] Identified POV character's voice filter
- [ ] Planned at least 2 dark humor beats
- [ ] Noted key sensory details to weave through action
- [ ] Reminded self: FLOWING sentences, not staccato
- [ ] Checked that this scene has emotional/tonal variation (not one-note)

---

## THE FINAL TEST

Read your draft aloud. Does it sound like:

**A)** A True Detective monologue with medical/fantasy terminology?
**B)** A Wikipedia article with occasional dialogue?

If B, redraft. Always A.
