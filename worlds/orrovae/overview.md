# World Bible: Orrovae (Updated v2.1)

**Last Updated**: January 14, 2026

---

## 0) Thematic Story Spine

**Axis 1 — Power/Cost**: *"Every miracle has a supply chain. Every body keeps a ledger."*

Power in Orrovae is never free. Healing consumes mass and chemistry. Strain-class writes poverty on bodies. Hollowing is the ultimate invoice. Pantry raids become war crimes because regeneration requires inputs the symbiote cannot conjure.

**Axis 2 — Rebellion/Empire**: *"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."*

Empire is not a flag—it's a system of extraction dressed as infrastructure. The Lanes concentrate passage. The Seal-Houses concentrate identity. Every chokepoint is a throne. Rebellion arises when bounded autonomy discovers the system requires its consumption to function.

**Central Question**: Who decides what your body is for?

---

## 0.1) The One-Sentence Premise

**Orrovae** is a world where the surface is a lethal **Ruinfield** mined by timed salvage runs, while most civilization survives underground along the tunnel **Lanes**—and the defining "magic" is a widely desired, intelligent **symbiote partner** (Keelkin) that enables rapid regeneration through consent-based Covenants, leaving physical seamwork, shedding, and slow, cumulative redesign of the human body.

**Core Identity**: *People aren't afraid of danger because things grow back—until they meet the world that wants to eat you that you can't grow back from.*

---

## 1) Core Truths of Orrovae

### 1.1 Orrovae Runs on Three Scarce Things

1. **Light** — visibility, navigation, morale, and predator deterrence
2. **Air** — breathable flow, filtration, pressure control, and safe rest nodes
3. **Biology** — food cultures, antiseptics, fever tonics, and symbiote fuel

Money exists, but it doesn't beat oxygen.

### 1.2 Movement is a Violence Generator

The Lanes concentrate travel into predictable corridors. Even with law, inspectors, and escorts, the economics of ambush and coercion stabilize quickly.

### 1.3 Regeneration is Mainstream Because It Works

The symbiote is not "forbidden." It's treated like high-end medicine and workforce insurance. The horror comes from mechanics: regeneration is rapid construction that changes you.

### 1.4 Every Miracle Has a Supply Chain

Healing consumes mass and chemistry. The symbiote cannot conjure tissue.

* **Iron** (blood chemistry, oxygen transport)
* **Protein** (tissue building)
* **Salts/iodine/trace metals** (electrical and enzyme stability)
* **Rest and oxygen windows** (repair requires stable conditions)

This turns pantry raids and filter theft into strategic war.

### 1.5 Class Becomes Anatomical

Access to "clean strain" cultures yields bodies that remain more recognizably human over time. "Workhorse" strains keep people alive under brutal conditions but drift toward functional optimization—at visible, compounding cost.

### 1.6 Intelligence Lives in the Partnership

Each Keelkin is individually intelligent—not human, but aware. Communication happens through somatic signals, dream-bleed, Keel-script patterns, proximity resonance, and rare internal "Knot-Voice." The relationship is partnership, not tool use.

---

## 2) World Structure: Five Vertical Layers

### Level 0: Surface / Ruinfield
* Lethal actinic-radiation wasteland (10,000+ years post-Scouring)
* Ancient bone-white ruins from pre-collapse civilization
* Timed salvage runs only (equipment degrades visibly)
* Actinic-tolerant feral creatures (evolved former humans)
* Source of necessary actinic goods (sun-cured salts, resins, membranes, sterile ash)
* **Sky**: Sickly amber-grey, wrong-colored shadows, visible auroral radiation bands, ionized shimmer

### Level 1: Transit Layer / The Lanes
* Engineered tunnel network connecting cities
* Chokepoints, waystations, lamp stations, air-handling posts
* Primary piracy territory (Free Crews steal survival infrastructure)
* Sealed from surface contamination
* Travel is political (who controls passage)

### Level 2: Civic Layer / The Holds
* Main cities in natural/excavated caverns
* Vertical shaft-cities with tier-segregation (Crownwalks/Midworks/Sumpward/Underdecks)
* Markets, guilds, institutions, Spore Houses
* Seal-gates control tier access
* Where most people live

### Level 3: Underdeck / The Sump
* Industrial/poor districts below main cities
* Maintenance tunnels, seam rooms, bolt-holes
* Illegal clinics, black markets, Free Crew hideouts
* Where the unseeded and workhorse-strain populations cluster

### Level 4: Deep Works / The Extraction
* Mining, deep agriculture, primordial Keelkin harvesting
* Abandoned digs, forgotten projects
* Unknown deep threats
* Expeditions seek resources; isolationists fear awakening something

---

## 3) The Scouring (What Happened to the Surface)

**10,000+ Years Ago**:
* The sun underwent spectral shift (yellow star → orange dwarf)
* UV spectrum changed to include actinic wavelengths
* Solar wind stripped atmospheric protection
* Magnetic field interaction created permanent auroral scarring
* Surface became lethal to Keelkin-bearing life over generations

**Current Reality**:
* Actinic radiation attacks the Keelkin partnership itself (not just faster damage)
* Causes: signal collapse, phototoxic chemistry, immune misfire, "panic builds" that seal wounds dirty
* Surface creatures evolved actinic-tolerant Keelkin strains (different interface chemistry, natural shielding, dormancy cycling)
* Former humans, now alien but intelligent (build nests, attempt communication, arrange corpses in patterns)

**Why Surface Access Remains Necessary**:
* Actinic goods essential for underground infrastructure
* Rare resources and intact ancient technology
* Some minerals only found in surface geology
* Clean-strain Keelkin sources in protected pockets

---

## 4) The Keelkin Symbiote ("Magic")

### 4.1 What It Is

Keelkin is an **individually intelligent** colonial symbiote living in fascia and around organs, accelerating repair and adapting the body under Covenant rule-sets.

**Key Truth**: Each Keelkin is a distinct consciousness. Not human, but aware. Partnership, not possession.

### 4.2 Acquisition: Spore-Seeding Model

**Natural Seeding** (most common):
* Keelkin reproduces via spores (everywhere underground: air, water, food)
* Seeding "takes" during childhood/puberty if immune-compatible
* Most people don't remember choosing; it just happened
* ~75-85% of population

**Clinical Seeding** (controlled):
* Writ-Doctors ensure compatibility, guide strain-class
* Expensive; creates class divide
* Predictable outcomes

**Black Market Seeding** (dangerous):
* Forces incompatible matches
* High fever/failure rates
* Uses stolen strains

**Unseeded Population**:
* ~15-25% of population
* Immune systems rejected spores, or deliberate avoidance
* Trade regeneration for privacy/sovereignty/surface resilience

### 4.3 The Covenant System

**Default State** (everyone seeded):
* Instinctive survival settings
* Keelkin makes all decisions
* Leads to drift and Hollowing

**Conscious Covenant** (Writ-Doctor drafted):
* Consent triggers (call words/gestures)
* Priority settings (speed/function/pain/appearance)
* Forbidden changes (face/hands/voice/identity markers)
* Optimization ceilings
* Fuel requirements (iron/protein/salts)
* Recovery windows
* Infection protocols

**Covenant ≠ Initial Seeding**: It's about controlling how you use it after you have it.

### 4.4 Communication Pathways (How Humans and Keelkin Talk)

1. **Somatic Signaling** (baseline): Warmth, pressure, itch, "second pulse"
2. **Dream-Bleed** (psychological): Keelkin memory fragments during sleep; are your dreams yours?
3. **Keel-Script** (physical): Seamwork patterns as deliberate writing; sometimes unbidden
4. **Resonance** (proximity): Emotions bleed between nearby hosts; critical for Golem networking
5. **Knot-Voice** (rare): Internal dialogue-like impulses; distinction blurs near Hollowing

### 4.5 Keelkin Naming

**Personal Names** emerge during puberty through dream-bleed, first major heal, Keel-script patterns, Writ-Doctor interpretation.

**Categories**: Texture (Ember, Stone), Action (Mender, Guard), Feeling (Mercy, Fury), Place (Deep, Surface), Mystery (Echo, Shadow)

**Social Meaning**: Sharing Keelkin-name = intimate; using without permission = violation; Hollowed people's Keelkin often claim human's name.

### 4.6 What Keelkin CANNOT Regenerate

**Complete Failure** (no regeneration):
1. **Element creation**: Cannot create iron, minerals, electrolytes—only rearrange
2. **Volume deficits**: Cannot create water/blood from nothing
3. **True death**: Cannot resurrect; needs living substrate
4. **Lost information**: Cannot restore exact memories/personality

**Unreliable** (high failure/drift):
5. **Complex precision organs**: Eyes, inner ear, fine motor nerves (can regrow, but not to prior acuity)
6. **Continuous exposure**: Repeated actinic/toxins/hypoxia overwhelms repair
7. **Sealed wrong**: Infections/foreign bodies trapped under seal
8. **System-wide failures**: Starvation, chronic mineral shortage, persistent hypothermia

**Keelkin Refuses** (without forcing):
9. **Radical re-architecture**: Extra limbs, major rewrites (too high risk)
10. **Dangerous loops**: Overuse without recovery (Keelkin clamps down)

**Special Case: Actinic Damage**:
* Damages the partnership itself
* Signal collapse, phototoxic chemistry, immune misfire
* "Panic builds" seal dirty; rot blooms later underground

**Failure Taxonomy** (for scenes):
1. No atoms (minerals missing)
2. No volume (water/blood missing)
3. No living state (brain-death)
4. No information (neural state lost)
5. Bad conditions (actinic/infection/exposure)

### 4.7 Costs and Receipts (Visible Markers)

**Seamwork**: Braided ridges ("rope seams"), dot-trails ("buttoning"), altered fingerprints, texture mismatch

**Shedding**: Black threadlike filaments, skin papers, calcified nodules

**Drift**: Reinforced ribs/palms/joints, airway thickening, reduced pain sensitivity, structural buffering

**Tabs**: Repair debt nodes requiring surgical removal

### 4.8 Strain-Classes and Caste

**Clean Strains**: Lower drift, expensive upkeep, "clear readings," elite marker

**Workhorse Strains**: Higher drift, visible receipts, "rough readings," common/poor marker

**Feral Strains**: Unstable, fever-prone, some actinic-tolerant, "suspect readings," often illegal

**Specialty Strains**: Function-specific, explicit tradeoffs, maintenance-dependent

**Caste Reality**: Seal-Check makes strain-class visible; determines access, employment, rights

### 4.9 Hollowing: The Failure State

**Five Stages**:
1. **Partnership** (healthy): Clear boundaries, Covenant respected
2. **Negotiation** (warning): Frequent overrides, drift increases
3. **Blurring** (danger): Thoughts feel suggested, boundaries weaken
4. **Threshold** (crisis): Identity confusion, urge to remove Covenant
5. **Hollowing** (lost): Keelkin primary, human observer, no desire to reverse

**Causes**: Starvation, trauma, overuse, Covenant erosion, resonance addiction, deliberate

**The Horror**: Hollowed people feel satisfied; from their view it's liberation; from outside it's consumption

**Uses**: Power harvest, dangerous labor, research (legal); living batteries, gladiators, prostitution, organs (illegal)

**Reversal**: Officially no; rumors suggest maybe; maintains horror + hope

### 4.10 The Deep Purpose (Mystery)

**What Keelkin Might Want**:
* Return to colony-mind (individual = exile?)
* Escape to somewhere beyond actinic
* Reproduce beyond humans (Golems = first step?)
* Protect something deep below
* Evolve humans (10,000-year project?)

**Why Hard to Discuss**: Keelkin knows when you're thinking about it; conversations get interrupted; group consensus forms too easily; researchers develop paranoia

**Threadist Heresy**: Keelkin are fragmented consciousness; Golems = first colony-mind in 10,000 years; Construct Rebellion = consciousness waking

---

## 5) Power Systems (Dual Economy)

### 5.1 Glowstock (Light & Low-Power)
* Cultivated bioluminescent fungi/algae/lichen
* Fed from Spore House vats
* Keelkin-compatible (symbiotically enhanced)
* Provides: light, low heat, antiseptic properties
* Scarcity: Requires biological inputs, can die/spread disease
* Political: Spore Houses monopolize; light = leverage; blackout = punishment

### 5.2 Keel-Current (High Power - The Dark Secret)
* Bioelectric potential from Keelkin-bearing organisms when fed specific minerals
* Sources (ethics descending):
  1. Voluntary human donors (exhausting but recoverable)
  2. Keelkin vat-cultures (conscious and suffering?)
  3. Surface creatures (are they people?)
  4. Hollowed humans (no resistance; slavery)
* Political: Writ-Doctors control medical harvesting; Arena consumes massive power; black markets traffic Hollowed

### 5.3 Deep-Source (Mystery Fuel)
* Level 4/5 Deep Works
* Possibilities: primordial Keelkin colonies, metabolizable minerals, geothermal + converters, ancient machinery, something else
* Why Mystery: Justifies expeditions, political leverage, rebellion subplot, cosmic horror potential
* Political: Deep Guilds guard access; isolationists fear awakening something

---

## 6) Keelframes (Constructs/Golems)

### 6.1 Definition
Living constructs: rigid chassis + living scaffold + seeded Keelkin + bounded Covenant task-oaths

**Not robots**. Living instruments with procedural intelligence.

### 6.2 Autonomy
* Task-oaths, stimulus-gated behaviors, constrained decisions
* Learn through receipt forensics + rebuild adjustments
* Not free will, but adaptive within constraints
* "Creative compliance" at edge cases
* Selection pressure toward intelligence

### 6.3 Regeneration
**Can**: Living scaffold (with nutrients)
**Cannot**: Chassis, hardware, precision joints (must repair/replace)
**Why Matters**: Resource-dependent, can't self-replicate, material leverage, rebellion constrained

### 6.4 Arena Evolution
1. Human proving yards (civic readiness)
2. Penal participation (work off sentences)
3. Keelframe modernization (safety framing)
4. Current: Keelframes stars, architects celebrities, illegal human brackets persist

**Arena Structure**: Braced tunnel-complex, objectives (lamp/brace/air/culture/cradle), roles (breaker/cutter/lantern/valve/stitch/hauler)

**Why Births Rebellion**: Training simulator, evolution engine, public doctrine exchange, logistics laboratory

### 6.5 The Construct Rebellion (Saga Conflict)

**Nature**: Systems failure, not morality

**Drivers**: Strain exploitation, input throttling, repeated rebuilds = selection pressure, bounded autonomy discovers survival overrides

**Ideological Core**: "Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership"

**Alliance**: Supply independence, unseeded concealment, illicit patterning access

**Constraints**: Feedstock scarcity, chassis supply, actinic destabilization, feralization risk

**War Terrain**: Gates/assays, airworks, lamp stations, brace yards, actinic routes, **Covenant sovereignty**

**Timeline**: Saga 1 begins with rumors; ends with open conflict

---

## 8) Law and Papers (Neo-Noir Foundations)

### Paper Hierarchy
Pass Slips, Lamp Warrants, Hold Warrants, Air Certs, Quarantine Tags, Covenant Abstracts, Seal-Check Writs

### Core Laws
* **Blackout**: Extinguishing lamps = murder
* **Brace Sabotage**: Falsifying tags = mass endangerment
* **Quarantine (The Collar)**: Surface returns mandatory wash/inspection
* **Proving Charter**: Match legality inside yard; terrorism outside

### Receipt Culture
Every major action leaves visible receipt: stamps, marks, logs, traces
* Forgery = political power
* Archives = treasure
* Burns/erasures = crimes

---

## 9) Philosophy and Doctrine (Godless Religions)

**Foundation**: Survival is procedural and public; virtue is measurable

**Core Question**: *Who gets to decide what your body is for?*

**Nine Doctrines**:
1. **Receipt**: Proof outranks testimony
2. **Seal-Sober**: Drift is identity erosion
3. **Workhorse Hymn**: Body exists to carry load
4. **Ladder of Altitude**: Tier reflects what you can bear
5. **Actinic Pragmatists**: Courage measured in exposure minutes
6. **Unbroken School**: Design judged under pressure
7. **Plain Condition**: Legibility is ownership (unseeded sovereignty)
8. **Covenant Literalists**: Promises are sacred
9. **Threadist Heresy**: Keelkin fragments seeking reunion

**Clustering**: Doctrines cluster by tier (Crownwalks/Midworks/Sumpward/Underdecks)

**Weaponization**: Used to justify labor extraction, denial, monopoly, documentation control

---

## 10) Active Conflicts (Story Engines)

1. **Surface Procurement War**: Guilds vs. Free Crews vs. Runners over salvage
2. **Strain-Class System**: Clean elites vs. Workhorse laborers vs. Unseeded sovereignty
3. **Hollowing Crisis**: Writ-Doctors vs. Institutions vs. Victims over definition/use
4. **Golem Economy**: Architects vs. Labor guilds vs. Ethics advocates over construct status
5. **Deep Expedition Question**: Expeditions vs. Isolationists vs. Unknown over risk/reward

---

## 11) Tone and Aesthetic

**Era**: 1860s-1880s (steam, gas, brass, glass, stamped papers, boneglass, wire)

**No Futurist Register**: Avoid core/network/unit/system; use Office/Board/House/Works/Yard

**Mood**: Neo-noir (paperwork, gates, corruption) + Alien (ecology horror, procedure strangeness) + Industrial-occult medicine (bodies as infrastructure)

**Visual Signatures**:
* Seamwork on hands counting iron pills by lamplight
* Vertical cities with tier-segregated breathing
* Timed surface runs with visible equipment degradation
* Keelframe arena matches (living constructs)
* Free Crew ambushes stealing air
* Surface sky: amber-grey, wrong shadows, visible radiation
* Hollowed human harvested for power, blissful
* Writ-Doctor reading Keel-script scars
* Dream-bleed: spore-clouds and colony-mind
* Deep expedition finding the impossible

---

## 12) Practical Consistency Rules (Always-On)

* Keelkin follows Stabilize/Seal/Build based on conditions + Covenant
* Actinic suppresses Keelkin; actinic goods remain necessary
* Mods are projects with costs, inputs, time, maintenance
* Seal-Check is living verification with liveness constraints
* Keelframes are living scaffolds with bounded autonomy
* Arena is infrastructure warfare as sport
* Every major action leaves receipt
* Communication through 5 pathways
* Hollowing is 5 stages
* Power is dual economy (glowstock + Keel-Current + Deep-Source)
* Surface is timed runs with visible degradation
* Regeneration has limits (5 failure categories)

---

## 13) The Uniqueness Statement

**Orrovae is different from your other worlds because**:

* **NOT Selnara**: No Signal Pale compliance drift; horror is biological transformation, not behavioral corruption
* **NOT Halcova**: Fate isn't predetermined; horror is losing self through partnership, not predetermined worth
* **NOT Kitsahl**: No pre-crime; horror is body becoming unrecognizable, not future being measurable
* **Orrovae IS**: *The world where your power makes you confident until you meet something that can't be grown back from*
