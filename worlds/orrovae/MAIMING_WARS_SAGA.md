# THE MAIMING WARS — FIVE-BOOK SAGA STRUCTURE

**Status**: Planning Document v1.0

## SYMBIOTE RENAMING: KEELKIN → SÄIDESOLU

### Rationale

"Keelkin" does not follow any of the three established naming traditions in Orrovae:
- Germanic-Industrial (Guildtongue) - 50%
- Anglo-Saxon Revival (Oldblood) - 20%
- Finno-Ugric Hybrid (Hollowspeech/Sovereign-tongue) - 30%

The existing strain names (Hopeasäie, Rautajuuri, Valkosolmu, Püsiv, etc.) follow Finnish/Estonian patterns. The base symbiote name should match.

### Proposed Name: **Säidesolu** (Finnish: "Thread-Cell/Thread-Knot")

**Phonetic**: SAY-deh-SOH-loo

**Components**:
- *Säie* (säije) = thread, filament
- *Solu* = cell (also evokes *solmu* = knot)

**Why it works**:
- Follows established Finno-Ugric pattern in strain names
- Describes what the symbiote does: threads through fascia, forms knots
- Works as prefix: Säide-Current, Säide-Script, Säide-Reader
- The Hollowspeech/Sovereign-tongue tradition already uses Finnish roots

**Alternative (Germanic tradition)**: **Gewebknot** (GEH-veb-knot) - "Tissue-knot"
- Would work for Guildtongue speakers
- But strains already use Finnish, so consistency favors Säidesolu

### Derivative Terminology

| Current Term | New Term (Säidesolu) | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Keelkin | Säidesolu (säide for short) | Base symbiote name |
| Keel-Script | Säide-Script / Säijekiri | Scar-pattern communication |
| Keel-Current | Säide-Current / Säijevirta | Bioelectric power |
| Keel-Reader | Säide-Reader / Säijelukija | Medical diagnostic |
| Keelframe | Säideframe / Säijekehys | Construct chassis |
| Knot-Voice | Solmu-Voice / Solmuääni | Internal dialogue |
| Writ-Doctor | Säide-Writ / Säijarzt (Germanic) | Could stay "Writ-Doctor" |

**Note**: The population would use different terms based on tradition:
- Midworks (Germanic): Likely abbreviate to "Säide" or use Germanic compound
- Unseeded (Finno-Ugric): Full "Säidesolu" or affectionate "Säije"
- Crownwalk (Anglo-Saxon): May have archaic term or formal variant

## FIVEFOLD PHILOSOPHY INTEGRATION

### The Orrovae Interpretation

Orrovae adopted the Fivefold Philosophy millennia ago, but underground conditions have warped it. Each Facet has developed extreme interpretations:

### The Five Facets in Orrovae

| Facet | Golden Mean | Orrovae Distortion | Maiming Wars Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Ambition** | Stewarded drive | "Tier Climbing" - ruthless upward mobility justified as virtue | Drives those who weaponize Hollowing for power |
| **Imagination** | Responsible innovation | "Unbroken Doctrine" - design under pressure, innovation as survival | Justifies construct experimentation |
| **Community** | Mutuality | "Workhorse Hymn" - collective suffering is bonding; individuals owe the collective | Justifies using Hollowed as batteries, "for the community" |
| **Wisdom** | Guided intelligence | "Receipt Doctrine" - proof outranks testimony, bureaucratic manipulation | Allows horrors if paperwork is clean |
| **Fortitude** | Adaptive resilience | **THE BASTARDIZED DOCTRINE** (see below) | Central to Maiming Wars justification |

### The Bastardized Fortitude Doctrine: "The Unmaimed Return"

**Orthodox Fortitude** (Golden Mean):
> "Those who stand through the storm can shelter others."

**Bastardized Interpretation** (Orrovae mainstream):
> "Those who cannot stand do not deserve shelter."

**The Logic Chain**:
1. Fortitude means enduring hardship with resilience
2. The Säidesolu partnership allows recovery from almost anything
3. Therefore, those who "truly" possess Fortitude will survive and regenerate
4. Those who succumb to Hollowing lacked Fortitude—it was their Pattern's weakness
5. Those who are maimed beyond regeneration are "revealed" as low-Fortitude
6. Maiming is therefore a test, not a crime

**Doctrinal Sayings**:
- "The Säide knows your Pattern better than you do."
- "What the Säide cannot fix, you were never meant to keep."
- "Hollowing is the price of insufficient Fortitude."
- "Return-to-post, or reveal your Pattern."

### The Soul-Thread Doctrine (Reincarnation Beliefs)

**Core Belief**: The soul is a continuous thread (*sielulanka*) woven through multiple lifetimes. The Säidesolu is not just a symbiote—it carries fragments of past soul-threads and will carry yours forward.

**Three States of Departure**:

| State | What Happens | Soul-Thread Status | Cultural Response |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Clean Death** | Body dies, Säide dissolves, releases spores | Soul-thread released intact | Mourning, but acceptance. "The thread continues." |
| **Hollowing** | Säide becomes primary, human consciousness suppressed | Soul-thread consumed/absorbed | Horror. "The thread is devoured." The worst fate. |
| **Maiming** | Body damaged beyond Säide repair, consciousness persists | Soul-thread FRAYED | **Worse than death**. Soul enters next life damaged. |

**Why Maiming Is Worse Than Death**:

When you die cleanly, your soul-thread passes whole to the next life. When you Hollow, at least the thread is consumed entirely—the Säide carries some fragment forward. 

But when you are **maimed**—damaged beyond what the Säide can repair, yet survive—your soul-thread is *torn*. You live with a ragged soul. And when you finally die, that frayed thread passes forward, meaning your next life begins with:
- Damaged Pattern (harder to Balance)
- Susceptibility to Hollowing
- "Soul-debt" you didn't earn

**The Cruel Implication**: 
> "If you cannot heal from it, you should have died from it."

Mercy-killing the maimed is seen by some as an act of **Community** (protecting future selves) and **Wisdom** (recognizing when the thread is too damaged).

### The Five Shadow-Camps

Each Facet has developed extremist factions that weaponize the doctrine:

| Facet | Orthodox Camp | Shadow Camp | Maiming Wars Role |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Ambition | The Ladder (tier-climbing as virtue) | **The Cullers** - maiming enemies as "elevation" | Assassins, political maiming |
| Imagination | Unbroken (innovation as survival) | **The Shapers** - forcibly "improving" humans | Construct architects, body-horror experiments |
| Community | Workhorse Hymn (suffering bonds us) | **The Harvesters** - Hollowed as communal resource | Hollowing farms, power extraction |
| Wisdom | Receipt Doctrine (proof over testimony) | **The Ledgers** - documenting atrocities as "data" | War crimes bureaucrats |
| Fortitude | Return-to-post (endure, serve) | **The Unmaimed** - culling the "weak-threaded" | The Maiming Wars doctrine's true believers |

## SERIES IDENTITY

### Core Documentation

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Series Title** | THE MAIMING WARS |
| **Installment Count** | Five books (~100k+ each) |
| **Structure Type** | Lane-based (5 POV lanes, relay deaths) |
| **Genre** | Underground survival horror / Action-adventure / Body-horror |
| **Medium** | Novel series |
| **Tone** | Aliens franchise vibe - action-forward, claustrophobic, survival-focused |

### Series Premise

Ten thousand years after the Scouring drove humanity underground, civilization has stabilized into a brutally hierarchical system. The Säidesolu symbiote that allows regeneration has become the basis of power, class, and religion—but also the engine of atrocity. When competing factions begin weaponizing Hollowing, maiming becomes both weapon and political tool. As the underground tears itself apart, the surface creatures that evolved from humanity's surface-stranded ancestors begin probing the sealed gates with terrifying intelligence. By the time the factions realize their true enemy isn't each other, it may be too late. The surface is patient. The surface remembers. And the surface wants back in.

### Series-Level Thematic Question

> "What is owed to the body you will leave behind?"

Sub-questions by book:
- Book 1: Does regeneration make violence cheaper, or more expensive?
- Book 2: When healing becomes a weapon, who decides what you "deserve" to keep?
- Book 3: If the system uses bodies, can bodies revolt against the system?
- Book 4: What do you owe the enemy who was once human?
- Book 5: If the surface reclaims its children, was survival underground ever worth the cost?

### Resolution Direction: THE SURFACE WINS (Option 5)

**How this plays out**:
- The surface creatures aren't mindless—they're the descendants of surface-adapted humans
- They have their own Säidesolu strains, their own culture, their own memory of being abandoned
- The Maiming Wars weaken the underground so severely that surface incursion succeeds
- The "win" isn't genocide—it's reclamation
- Final image: The survivors of both populations learning that "winning" means neither side continues as they were
- The underground is opened; the surface is partially reclaimed; humanity reunifies but transformed

**Thematic Resonance**: 
The war over who deserves their body leads to losing the world. The surface creatures, who adapted rather than hid, ultimately prove the Fortitude doctrine's own logic—they endured, they changed, they returned.

## POV ARCHITECTURE

### POV Rules for This Series

- **Exactly 5 POV characters per book** (never more, never less while alive)
- **POVs can and will die** (relay mechanic: new POV inherits from dead POV's orbit)
- **No construct POVs** (they are Other, seen through human eyes)
- **No outright antagonist POVs** (antagonists act, protagonists respond)
- **One POV can survive the series** (but must be "dragged through the mud and beat up")

### The Five Lanes

| Lane | Focus | Starting POV | Relay Chain | Core Tension |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **A** | War Front | Soldier/mercenary | Combat personnel | Physical violence and its consequences |
| **B** | Medical/Power | Säide-Writ practitioner | Medical personnel | Healing as weapon, body ethics |
| **C** | Surface Work | Runner/Salvager | Surface operatives | Surface creatures, actinic reality |
| **D** | Unseeded | Plain Condition adherent | Unseeded community | Without Säide, what are you? |
| **E** | Authority/System | Guild bureaucrat | Those in power | Complicity, institutional horror |

### POV Naming (Conlang-Compliant)

Using the three naming traditions from `personal_names.md`:

| Lane | Name | Tradition | Meaning/Derivation | Tier/Status |
|------|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **A** | **Torven Grast** | Germanic-Industrial | Torven (sturdy + two-syllable masculine), Grast (occupation suffix) | Midworks, Workhorse-strain, mercenary company |
| **B** | **Sigerun Aelfsdottir** | Anglo-Saxon Revival | Sigerun (victory-secret/mystery), patronymic | Crownwalk, Clean-strain, Säide-Writ in training |
| **C** | **Kaisa Kalevin** | Finno-Ugric | Kaisa (Finnish feminine), Kalevin (patronymic "of Kalev") | Sumpward, mixed-strain, Runner |
| **D** | **Eneko Sovereign** | Finno-Ugric (Basque) | Eneko (Basque name), Sovereign (political marker) | Unseeded enclave, Plain Condition |
| **E** | **Helmar von Felsmark** | Germanic-Industrial | Helmar (helmet-famous), von Felsmark (noble suffix) | Midworks-to-Crownwalk climber, bureaucrat |

### Survivor Designation

**Kaisa Kalevin** (Lane C - Surface Runner) survives the series.

**Why Kaisa**:
- Surface work gives her the most contact with the "enemy"—she understands them
- Runner lifestyle means she's already beaten up constantly; the series escalates this
- Her Säide strain is mixed/workhorse—she's neither elite nor rejected
- She bridges worlds: underground/surface, seeded/unseeded (through Eneko)
- Her survival carries the "reunification" theme forward

**The "Beat Up" Requirement**:
By series end, Kaisa has:
- Lost multiple limbs (regrown with visible drift)
- Survived surface creature attack that killed her crew
- Killed her own Hollowing partner (Book 3)
- Been politically maimed (Book 4) and regenerated wrong
- Lost her voice (Säide rebuilt wrong) - communicates differently
- Watched Eneko die (Book 5)

Her final image: Standing at the opened gate, body a map of trauma, unable to speak, watching the surface creatures walk in—and recognizing one of them.

---

## RELAY MECHANICS

### How POV Relay Works

When a POV character dies, a character from their **orbit** (someone they interacted with significantly) becomes the new POV for that lane.

**Relay Rules**:
1. New POV must have appeared "on screen" before in that lane
2. New POV inherits the lane's thematic focus, not the character's exact role
3. Death must carry **narrative irony** (per template)
4. Relay character should have witnessed or been affected by the death

### Planned Relay Schedule

| Lane | Book 1 POV | Death (Book) | Book 2+ POV | Death (Book) | Final POV |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| **A** | Torven Grast | Book 2 (situational irony) | Kristen Halvard | Book 4 | Tavi Mwangi |
| **B** | Sigerun Aelfsdottir | Book 3 (tragic irony) | Vaska Lamphalt | Book 5 | Dies final book |
| **C** | Kaisa Kalevin | **SURVIVES** | — | — | Kaisa (damaged) |
| **D** | Eneko Sovereign | Book 5 (cosmic irony) | — | — | Dies protecting Kaisa |
| **E** | Helmar von Felsmark | Book 1 (dramatic irony) | Gritta Sealkeeper | Book 3 | Aino Okonkwo-Lehti |

### Death Irony Planning

| Character | Type of Irony | Setup | Execution |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **Helmar** (Book 1) | Dramatic | Reader knows the document he's filing will expose him; he doesn't | Files his own execution warrant, discovered before he can flee |
| **Torven** (Book 2) | Situational | Mercenary survives impossible combat; defines self by survival | Dies in infirmary from infection his Säide can't reach (ironic after battlefield survival) |
| **Sigerun** (Book 3) | Tragic | Her strength is precision healing; she saves hundreds | Over-extends saving construct victims; her own Säide turns on her (Hollowing) |
| **Gritta** (Book 3) | Cosmic | Bureaucrat tries to reform system from inside | System uses her own documentation protocols to condemn her |
| **Kristen** (Book 4) | Dramatic | Believes she's found a way to end the war | Her "solution" is a trap; she's sacrificed by both sides |
| **Aino** (Book 5) | N/A | Survives but traumatized | Becomes archivist of the reconciliation |
| **Vaska** (Book 5) | Tragic | Final Säide-Writ standing; refuses to weaponize healing | Dies healing a surface creature who couldn't consent to treatment |
| **Eneko** (Book 5) | Cosmic | Unseeded leader; believed purity would protect his people | Killed by humans, not surface creatures; dies proving tribalism failed |

## SERIES ARC ARCHITECTURE

### Five-Book Structure (Five-Part Model)

Each book = one part of the macro-story, while also having internal 5-part structure:

| Book | Macro Function | Maiming Wars Focus | Construct Focus | Surface Focus |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Book 1** | SETUP | War begins: first weaponized Hollowing incidents | Background: constructs as tools | Distant threat mentioned |
| **Book 2** | COMPLICATION | War escalates: maiming becomes doctrine | Rising: construct "glitches" noted | Probing attacks on outer gates |
| **Book 3** | CRISIS/MIDPOINT | War peaks: all factions committed | EMERGENCE: construct rebellion begins | Gates breached in multiple locations |
| **Book 4** | DARK NIGHT | War collapses both sides | Constructs as third faction | Surface incursions constant |
| **Book 5** | RESOLUTION | Maiming Wars end (no winners) | Constructs choose sides | Surface wins (reunification) |

### Tension Architecture

```
Book 1: ████████░░░░ (70% - Setup, establishing dread)
Book 2: ██████████░░ (85% - Escalation, major losses)
Book 3: ████████████ (100% - Peak war + construct emergence)
Book 4: ███████████░ (95% - Collapse, dark night)
Book 5: ████████████ → ████░░░░ (100% peak → 40% resolution)
```

---

## THEMATIC ARCHITECTURE

### Progression

| Book | Thematic Focus | Question Posed | Answer Suggested | Complication |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Violence & Healing | "Does regeneration make violence cheaper?" | "No—it makes it more creative" | Introduces weaponized Hollowing |
| 2 | Body Ownership | "Who decides what you deserve to keep?" | "Power decides" | Maiming as political tool |
| 3 | Personhood | "If bodies are systems, can systems rebel?" | "Yes, and they're angry" | Construct consciousness |
| 4 | Tribalism | "What do you owe the enemy?" | "More than you owe your tribe" | Surface creatures were us |
| 5 | Identity | "What survives transformation?" | "Only what we share" | Reunification |

### Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis (Macro Level)

**Books 1-2 (Thesis)**: The underground system works. Hierarchy, Säidesolu, doctrine—these survived the Scouring. The surface is death.

**Books 3-4 (Antithesis)**: The system is self-destroying. Doctrine justifies atrocity. The surface isn't death—it's adaptation we refused.

**Book 5 (Synthesis)**: Survival requires transformation. Neither underground rigidity nor surface wilderness is the answer. Integration transforms both.

## SETUP/PAYOFF ENGINEERING

### Series-Level Setups

| Setup | Planted | Type | Payoff | Satisfaction |
|-------|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| Surface creatures arrange corpses in patterns | Book 1 (Kaisa scene) | Information | Book 5: It's language; they've been trying to talk | "They were always people" |
| Sigerun's mentor warns about "thread-debt" | Book 1 (Lane B) | Thematic | Book 3: Sigerun's Hollowing is thread-debt collecting | Foreshadowed tragedy |
| Construct "glitch" reports dismissed | Book 1 (background) | Pattern | Book 3: Glitches were awakening | Reader "saw it coming" |
| Kaisa spared by surface creature | Book 2 (Lane C) | Relationship | Book 5: The creature recognized her grandmother's seamwork | Emotional gut-punch |
| Eneko's vision of reunification | Book 1 (Lane D) | Thematic | Book 5: He dies before seeing it; Kaisa lives to see it wrong | Tragic irony |
| Soul-thread doctrine (maiming worse than death) | Book 1 (cultural) | Thematic | Book 5: Surface creatures don't believe this; they changed | Doctrine was wrong |

### Motif Tracking

| Motif | Book 1 | Book 2 | Book 3 | Book 4 | Book 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Seamwork/Scars** | Identity markers | Weapons/stigma | Communication | Maps of trauma | Shared heritage |
| **Threads** | Soul-thread doctrine | Fraying (war) | Breaking | Severed | Rewoven |
| **Gates/Doors** | Sealed | Reinforced | Breached | Collapsed | Opened |
| **Light** | Glowstock underground | Actinic threat | Both dangerous | Darkness | Dawn (surface sun returned) |
| **Voice** | Speech/doctrine | Screaming | Silence | Translation | Understanding |

---

## ANTAGONIST ARCHITECTURE

### Series Antagonist: The Doctrine Itself

There is no single villain. The antagonist is the **system of beliefs** that:
- Treats bodies as infrastructure
- Weaponizes healing
- Measures worth by survival
- Sees the surface as purely enemy

**Manifestations by Book**:

| Book | Antagonist Manifestation | Actions |
|------|-------------------------|---------|
| 1 | The faction that first weaponizes Hollowing | Assassinates political figure via induced Hollowing |
| 2 | "The Unmaimed" doctrine movement | Codifies maiming as acceptable political tool |
| 3 | All factions—nobody innocent | War crimes across all sides |
| 4 | Underground hardliners | Refuse negotiation, punish Kaisa for contact |
| 5 | The last believers in separation | Kill Eneko, attempt to close gates forever |

### Named Antagonist Figures (Not POVs)

| Name | Tradition | Role | Book Arc |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Cynewulf Bracebreaker** | Anglo-Saxon | "Unmaimed" doctrine leader | Books 2-4 (dies Book 4) |
| **Vestor the Harvester** | Germanic | Hollowing-farm operator | Books 1-3 (killed by constructs) |
| **Satu Ironthread** | Finno-Ugric | Construct architect who goes too far | Books 2-4 (defects to surface) |
| **The Solmuhaamu** | Finno-Ugric | Surface creature leader ("Knot-Ghost") | Books 3-5 (negotiates peace) |

---

## FACTION SUMMARY

### Underground Factions (Pre-War)

| Faction | Doctrine | War Position | Fate |
|---------|----------|--------------|------|
| The Ladder (Ambition) | Tier-climbing | Opportunist (profit from war) | Discredited Book 4 |
| The Unmaimed (Fortitude) | Culling weak | Aggressor (starts maiming doctrine) | Destroyed Book 5 |
| The Harvesters (Community) | Hollowed as resource | "Defensive" (claims necessity) | Collapses Book 3 |
| The Ledgers (Wisdom) | Documentation | "Neutral" (enables all sides) | Exposed Book 4 |
| The Shapers (Imagination) | Body as design | Arms dealers (sell to everyone) | Split Book 3 (some join surface) |
| Plain Condition (Unseeded) | Without Säide | Neutral → victims | Scattered Book 4 |

### Surface Faction

**The Returned** (*Paluuvaki*):
- Descendants of surface-stranded humans from post-Scouring
- Developed actinic-tolerant Säidesolu strains
- 10,000 years of parallel evolution
- Remember being abandoned
- Want reunion, not conquest
- Will use force if negotiation refused

---

## PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK NOTES

### How Fivefold Manifests

**Ambition**: 
- Positive: Torven's drive to protect clients; Sigerun's drive to heal
- Negative: Helmar's tier-climbing that starts the war

**Imagination**: 
- Positive: Kaisa's translation attempts; construct awakening
- Negative: Shapers' body-horror experiments

**Community**:
- Positive: Eneko's vision of Unseeded solidarity
- Negative: "Workhorse Hymn" justifying Hollowing farms

**Wisdom**:
- Positive: Aino's documentation for future generations
- Negative: Receipt Doctrine enabling atrocity-by-paperwork

**Fortitude**:
- Positive: Kaisa surviving everything; Vaska dying for principles
- Negative: "The Unmaimed" doctrine (central villain)

### The Reincarnation Twist

Surface creatures don't believe in soul-thread doctrine. They believe consciousness transforms but doesn't persist. This means:
- They don't fear maiming the same way
- They adapted rather than preserved
- Their doctrine (implicit) is: "What you become is what you are"

Underground's doctrine was: "What you were born as is what you must remain."

The series argues: Neither is fully right. What you become is shaped by what you were. Reunion requires accepting transformation without erasing history.

## WRITING REQUIREMENTS

Per `default.v2.md` and `story_structure_and_rules.md`:

### Voice
- Abercrombie/Weeks/Martin/Pizzolatto fusion
- Dark humor mandatory (2-3 moments per POV section)
- Sensory immersion before emotional access
- No exposition dumps—earn every revelation

### Structure
- 5-part structure per book
- Scene cards track: escalation, setup/payoff, motif, theoretical concept
- Stakes must escalate externally AND internally
- Every antagonist action gets protagonist response

### Deaths
- Must carry narrative irony
- Must be earned (reader should feel it was "fair" even if painful)
- Relay characters must have appeared before

### Action-Forward
- Aliens franchise vibe: always moving, always hunted
- Claustrophobic tension in underground scenes
- Vast hostile openness in surface scenes
- Combat is visceral and consequential (no easy regeneration)

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. [ ] Confirm symbiote rename across canon (Keelkin → Säidesolu)
2. [ ] Develop detailed Book 1 outline with scene cards
3. [ ] Create character profiles for all 5 starting POVs
4. [ ] Build relay character profiles (at least sketch)
5. [ ] Map construct rebellion subplot details
6. [ ] Develop surface creature culture/language
