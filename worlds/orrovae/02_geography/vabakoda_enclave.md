## OVERVIEW

**Vabakoda** (*Estonian: "Free-Home"*) is the largest Unseeded enclave in the Korrgate Hold system—approximately 8,000 residents living without Säidesolu partnership. It serves as the primary setting for Lane D (Eneko Sovereign) scenes throughout the Maiming Wars saga.

```

**Why Underdeck?**
Spore density in Underdeck is extremely high—constant exposure would seed any unprotected human within weeks. This is actually *advantageous* for Vabakoda: the environment is so hostile to unseeded that no seeded person would live there voluntarily. The Unseeded claimed unwanted space.

### The Sealed District

Vabakoda occupies a former industrial sector (abandoned textile processing) that was hermetically sealed against spore infiltration. Key features:

**Air Handling**:
- Four-stage filtration removing 99.97% of spores
- Positive pressure prevents infiltration
- Emergency backup generators for ventilation
- Constant maintenance requirement

**Entry Protocols**:
- Decontamination airlocks at all entrances
- UV sterilization (damages spores)
- Chemical wash stations
- 24-hour quarantine for new arrivals

## GOVERNANCE

### The Council of Seven

Vabakoda is governed by a council of seven elected leaders, each responsible for a critical function:

| Position | Current Holder | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Spokesman** | Eneko Sovereign | External relations, advocacy |
| **Warden** | Maret Kõiv | Security, entry protocols |
| **Steward** | Toomas Pärt | Resource management, trade |
| **Keeper** | Liis Tamm | Air systems, environmental |
| **Elder** | Anu Sepp | Disputes, tradition |
| **Healer** | Juhan Rebane | Medical (without Säide) |
| **Youth** | Piret Võsa | Education, next generation |

**Election Process**:
- All adults (16+) vote
- Three-year terms, staggered
- No term limits
- Recall by 2/3 majority

**Decision Making**:
- Routine matters: Majority vote
- Major decisions: 5/7 supermajority
- Existential matters: Full community assembly

### Eneko's Position

**Title**: Spokesman (*Kõneisik*)

**Responsibilities**:
- Represents Vabakoda to external authorities
- Negotiates with seeded population
- Advocates for Unseeded rights
- Manages intelligence about external threats

**Authority**:
Limited—Eneko speaks *for* Vabakoda but cannot bind it. Major decisions return to the Council. This creates tension when rapid response is needed.

**Political Style**:
Patient, persuasive, principled. Eneko believes in winning through demonstration—showing that Unseeded communities can thrive, thereby undermining anti-Unseeded rhetoric.

---

## POPULATION

### Demographics

**Total Population**: ~8,000
**Age Distribution**:
- Children (0-15): 22%
- Working Adults (16-55): 61%
- Elders (56+): 17%

**Origin Mix**:
- Born Unseeded (never seeded): 45%
- De-seeded (Säide died, survived): 12%
- Rejected (immune to seeding): 18%
- Voluntary abstainers (refused seeding): 25%

### The Four Groups

**The Born** (*Sündinu*):
Children of Unseeded parents, raised in the enclave. They've never known Säide partnership. Constitute growing majority.

**The Widowed** (*Lesed*):
Lost their Säide to disease, poison, or violence. Survived the separation trauma. Often carry psychological scars. Some still dream of phantom Säide.

**The Refused** (*Keeldunud*):
Genetic incompatibility prevents seeding. No choice in the matter. Some bitter, some relieved.

**The Chosen** (*Valitud*):
Deliberately refused seeding despite compatibility. Most controversial group—seen as "wasting" opportunity by seeded society. Often the most ideologically committed.

---

## DAILY LIFE

### Economy

**Internal Production**:
- Manual textile work (original industrial heritage)
- Precision crafts (no Säide means no regeneration; must work carefully)
- Food processing (filtered, sterilized)
- Air system maintenance (critical skill)

**External Trade**:
- Expertise in spore-free environments
- Manual labor for environments too spore-dangerous for seeded workers
- Information and translation services
- Messenger services (Unseeded can travel through contaminated areas safely)

**Currency**:
Vabakoda uses standard Hold currency but maintains internal credit system for community work.

### Social Structure

**Families**:
Extended family clusters share residence blocks. Childcare is communal—children belong to the community.

**Marriage**:
Unions formalized before Council. No Säide blessing means no Thread-Memory inheritance concerns—marriages are purely about the individuals.

**Death**:
Without Säide to carry impressions forward, the Unseeded developed strong memorial traditions. Names are carved in the Hall of Names. Stories told at annual Remembering festivals. Death is final—and therefore precious.

### Medicine Without Säide

**The Healer's Challenge**:
No regeneration means injuries must heal naturally. Surgery is risky. Infection is dangerous. Life expectancy is lower than seeded population (average 62 vs. 78).

**Compensation Strategies**:
- Emphasis on prevention (careful work, protective equipment)
- Herbal/chemical medicine knowledge preserved from pre-Säide era
- Bone-setting, wound-stitching, other manual techniques
- Acceptance of mortality (death is not failure)

**The Juhan Rebane Approach**:
Current Healer has developed extensive pharmacopeia. His medications don't rival Säide healing but provide real relief. He's sought after by seeded patients whose Säide can't help certain conditions.

---

## CULTURE AND BELIEFS

### Plain Condition Philosophy

The Unseeded reject Säide partnership as:
- **Dependency** | "They never learn to stand alone."
- **Identity erosion** | "Where do they end and their Säide begin?"
- **Hollowing risk** | "We face death. They face something worse."
- **Thread-Memory concern** | "They carry the dead inside them. We carry only ourselves."

**The Core Belief**:
> "A human being is sufficient. We need no partner to complete us. Our pain is our own. Our death is our own. Our lives are our own."

### The Three Principles

**1. Sufficiency** (*Piisavus*)
> "What I am is enough."

The human body, unaugmented, is capable and worthy. No enhancement needed.

**2. Clarity** (*Selgus*)
> "My thoughts are my own."

No dream-bleed, no resonance, no Thread-Memory confusion. Pure individual identity.

**3. Dignity** (*Väärikus*)
> "My death belongs to me."

No Hollowing. Death is final, personal, and sacred. Better to die whole than live fractured.

### Religious Expression

The Unseeded have adapted Fivefold Philosophy:

**Fortitude**: Enduring without regeneration—"True Fortitude needs no crutch."
**Ambition**: Achieving despite limitation—"Our mountains are higher."
**Community**: Mutual dependence (no Säide to rely on)—"We are each other's healing."
**Wisdom**: Learning from mortality—"Death makes every day precious."
**Imagination**: Creating without Säide assistance—"Our art is purely human."

### Festivals

**The Remembering** (Annual)
Reading of all names lost in the past year. Stories told. No one is forgotten.

**Sufficiency Day** (Annual)
Celebration of what humans can do without Säide. Athletic competitions, craft exhibitions, feasting.

**The Choosing** (When needed)
When someone chooses to leave Vabakoda for seeding, the community holds ritual of release. Sad but accepting—"They choose their path."

## EXTERNAL RELATIONS

### With Korrgate Hold Authority

**Legal Status**: Recognized minority community
**Rights**: Limited self-governance, protected from forced seeding
**Obligations**: Pay taxes (reduced rate), contribute to Hold defense
**Tensions**: Constant pressure to accept "normalization" (seeding programs)

### With The Unmaimed

**Status**: Below Hollowed in Unmaimed hierarchy
**Threat Level**: Existential

The Unmaimed view Unseeded as:
- "Pattern cowards" (refusing to test their Pattern)
- "Thread parasites" (benefiting from society without contributing to Thread)
- "Acceptable losses" (not even worth Hollowing—just elimination)

**Unmaimed Position on Vabakoda**:
> "They claim self-sufficiency. Let them prove it—outside the Hold's protection."

### With Other Factions

**The Harvesters**: Sometimes hire Unseeded for dangerous work (expendable labor)
**The Ledgers**: Document Vabakoda as "administrative anomaly"
**The Shapers**: Occasionally interested in Unseeded for "control group" experiments
**The Reformers**: Potential allies—share interest in stopping The Unmaimed
