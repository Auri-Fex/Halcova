# KORRGATE

## Overview

**Type**: Major Hold (Tier 1 city)
**Population**: ~180,000 permanent residents
**Location**: Level 2 (Civic), 400-700m depth
**Governance**: Dual system (Lantern Council + Brace Assembly)
**Economic Focus**: Political center, administrative hub, balanced economy
**Distinguishing Feature**: Equilibrium - no single faction dominates completely

**Elevator Pitch**: Korrgate is where Orrovae's contradictions meet but don't resolve. Progressive Lantern reformers clash with conservative Brace traditionalists in endless political theater, while ordinary people navigate the compromise and corruption that results. It's stable, prosperous, and deeply frustrating to everyone who lives there.

### How It Works (Theoretically)

**Separation of Powers**:
- Lantern handles economy
- Brace handles society
- Neither can act without other's consent on major issues

**Required Consensus** (Both Must Agree):
- Taxation changes
- Major infrastructure
- Gate policy
- Foreign treaties
- Constitutional amendments

**Individual Authority**:
- Lantern: Can regulate markets, approve business, manage trade
- Brace: Can enforce laws, run courts, maintain security

**Deadlock Resolution**:
- Referendum (rare - requires 2/3 citizen petition)
- Compromise (usual - backroom deals)
- Crisis override (emergency powers - never used successfully)

---

### How It Works (Actually)

**Constant Conflict**:
- Every decision contested
- Rival factions obstruct each other
- Personal feuds institutionalized
- Progress glacial

**Backroom Deals**:
- Official votes theatrical
- Real decisions made privately
- Corruption endemic
- Favors traded constantly

**Popular Frustration**:
- Citizens exhausted by political drama
- "Both sides the same" (cynicism)
- Low engagement (except elections)
- Underground alternatives (Underdeck autonomy)

**Advantages** (Despite dysfunction):
- No tyranny (power divided)
- No civil war (conflict channeled)
- Stability (predictable gridlock)
- Multiple access points (citizens can petition either side)

**Foreign Perception**:
- Model of compromise (admired)
- Or: Paralyzed mess (pitied)
- Depends on observer's values
