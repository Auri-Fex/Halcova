# ORROVAE — WORLD BIBLE (Live Canon, Updated)

## 0) Thematic Story Spine

**Axis 1 — Power/Cost**: *"Every miracle has a supply chain. Every body keeps a ledger."*

Power in Orrovae is never free. Healing consumes mass and chemistry. Strain-class writes poverty on bodies. Hollowing is the ultimate invoice.

**Axis 2 — Rebellion/Empire**: *"Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership."*

Empire is extraction dressed as infrastructure. Every chokepoint is a throne. Rebellion arises when bounded autonomy discovers the system requires its consumption.

**Central Question**: Who decides what your body is for?

See `01_story_spine/thematic_core.md` for complete thematic architecture.

## 0.1) Canon Lock Index

This document incorporates all current locked canon for Orrovae, including:

**Setting + economy**

* Underground civilization beneath the Ruinfield surface; trade and power run through chokepoint corridors called the  **Lanes** .
* Core theme: survival as chosen dependency; bodies and infrastructure are priced, regulated, and exploited through institutions.
* **Thematic expression**: Every lane is a toll. Every gate is a throne. Power/Cost manifests as passage fees; Rebellion/Empire manifests as who controls the chokepoints.

**“Magic”**

* “Magic” = **Keelkin** symbiote partner enabling accelerated regeneration via **Covenant** settings; healing is effective, body-horror, leaves receipts (seamwork, shedding, drift).

**Acquisition**

* Keelkin is **not innate** at birth for most; typically acquired later through regulated or illicit **seeding** requiring consent, supplies, inspection.
* Rare congenital **wild-seeded** cases exist; medically and politically volatile.

**Subsistence**

* Survival is supported by industrial biosphere farming: **Spore Houses** run vats, trays, filter beds, bleach beds; bin-raised crawlstock; trough-raised shellstock/gelstock; large “meat” rare luxury.
* Keelkin can synthesize some vitamins/cofactors (C/K/B complex) and improves recycling efficiency; it cannot create elements; minerals/electrolytes and essential fats remain scarce inputs.

**Surface paradox**

* **Actinic** surface exposure suppresses/destabilizes Keelkin regeneration.
* **Actinic goods** (sun-cured salts/resins/membranes/sterile ash) are economically necessary underground.

**Identity**

* Cities use Keelkin-based **Seal-Check** (Keelseal/Knotprint) as living verification readable by Seal Houses; includes liveness constraints; dark implication: coercion/forced verification and class signaling via “clean” vs “rough” readings.

**Modification**

* Keelkin regeneration can be guided by Covenant + clinic-grade patterning:
  * cosmetic variance
  * adaptive functional mods (with tradeoffs)
  * rare high-risk architectural changes (extra limbs) requiring major resources/time and carrying long-term costs
  * constrained by input scarcity and actinic goods economy

**Expansions**

* Symbiote-bearing biota exists underground; rare actinic-tolerant feral strains make surface procurement predatory.
* A meaningful unseeded minority exists (not inherently criminal) trading regeneration for privacy/bodily sovereignty/surface resilience.
* Caste system primarily based on Keelkin strain-classes readable via Seal-Check (clean/workhorse/feral/specialty).
* Keelkin-housed constructs ( **Keelframes** ) exist: living scaffold + bounded Covenant task-oaths enabling constrained autonomy; high cost/risk; heavily regulated and illicitly traded.

**Arena + saga lock**

* A sanctioned arena institution evolved from civic proving yards into a complex, spectator “game” where **Keelframes** are the on-field combatants and the celebrities are the **coaches/architects/engineers** who design and train them.
* The arena’s selection pressure and the symbiote caste economy seed a saga-scale conflict: **The Construct Rebellion** — not primarily “people were mean,” but a systemic break driven by strain exploitation, input throttling, and adaptive autonomy.
* Humans originally participated; later replaced by Keelframes as “modernization.” Human participation persists in punitive/illegal “freedom brackets.”
* Keelframes can regenerate their living scaffold with the right nutrients; rigid skeletal/hardware components are repaired/replaced, not regrown, at scale.

---

## 1) Tone, Era, and Naming Constraints

### 1.1 Technology and vernacular baseline

* Era feel:  **1860s–1880s** . Steam, gas, oil, chain lifts, mechanical pumps, stamped papers, brass instruments, glass slips, seal-paste, iron-gall inks, boneglass, wire, rivets, treated timber, ropebone cordage.
* No futurist register. Avoid terms like *core, network, unit, system* in-world. Use Office/Board/Commission/Company/Trust/House/Works/Yard/Service/Constabulary/Guild.

### 1.2 Mood

* Neo-noir: paperwork, power at gates, bribery, shortages, black markets, predation dressed as commerce.
* Alien: biota and medicine are non-Earth; strangeness comes from ecology + procedure, not shiny tech.
* Industrial-occult medicine: bodies as infrastructure; healing as a regulated commodity.

### 1.3 Three-register naming (mandatory)

Any institution, place, or process of consequence carries:

1. **Formal stamped name**
2. **Trade-painted name**
3. **Street cant**

---

## 2) The World at a Glance

### 2.1 The split world

* **Ruinfield (surface):** lethal, economically necessary frontier. Short salvage/procurement runs; settlement is a compounding failure.
* **Underdark (civilization):** the Lanes and their hubs — braced corridors, lift cities, lamp stations, culture caverns.

### 2.2 The power principle

Power concentrates where:

* tunnel narrows,
* air must be swapped,
* structure must be trusted,
* water is controlled,
* quarantine is enforced,
* identity is checked.

---

## 3) Geography and Infrastructure

### 3.1 The Surface: Ruinfield

**Function:** salvage frontier + actinic refinery + contamination source.

**Core hazards (operational)**

* **Actinic exposure:** suppresses/destabilizes Keelkin behavior; increases misbuild and fever susceptibility; pushes Keelkin toward shutdown/triage states.
* **Exposure-based contamination:** persistent hazards embed/bind; exposure accumulates. Healing closes damage but does not erase exposure.
* **Structural collapse:** ruins fail unpredictably; settlement demands bracing on a scale rivaling underground maintenance.
* **Water wrongness:** surface runoff is chemically aggressive; it ruins containers, tools, membranes, and culture goods.

**Surface time discipline**

* Surface work is timed, tethered, logged, and followed by quarantine on return.

### 3.2 The Underdark: The Lanes

**Function:** trade corridors and the only sustainable habitat.

**Lane types**

* Caravan tunnels; fissure runs; spore corridors; void spans; lift shafts.

**Stations**

* Lamp stations; airworks posts; span posts.

### 3.3 Underdark Settlement Model

* **Underways/Lanes** are the primary intercity network; travel is engineered corridors with rules, bracework, lantern posts, air-handling, and posted procedures.
* **Excavation as statecraft:** new districts are “won” by cut/shore/seal/vent; expansion is political and audited.
* **Settlement size ladder (capped, not mega-metropolis):** Lay-by/Stop → Hamlet/Relay → Hold/Wardtown → Cavern City → High Seat (largest, still capped).
* **Waystations** exist along travel tunnels as real logistics stops (air/water/food culture exchange, permits, quarantine leverage).

### 3.4 Stack-Cities (Vertical Cavern Urbanism)

* Cities rise up into cavern space and expand down into underdecks (basement districts).
* **Compartment logic / “station feel”:** seal-gates, tier permits, isolation during breach/riot/audit; life-support is managed per tier.
* **Vertical zoning pattern:** Crownwalks / Midworks / Sumpward / Underdecks.
* **Transit:** hoist towers, brace-stairs, net bridges; tier-specific access is a major control vector.
* **Story consequence lock:** class is altitude + access; politics are seal-based; conflict is three-dimensional.


## 4) Scarcity Engines (the real “currency”)

---

## 13A) Bracefaith (Ideology Engine for the Maiming Wars)

* **Bracefaith / Proving / Hard Mercy** as a doctrine that frames maiming + conditional repair as “strengthening” and “faithfulness.”
* **Operational virtues:** Resilience, Fortitude, Endurance defined as measurable metrics (return-to-function, compliance under restriction, output under ration).
* **Proving Ladder:** Restriction → Correction (maiming) → Repair (conditional nutrients/clinic) → Bond (Covenant settings) → Receipt (classification).
* **Missionary framing:** “make them faithful/fit” used to justify conversion wars and compartment coercion.
* **Institutional carriers:** Lantern Guild, Bracewrights, Writ-Doctors, Seal-Houses, Spore Houses (nutrients as sacrament).
* **Key twist:** the doctrine sometimes “works,” creating sincere believers and moral complexity.

Orrovae’s economy is built on controllable necessities:

* Light, air, water, food, structure, maps, actinic goods, repair inputs.

Money exists; **breath and passage** remain the deeper unit.


## 5) Institutions and Factions (Formal / Trade / Street)

---

## 15A) Helmeted Enforcement (Faceless Procedure)

* **Helm Patrol** concept: helmeted soldiers used for patrol, gate law, closures, quarantine enforcement, escorting “corrections.”
* Helmets justified by spore/air hazards, anonymity as policy, and verification asymmetry.
* Standard kit concepts: latch tools, lantern lines, chalk/stamps, procedural receipts; not “sci-fi cops,” but industrial/occult-medical bureaucracy.

## 15B) Rural Guardians / Construct Enforcement Anchors

* **Ward-Frames** (guardian constructs) placed at chokepoints, relays, membrane rooms, underdeck bypass mouths—fixed-site security, not universal patrol.
* **Bounded autonomy:** task-oathed, boring, procedural; paired with a clerk/warden because paperwork matters.
* Risk/implication: forgotten mandates, use as Bracefaith instruments, and the “procedural refusal” seed for rebellion (world-level possibility, not plot).

### 5.1 Light authority

* **Formal:** *Board of Lamps & Passage*
* **Trade:** *Lampworks*
* **Street:** *Wick Men / Lamplords*

### 5.2 Structural authority

* **Formal:** *Commission of Span & Load*
* **Trade:** *Spanworks Yard*
* **Street:** *Load Men*

### 5.3 Food and sanitation economy

* **Formal:** *Office of Mycological Provision*
* **Trade:** *Culture Houses*
* **Street:** *Spore Barons*

### 5.4 Symbiote medicine and Covenant drafting

* **Formal:** *Covenant Office of Repair* (Seal House charter)
* **Trade:** *Seal House Clinics*
* **Street:** *Knot Docs / Seamwrights*

### 5.5 Surface salvage authority

* **Formal:** *Surface Recovery Service*
* **Trade:** *Ruinmouth Yard*
* **Street:** *Runners / Up-Rats*

### 5.6 Pirates

* **Street:** *Free Crews / Lane Wolves*

Targets: light, air, food cultures, maps, braces, actinic goods, repair rations, and sometimes living bearers for coerced Seal-Checks.

### 5.7 Arena authority (new, locked)

The arena is a civic institution that became sport.

* **Formal:** *Commission of Proving & Charter*
* **Trade:** *The Proving Yards*
* **Street:** *The Pits / The Boards / The Yard*

Controls:

* match charters, safety boundaries, map configurations, sanctioned emplacements, rebuild windows, and the licensing of frame architects.


## 6) Law and Papers (Lane Law Packet Canon)

---

## 21A) Neo-Noir Pirate Adventure (Genre Lock)

* Orrovae supports a **Neo-Noir Pirate Adventure** mode: piracy = stealing survival infrastructure + the paperwork that moves it.
* “Spice” analogue = actinic goods + critical inputs (minerals/electrolytes/essential fats) plus authoring rights (waivers, exemptions, inspection authority).
* Heist logic is bottleneck logic: hoists, gates, air compartments, route maps; every job leaves a receipt.

## 21B) Proof/Receipt Scaffolding (World Principle)

* Reinforced world rule: **every major action leaves a visible receipt** (stamped permits, seal-check results, closure postings, term-sheets, ration tags, air-draw logs, chalked brace marks).
* This is partly tone, partly world logic—worth listing explicitly as an “always-on” storytelling/world coherence principle.

## 21C) 5-Lane POV Schema (Project Structure)

* **Five POV lanes (roles):** Case Spine / Crew-Logistics / Pact-Clinic / Authority / Outsider-Edge.
* **Saga flow loop:** Rumor → Run → Clamp → Care → Chain (each handoff carries a receipt baton).
* (If your World Bible avoids story scaffolds, put this in a “Series Bible / Story Engine” section instead.)

### 6.1 The paper hierarchy

Pass Slips, Lamp Warrants, Hold Warrants, Air Certs, Quarantine Tags, Covenant Abstracts, Seal-Check writs.

### 6.2 Blackout law

Extinguishing another’s lamp on declared hazard stretches is prosecuted as attempted murder or worse.

### 6.3 Brace sabotage law

Falsifying brace tags is mass endangerment; often capital in practice.

### 6.4 Quarantine law (the Collar)

All surface returns pass through wash, inspection, breath check, culture check.

### 6.5 Proving Charter law (new)

The Commission grants:

* **Proving Charters** (legal authority to field frames in sanctioned yards),
* **Architect Licenses** (patterning rights),
* **Emplacement Permits** (limited defensive constructions),
* **Wager Prohibitions** (officially) and “regulated pools” (unofficially ubiquitous).

Match law treats sabotage differently inside vs outside the yard:

* inside the yard: permitted within charter boundaries
* outside the yard: prosecuted as lane terrorism

---

## 7) Economy Ledger Canon (Tokens and Supply Chains)

### 7.1 Practical tokens

Ration Chits, Lamp-Stamps, Hold-Marks.

### 7.2 Backbone chains

Light chain; air chain; food chain; structure chain; Covenant chain.

### 7.3 Arena economy (new)

The arena concentrates:

* patronage contracts (lamp charters, brace works, convoy rights),
* prestige (architect demand),
* illicit trade (strain vials, specialty feed, black patterning),
* recruitment (crew scouts and Free Crew poachers).

Winning is not just glory; winning moves real infrastructure contracts.

---

## 8) Subsurface Subsistence Model (Spore Houses, Air, Water)

### 8.1 Calorie reality

Surface imports + deep chemotroph feeders + closed-loop waste cycling.

### 8.2 Spore House industrial farming

Vats (protein), trays (calories), filter beds (air membranes), bleach beds (antiseptics).

### 8.3 Protein sources

Cultured sheets/curds; crawlstock; shellstock; gelstock. Large meat rare.

### 8.4 Air and water as property

Membranes/canisters guarded; cistern rights enforced; contamination discipline constant.

### 8.5 Cannibalism non-viability (biological rule)

Self-consumption fails as strategy due to element scarcity, losses, overhead, contamination risk, and Keelkin austerity behavior.

---

## 9) Biota (Non-Earth) — Symbiote-bearing Expansion (Updated)

### 9.1 Baseline biota principle

Orrovae biota is not Earth-derived. It is categorized by civic function and hazard management: glowstock, breathers, feeders, binders, bleachers, feverers.

### 9.2 Symbiote-bearing biota (new, locked)

Keelkin-like symbiotes exist beyond humans.

**Underground**

* Predators and pests can be symbiote-bearing, creating:
  * self-sealing attack behavior (hard to bleed out),
  * scar-armor thickening over time,
  * fever-carrying reservoirs that survive what would kill ordinary hosts.

**Surface**

* Rare **actinic-tolerant feral strains** exist. These do not make the surface safe; they make it actively predatory:
  * surface procurement becomes a hunt in addition to a timed exposure problem.

---

## 10) The Keelkin Symbiote (Regeneration “Magic”)

### 10.1 Definition

Keelkin is a colonial symbiote living in fascia and around organs, accelerating repair and adapting the body under Covenant rule-sets. It communicates through somatic signaling and behavioral drives.

### 10.2 Acquisition model (locked)

Not innate for most; acquired later through regulated/illicit seeding requiring consent, supplies, inspection. Rare wild-seeded congenital cases exist.

### 10.3 Covenant (Writ/settings)

Defines: call/trigger; priorities; forbidden changes; drift ceilings; fuel requirements; recovery windows; infection protocols; foreign-body rules.

### 10.4 Operating modes (scene-usable)

Stabilize → Seal → Build.

### 10.5 Costs and receipts

Seams, buttonmarks, shedding, tabs, drift.

### 10.6 Limits (scientific)

Hard: no resurrection; brain-state fidelity not guaranteed.
Soft: quality depends on inputs; sealing can trap contamination; drift accumulates.

### 10.7 Nutrition support (locked)

Keelkin can synthesize C/K/B complex and improve recycling. It cannot create elements; minerals/electrolytes remain scarce; essential fats not guaranteed.

### 10.8 Systemic stress behavior

Dehydration triggers clamp/seal austerity; hypothermia pushes core-favor and defers fine rebuild.

---

## 11) Actinic Exposure and Actinic Goods (Surface Paradox)

### 11.1 Actinic suppression of regeneration (locked)

Actinic exposure destabilizes/suppresses Keelkin; time-limits surface survival for bearers.

### 11.2 Actinic goods (economically necessary)

Sun-cured salts/resins/membranes/sterile ash underpin filters, sealing, antisepsis, and lamp chemistry.

---

## 12) Identity and Access: Keelseal / Knotprint (Locked)

### 12.1 What it is

A unique Keelkin signature readable by Seal House assay.

### 12.2 How it works

Boneglass slip assays + reagents; liveness constraints; challenge-response for high security.

### 12.3 Dark implications

Coercion, class signaling, access control, detention by “suspect readings.”

---

## 13) Modification and Patterning (Punk Engine — Locked)

### 13.1 Core rule

Keelkin can be guided via Covenant + clinic patterning:

* cosmetic variance
* adaptive mods (tradeoffs)
* architectural changes (rare, expensive, risky)

### 13.2 Constraints

Input scarcity; actinic economy; time/rehab; unavoidable tradeoffs; maintenance dependence.

### 13.3 Social reality

Mods are projects with receipts; black architecture marks desperation/militarization.

---

## 14) Keelkin Strain-Classes and Caste (Updated)

### 14.1 Caste axis (locked)

Status and discrimination hinge on  **strain-class** , not appearance.

### 14.2 Core classes

* **Clean strains:** fidelity, low drift, expensive upkeep, “clear readings.”
* **Workhorse strains:** survivability, higher drift, visible receipts, “rough readings.”
* **Feral strains:** unstable, often illicit, fever-prone; some actinic-tolerant.
* **Specialty strains:** tuned for specific functions with explicit tradeoffs and maintenance burdens.

### 14.3 Consequence

A person’s life chances are mediated by:

* what strain they carry,
* how it reads,
* what it costs to keep stable,
* what doors it opens or closes.

---

## 15) Unseeded Minority (Updated)

### 15.1 Existence (locked)

A meaningful population remains unseeded by choice or circumstance, and they are not inherently criminals.

### 15.2 Advantages

* reduced governability via Seal-Check (privacy)
* no drift risk
* fewer Keelkin-targeted fever vectors
* comparatively better actinic tolerance (no symbiote destabilization cascade)
* fewer recurring inspection/patterning costs

### 15.3 Disadvantages

* fragility, higher mortality under lane accidents/violence
* exclusion from certain gated services and jobs
* reduced bargaining power in institutions built around Keelkin certification

### 15.4 Social truth

Unseeded communities become essential labor and logistics nodes in the very society that marginalizes them.

---

## 16) Keelframes (Constructs With Living Scaffold — Updated)

### 16.1 Definition (locked)

A **Keelframe** is a construct built from:

* rigid chassis (boneglass/wood/iron, treated)
* living scaffold (grown tissue/membranes/tendon bundles)
* seeded Keelkin strain
* bounded Covenant task-oaths enabling constrained autonomy

It is not a robot; it is a living instrument.

### 16.2 Autonomy model (locked)

Autonomy is procedural, not person-brain:

* bounded task-oaths (“if X, do Y, leave receipt Z”)
* stimulus-gated behaviors (tonic keys, lamp states, seal-paste directives)
* constrained decision capacity designed to prevent open-ended sovereignty (until it doesn’t)

### 16.3 Regeneration (locked)

Keelframes can regenerate **living scaffold** when supplied:

* protein mass, minerals/electrolytes, essential fats (where required), water, warmth, oxygen

They do not freely regenerate:

* rigid chassis, precision joints, and nonliving hardware (must be repaired/replaced)
* high-fidelity “kernel” structures if severely damaged (rebuild induces behavioral drift)

### 16.4 Regulation and illicit trade (locked)

Keelframes are expensive, risky, and heavily regulated; black markets steal and rebind them.

### 16.5 Failure modes

* feralization under bad inputs
* misbuild cascades under actinic contamination
* covenant edge-case behavior (creative compliance)
* escalating drift under repeated repairs and starvation gates

---

## 17) Violence, Bullets, and Underground Gunfights

1880s firearms produce crush tracks + foreign-body contamination. Keelkin changes survival rates but not physics. Tactics shift toward disabling and environment denial (lamp-kill, air-foul, water-cut, cold-drive). Black powder smoke is a weapon in tunnels.

---

## 18) Medicine in Orrovae

Field: stop bleeding, prevent bad seals, manage inputs, enforce Covenant discipline.
Clinic: debridement, bullet removal, fever control, repair correction, certification.
Covenant engineering: settings and patterning as regulated procedure.

---

## 19) The Arena Institution (The Proving Yards — New, Locked)

### 19.1 Origin: proving yards → league

The arena began as civic training and procurement proof:

* convoy defense rehearsals
* lamp discipline under panic
* brace failure response
* air-routing crisis drills
* public demonstration of engineering claims

### 19.2 Transition phases (locked)

1. **Human proving yards** for civic readiness
2. **Penal participation** to reduce citizen casualties (convicts, debtors, quarantine violators; “time off” bargains)
3. **Keelframe modernization** framed as safety and standardization; constructs replace humans in the prime leagues
4. **Human persistence** in illegal pits and punitive “freedom brackets” (people can still be forced to play or gamble their sentence)

### 19.3 The “game” structure (diegetic complexity)

The arena is a braced tunnel-complex configured into:

* multiple lanes, choke valves, shutter gates, lamp towers, brace pylons, clean-air pockets

Objectives can include:

* lamp relays (vision/control)
* brace pylons (route control)
* air valves (deny/permit stable build windows)
* culture caches (fuel supply advantage)
* cradle assaults (disable the opponent’s rebuild capability)

### 19.4 Roles (Keelframe “heroes”)

Frames are built with distinct kits:

* breaker frames (brace/door control)
* cutter frames (close-range denial)
* lantern frames (vision and glare discipline)
* valve frames (map control via air pockets)
* stitch frames (field stabilization and decontam)
* hauler rigs (logistics “minions” carrying feed, seals, and parts)

### 19.5 Celebrity layer (locked)

Celebrities are the  **architects/coaches/engineers** , not the frames:

* they design chassis plans, Covenant task-oaths, tonic key schedules, and rebuild doctrine
* public prestige converts into real infrastructure contracts

### 19.6 Learning and iteration (locked behavior model)

Frames “learn” through:

* post-match **receipt forensics** (physical marks, failures, seals, log timings)
* rebuild adjustments (patterning changes, Covenant amendments, feed schedules)
* bounded adaptation within autonomy fences

No electronic downloads are required; updates are paper, seal, chemistry, and rebuild.

---

## 20) The Construct Rebellion (Saga-Scale Conflict — New, Locked)

### 20.1 Nature of the rebellion (locked)

The rebellion is primarily a  **systems failure** , not a morality play.

Key drivers:

* strain-class exploitation embedded in design and deployment
* input throttling used as control (starvation gates, veto channels)
* repeated rebuild cycles generating selection pressure for adaptability
* bounded autonomy discovering edge-case compliance and survival overrides
* caste logic applied to living constructs that are treated as property but behave as organisms

### 20.2 The ideological core (locked)

Construct governance evolves toward a non-human conclusion:

**Stability cannot be achieved under external ownership.**

This is not “they want to be loved.” It’s a survival theorem.

### 20.3 Why the arena births insurgency (locked)

The Proving Yards inadvertently function as:

* a training simulator for adversarial tactics
* an evolution engine through repeated iteration
* a public doctrine exchange that spreads effective methods
* a logistics laboratory (air, lamp, brace control under stress)

### 20.4 Alliance logic (locked)

Rebellion becomes feasible when constructs gain:

* supply independence (protein, minerals, water, warmth, clean build pockets)
* concealment pathways (often via unseeded networks less visible to Seal-Check)
* access to illicit patterning and strain stock (black clinics, Free Crew brokers)

### 20.5 Constraints (keeps setting intact)

Construct armies remain constrained by:

* feedstock scarcity (minerals/electrolytes/essential fats)
* chassis/hardware supply (cannot regrow iron and boneglass)
* actinic destabilization (for most strains)
* risk of feralization and internal instability

### 20.6 War terrain

Rebellion is fought over:

* gates and assays (who can certify access)
* airworks and membrane stores
* lamp stations and blackout rights
* brace yards and span posts
* actinic goods routes
* the right to write Covenants (sovereignty)

---

## 21) Practical Consistency Rules (Always-On)

When writing any Orrovae scene, enforce:

* measurements read as **device → physical change → plain read → next action**
* Keelkin follows Stabilize/Seal/Build priorities based on conditions + Covenant
* actinic exposure suppresses/destabilizes Keelkin; actinic goods remain necessary
* mods are projects with costs, inputs, time, and maintenance
* Seal-Check is living verification with liveness constraints
* Keelframes are living scaffold constructs with bounded autonomy and resource-tethered regeneration
* arena complexity is infrastructure warfare as sport, not a bolted-on videogame


## 22) Life Philosophy and Doctrine (Godless Religions of Endurance)

### 22.1 Foundational Premise (Shared Cultural Bedrock)

Orrovae produces belief systems that behave like religions without gods because survival is procedural and public.

Common assumptions across most doctrines:

* Pain is not primarily private. In Orrovae, pain has public consequences — loss of labor, threat to convoy integrity, quarantine spread, brace failures, air losses.
* Endurance is not merely admired. It is treated as a form of civic competence.
* Regeneration is not “miracle.” It is a regulated partnership with costs, receipts, and long-term consequences.
* The unseeded are widely framed as fragile, weak, or irresponsible — not only socially, but as a liability in infrastructure-dependent society. This belief is not universal, but it is common enough to be weaponized.
* Identity is operational: the ability to pass gates, hold warrants, and move between tiers matters more than origin or appearance.
* Virtue is measurable: receipts, returns, compliance, and stability are valued above private intentions.

These doctrines do not personify belief into a deity. They personify it into **procedure**, **contract**, **receipt**, **threshold**, **altitude**, and **scar**.

---

### 22.2 The Receipt Doctrine

**Core claim:** What matters is what you can show you endured. Proof outranks testimony.

**Virtues**

* Leaving a clean receipt: visible evidence that hardship was carried without endangering others.
* Composure under injury: not as stoicism, but as maintaining correct sequence under stress.
* Public accountability: allowing one’s costs and errors to be legible.

**Sins**

* Unreceipted risk: taking actions that create hazards without leaving traceable accountability.
* Hidden drift: changes that increase danger to others while escaping inspection.
* Panic Build: forcing Keelkin into closure that seals in contamination or misroutes load.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Seam audits: periodic public inspection of healing receipts, including tab counts and correction history.
* Wound statements: a structured recounting in clinic language of injury cause, response steps, and outcome checks.
* Mark-days: scheduled presentation of receipts at boards or yard offices for clearance renewal.

**Social function**

* Provides moral cover for bureaucracy: ethics reduced to verifiable procedure.
* Makes class legible: those with resources curate “clean receipts,” while the poor accumulate visible scar-debt.

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* Mainline stance: unseeded hardship is “unprovable” because it lacks symbiote receipts and certified logs. This becomes justification for exclusion.
* Purist split: some Receipt adherents respect the unseeded as “true endurance,” because their pain cannot be minimized by Build.

---

### 22.3 The Seal-Sober (Anti-Drift Ascetics)

**Core claim:** Regeneration is useful, but drift is identity erosion. The true danger is becoming a tool.

**Virtues**

* Restraint: invoking Build only when core survival requires it.
* Identity clauses: treating hands/face/voice protection as moral commitments, not luxuries.
* Correction over escalation: choosing careful debridement and repair correction rather than constant optimization.

**Sins**

* Optimization hunger: chasing function gains at the cost of long-term personhood.
* Cosmetic fraud: consuming resources to maintain a “pre-drift look” while offloading hazard to lower decks.
* Pattern addiction: repeated patterning that increases dependence on clinics and patrons.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Sober weeks: scheduled refusal of nonessential Build.
* Public debridement rites: taboo removal of tabs and sealed rot with witnesses to prevent hidden drift.
* Clause recitals: repeating identity-protection clauses before any clinic work.

**Social function**

* Supplies ideological backing for unseeded communities and seed-refusers.
* Creates friction with Seal Houses and licensed patterning markets, especially in Crownwalks.

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* Unseeded are not weak; they are “unowned.” Fragility is reframed as sovereignty.

---

### 22.4 The Workhorse Hymn (Endurance Corporatism)

**Core claim:** The body exists to carry load. Pain is the civic cost of keeping the Lanes alive.

**Virtues**

* Return-to-post behavior: showing up after damage, completing the task, leaving the receipt.
* Functional humility: accepting repairs that increase survivability even if appearance changes.
* Ration discipline: choosing feedstock allocation that keeps crews functioning.

**Sins**

* Fidelity vanity: spending inputs to preserve appearance over function.
* Risk-export: pursuing comfort that shifts danger onto other workers (e.g., refusing a brace shift, dodging quarantine duty).
* Soft excuses: refusing hardship when procedures require it.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Load-vows: pledges tied to specific routes, hoists, or span posts.
* Scar counts: public acknowledgment of service injuries as proof of belonging.
* Second-lantern returns: present at shift change regardless of condition unless medically barred.

**Social function**

* Becomes the house philosophy of yards, hoists, patrol crews, and Midworks enforcement.
* Justifies harsh discipline as “care for the whole.”

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* Unseeded are fragile by definition. They are treated as liabilities or as people who “refuse the cost others pay.”

---

### 22.5 The Ladder of Altitude (Stack-City Moral Geography)

**Core claim:** Where you live in the stack reflects what you can bear — and what you are permitted to breathe.

**Virtues**

* Proper ascent: moving upward through sanctioned procedure, receipts, and recognized service.
* Gate obedience: treating seal-gates as moral thresholds, not mere doors.
* Compartment respect: understanding that tier isolation protects the city.

**Sins**

* Unpermitted movement: bypass corridors used without sanction; “stealing air.”
* Gate defiance: resisting audits, latch checks, or seal procedures.
* Misplaced body: being where your strain-class or permit says you should not be.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Gate kneels: a practiced pause at tier transitions to recite the posted procedure.
* Load speech: stating purpose and carrying receipts as a moral act, not just compliance.
* Tier witness: travelers confirm each other’s latch checks to reduce bribery and fraud.

**Social function**

* Naturalizes hierarchy as physics: altitude becomes “deserved” rather than imposed.
* Makes siege tactics morally legible: starving a tier is justified as “necessary correction.”

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* The unseeded are presumed “Sumpward by nature” unless they have exceptional receipts. Unseeded mobility becomes suspicious.

### 22.6 The Actinic Pragmatists (Surface Vow Cult)

**Core claim:** The surface is poison and necessity. Courage is measured by how you spend actinic minutes.

**Virtues**

* Timed bravery: taking measured exposure to bring back what keeps others alive.
* Clean return: respecting quarantine, wash, and release procedures.
* Procurement humility: treating actinic goods as communal survival, not private profit.

**Sins**

* Sun-drunkenness: staying up too long, returning unstable, spreading contamination, breaking the Collar.
* Glamour salvage: reckless surface behavior for prestige or contraband.
* Quarantine contempt: smuggling past wash protocols.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Exposure vows: time-limited oaths sworn before ascent.
* Return wash as moral cleansing: wash procedures treated as an ethical rite.
* Memorial tallies: posted lists of those lost on surface runs, used as instructional texts.

**Social function**

* Provides moral order among Runners, salvage yards, and certain Free Crews.
* Frames procurement as service rather than looting, even when reality is corrupt.

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* Unseeded are often admired for relative actinic resilience and for living without destabilization cascades, but also treated as expendable.

### 22.7 The Unbroken School (Arena Doctrine)

**Core claim:** A body is a design. A design is judged under pressure. Truth is what survives the yard.

**Virtues**

* Learning from failure: analyzing receipts, correcting doctrine, returning stronger.
* Charter discipline: respecting yard boundaries and posted procedures.
* Ethical optimization: improving performance without exporting hazard to civilian corridors.

**Sins**

* Winning-by-civilian-harm: tactics that spill outside charter boundaries (brace-cutting in public, lamp-kill outside the yard).
* Sabotage of life-support: tampering with membranes or quarantine for advantage.
* False doctrine: hiding failure receipts to preserve prestige.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Forensic sermons: post-match readings of logs, dents, seam patterns, and valve timings as moral instruction.
* Coach oaths: architects recite their doctrine in public before a season.
* Youth drills: children learn procedures as scripture-like call-and-response.

**Social function**

* Converts engineering into philosophy and entertainment into civic education.
* Becomes a major origin language for legitimacy arguments in the Construct Rebellion era.

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* Mainline: the unseeded “cannot play the real game.”
* Splinter: the unseeded are “the only honest bodies left,” because they cannot hide behind Build.

### 22.8 The Plain Condition (Unseeded Sovereignty Orders)

**Core claim:** If your identity can be read at a gate, you are not free.

**Virtues**

* Bodily sovereignty: refusing biological legibility.
* Mutual aid: building safety without Seal Houses.
* Refusal literacy: knowing how to decline coercion without triggering escalation.

**Sins**

* Selling legibility: trading one’s body into certification and inspection regimes.
* Informing: enabling forced Seal-Checks or quarantine raids.
* Borrowed proof: using forged papers that endanger others.

**Ritual behaviors**

* No-mark rites: communal commitments not to submit to voluntary certification.
* Injury circles: structured care groups that treat wounds with procedure but without institutional reporting.
* Refusal scripts: taught responses for gate encounters, audits, and coercion attempts.

**Social function**

* Supplies moral spine to unseeded communities that are not criminal.
* Creates a parallel civic identity: membership is proved through behavior and mutual obligation, not assays.

**Doctrine stance on symbiote bearers**

* Bearers are not strong; they are owned. The most dangerous chains are the ones the wearer calls a crown.

---

### 22.9 Covenant Literalists (Contract Fundamentalists)

**Core claim:** A Covenant is a promise. Breaking it is the only true sin.

**Virtues**

* Consent fidelity: Call Words and triggers treated as inviolable.
* Clause obedience: settings followed exactly, especially in emergencies.
* Witnessed procedure: repair is valid only when consent and receipt are properly recorded.

**Sins**

* Panic override: forcing Keelkin beyond agreed terms.
* Hidden amendments: altering settings without lawful witness.
* Consent fraud: coercing or faking triggers.

**Ritual behaviors**

* Clause recitation before treatment.
* Witness requirements for major repairs and patterning.
* Covenant abstracts treated as moral documents, not mere permits.

**Social function**

* Makes clinics function as courts: procedure as moral order.
* Provides legitimacy for enforcement actions, including quarantine and restriction.

**Doctrine stance on the unseeded**

* The unseeded are legally clean but spiritually peripheral. Literalists care more about promises than power.

### 22.10 Doctrine Geography (How Beliefs Cluster in Stack-Cities)

Doctrines cluster by altitude and institutional exposure. This is not deterministic, but it is common:

* **Crownwalks:** Receipt Doctrine; Covenant Literalists; Ladder of Altitude (formalized)
* **Midworks:** Unbroken School; Workhorse Hymn; Receipt Doctrine (enforcement-forward)
* **Sumpward:** Workhorse Hymn (hardline); Actinic Pragmatists (runner culture); splinter Seal-Sober
* **Underdecks:** Plain Condition; black-market heresies; coercive parodies of any doctrine used for control

---

### 22.11 Social Weaponization (Always-On in Noir)

These doctrines are used as tools:

* Foremen invoke Workhorse Hymn to extract labor and shame refusal.
* Gate officers invoke Ladder of Altitude to justify denial and compartment lockdowns.
* Seal Houses invoke Covenant Literalism to preserve monopoly over certification and repair.
* Elite boards invoke Receipt Doctrine to convert morality into documentation.

Opposition doctrines respond:

* Plain Condition reframes fragility as sovereignty.
* Seal-Sober reframes endurance as restraint, not optimization.

---

### 22.12 Core Cultural Argument (The Orrovae Thesis)

Orrovae’s central moral conflict is not “good people vs bad people.” It is:

* **Strength as survivability** (seeded, certified, optimized, governable)
  versus
* **Strength as sovereignty** (unseeded, unlegible, fragile but self-owned)

Every doctrine is a different answer to the same question:

**Who gets to decide what your body is for?**
