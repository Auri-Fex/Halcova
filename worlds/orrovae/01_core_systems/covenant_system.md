# COVENANT SYSTEM

## Overview

The Covenant (also called Writ, Bond, or Pact depending on cultural tradition) is a negotiated agreement between host and Säidesolu that governs regeneration behavior. It functions as medical directive, legal contract, and partnership charter simultaneously. This document provides complete details on Covenant structure, drafting, enforcement, and manipulation.

---

## CORE CONCEPT

### What a Covenant Is

**NOT**:
- A spell or magical formula
- A religious oath (though some treat it that way)
- A simple medical form
- Optional

**IS**:
- A practical set of instructions and boundaries
- A legally recognized contract
- A communication tool between host and Säidesolu
- Essential for partnership stability
- Continuously active (governs every regeneration event)

### Why Covenants Exist

**The Problem**: 
- Säidesolu has its own intelligence and goals
- Without guidance, Säidesolu optimizes for survival (its priorities, not host's)
- This leads to unwanted drift, forbidden changes, Hollowing

**The Solution**:
- Explicit agreement on boundaries and priorities
- Host maintains agency over own body
- Keelkin knows what's permitted
- Reduces conflict and drift
- Legal protection for both parties

### Legal Status

**Legally Required**:
- All seeded persons in most jurisdictions
- Unseeded exempt (no Keelkin = no Covenant needed)
- Failure to have Covenant = legal vulnerability

**Enforcement**:
- Seal-Check includes Covenant verification
- Gates may demand Covenant display
- Employers require Covenant documentation
- Medical treatment contingent on Covenant compliance

**Exceptions**:
- Wild-seeded infants (Covenant drafted by parents/guardians)
- Emergency seeding (temporary Covenant, formalized later)
- Black market seeding (no Covenant = illegal status)

---

## COVENANT STRUCTURE

### The Eight Core Components

Every valid Covenant must specify these elements:

---

#### 1. CONSENT TRIGGER (The "Go" Signal)

**Purpose**: How host signals "Yes, heal this now"

**Types**:

**A) Verbal Trigger**
- Specific phrase spoken aloud
- Examples: "Mend," "Eisenherz, attend," "I consent to repair"
- Advantages: Clear, unambiguous
- Disadvantages: Can't speak if unconscious/throat injured

**B) Somatic Trigger**
- Physical gesture or action
- Examples: Press knot-organ, specific hand sign, tap pattern
- Advantages: Works when can't speak
- Disadvantages: May be hard if hands injured

**C) Conditional Trigger**
- Automatic under specified circumstances
- Examples: "Any life-threatening injury," "When blood loss exceeds X," "If unconscious"
- Advantages: Emergency protection
- Disadvantages: Less control, potential unwanted healing

**D) Combined Trigger**
- Multiple methods for redundancy
- Example: "Verbal OR somatic OR life-threat"
- Advantages: Maximum reliability
- Disadvantages: More complex, potential conflicts

**E) Continuous Consent**
- "Always heal everything immediately"
- Advantages: Maximum protection, no delays
- Disadvantages: No control, rapid drift, Hollowing risk
- **Legal Status**: Illegal in many jurisdictions (considered coercive/incompetent)

**Cultural Practices**:
- **Germanic**: Favor verbal triggers (documentation culture)
- **Anglo-Saxon**: Favor combined triggers (conservative redundancy)
- **Finno-Ugric**: Favor somatic triggers (minimalist, practical)

**Security Concern**:
- Triggers can be learned and exploited
- Coerced healing (forced trigger use)
- Sabotage (trigger manipulation)
- Private triggers vs. public knowledge

---

#### 2. PRIORITY HIERARCHY (What Matters Most)

**Purpose**: When choices conflict, what wins?

**Standard Priority Frameworks**:

**A) Survival-First** (Most Common)
- Life > Function > Appearance > Comfort
- Example: "Keep me alive, then worry about how I look"
- Users: Most working people, practical mindset

**B) Function-First**
- Function > Life > Appearance > Comfort
- Example: "I'd rather die than lose my hands/sight/ability to work"
- Users: Artisans, specialists, those dependent on specific abilities

**C) Appearance-First** (Rare, Upper Tier)
- Appearance > Function > Life > Comfort
- Example: "Don't change how I look, even if it costs function"
- Users: Upper tier, those with status/appearance-dependent roles
- **Social Stigma**: Viewed as vain/weak by lower tiers

**D) Pain-Control-First**
- Comfort > Function > Appearance > Life
- Example: "Minimize suffering above all"
- Users: Chronic pain sufferers, elderly, those with pain-trauma
- **Medical Concern**: Can lead to dangerous pain-suppression

**E) Identity-Preservation**
- Identity > Life > Function > Appearance
- Example: "Preserve my mind/memory/self even if body fails"
- Users: Scholars, those who fear Hollowing
- **Challenge**: Hard to enforce (brain damage erases enforcement)

**Custom Priorities**:
- Can specify unique hierarchies
- Example: "Hands > Eyes > Legs > Everything Else"
- Requires skilled Writ-Doctor to draft clearly

---

#### 3. FORBIDDEN ZONES (Absolute Boundaries)

**Purpose**: Parts of body Keelkin must not alter beyond minimal repair

**Common Forbidden Zones**:

**Face**
- Reason: Identity, recognition, social interaction
- Specification: "No changes to facial structure, features, or expression"
- Exception Clause: "Except to prevent death"
- Reality: Scars still happen, but architecture preserved

**Hands**
- Reason: Skill, identity, tools
- Specification: "Maintain hand structure, finger length, grip pattern"
- Exception: "May reinforce but not reshape"
- Reality: Fingerprints still change, strength may increase

**Voice**
- Reason: Identity, communication
- Specification: "Preserve vocal cord structure and larynx architecture"
- Exception: "Repair only, no optimization"
- Reality: Voice may deepen slightly, timbre shift

**Genitals**
- Reason: Identity, function, intimacy
- Specification: "No structural changes, preserve function and sensation"
- Exception: "Repair damage but maintain form"
- Reality: Function often preserved, sensation may alter

**Height**
- Reason: Identity, social recognition
- Specification: "No bone lengthening or compression beyond natural variation"
- Exception: "Healing fractures at natural length"
- Reality: Hard to enforce perfectly, slight changes accumulate

**Brain/Personality**
- Reason: Self-preservation
- Specification: "Minimum intervention, preserve consciousness and memory"
- Reality: Impossible to fully enforce (Keelkin can't rebuild memory)
- Effect: Psychological comfort more than practical protection

**Custom Forbidden Zones**:
- Any body part can be specified
- Example: "No changes to tattoos/scars/birthmarks" (identity markers)
- Example: "Preserve left hand exactly" (musician, artist)

---

#### 4. OPTIMIZATION CEILING (How Much Change Allowed)

**Purpose**: Define acceptable drift limits

**The Spectrum**:

**None / Zero Drift**
- "Restore to original form only, no optimization"
- Reality: Impossible to achieve perfectly
- Effect: Minimizes drift, sacrifices survival advantage
- Users: Upper tier, appearance-focused

**Minimal / Cosmetic Acceptable**
- "Small functional improvements okay, no visible changes"
- Reality: Seamwork still visible, optimization hidden
- Effect: Slight drift, good function
- Users: Midworks professionals

**Moderate / Functional Focus**
- "Functional improvements prioritized, appearance secondary"
- Reality: Visible drift accumulates, better performance
- Effect: Clear optimization, strong function
- Users: Labor, dangerous professions

**Aggressive / Survival Maximum**
- "Optimize as needed to keep me alive and working"
- Reality: Rapid drift, body changes significantly
- Effect: Powerful but transformed
- Users: Extreme professions, desperate situations

**Unlimited / No Ceiling** 
- "Do whatever keeps me alive, no restrictions"
- Reality: Keelkin given free reign
- Effect: Rapid Hollowing risk
- **Legal Status**: Banned in many places (considered negligent/suicidal)

**Specific Optimization Limits**:
- "May reinforce bones up to 20% density increase, no more"
- "Muscle enhancement acceptable to 150% baseline strength maximum"
- "Vision correction permitted, but preserve eye color and shape"

---

#### 5. FUEL REQUIREMENTS (Resource Schedule)

**Purpose**: Define what inputs host commits to providing

**Basic Fuel Covenant**:
- "Standard diet + mineral supplements as available"
- "Prioritize iron and protein when healing active"
- "Notify me when deficient" (via somatic signals)

**Enhanced Fuel Covenant**:
- "Premium nutrition maintained at all times"
- "Immediate supplementation when signaled"
- "Regular Writ-Doctor monitoring of levels"
- Cost: High (upper tier only)

**Austerity Fuel Covenant**:
- "Work with whatever available"
- "Austerity mode acceptable during scarcity"
- "Survival priority over quality"
- Reality: Poor healing quality, heavy drift

**Fuel Debt Clause**:
- "If fuel insufficient, may borrow from body reserves temporarily"
- "Debt must be repaid within [timeframe]"
- "If debt unpaid, enter austerity mode"

**Keelkin Harvest Clause** (Controversial):
- "Permit limited harvesting for Keel-Current generation"
- "Maximum [frequency] with [recovery time]"
- "Veto right if health compromised"
- Users: Poor who sell Keel-Current, Hollowed used as batteries

---

#### 6. RECOVERY WINDOWS (Rest Requirements)

**Purpose**: Define when and how long rest is needed

**Strict Recovery Covenant**:
- "Complete rest required during all Build phases"
- "No physical activity until healing complete"
- "Sleep 10-12 hours during major repairs"
- Users: Those who can afford downtime

**Moderate Recovery Covenant**:
- "Rest required for major repairs only"
- "Light activity permitted during minor repairs"
- "Sleep 8-10 hours when actively healing"
- Users: Most working people

**Minimal Recovery Covenant**:
- "Rest only if life-threatened"
- "Work through repairs when possible"
- "Sleep when convenient, not when healing"
- Reality: Poor healing quality, chronic fatigue
- Users: Those who can't afford rest (poor, enslaved)

**Recovery Override Clause**:
- "May refuse healing if rest impossible"
- "Defer non-critical repairs until conditions improve"
- "Signal when recovery window needed"

---

#### 7. INFECTION PROTOCOL (Clean vs. Seal Decision)

**Purpose**: What to do when tissue is contaminated

**Strict Clean Protocol**:
- "Never seal over contamination"
- "Always signal infection presence"
- "Wait for debridement before closure"
- "Pain acceptable if prevents rot-seal"
- Users: Those with access to medical care

**Balanced Protocol**:
- "Clean minor contamination, seal clean wounds"
- "Signal major contamination for decision"
- "Surface runs: seal after bleach bath only"
- "If life-threatened: seal anyway, deal with infection later"
- Users: Most people (practical compromise)

**Survival Protocol**:
- "Seal to prevent immediate death"
- "We'll deal with infection if we survive"
- "Speed over cleanliness in field conditions"
- Reality: High rot-seal risk
- Users: Combat, surface runs, emergencies

**Actinic Exposure Protocol** (Surface-Specific):
- "Seal minimally on surface, full clean underground"
- "Assume all surface wounds contaminated"
- "Mandatory bleach bath before deep repair"
- "Quarantine Collar overrides all other protocols"

---

#### 8. FOREIGN BODY RULES (What to Do With Embedded Objects)

**Purpose**: Handling bullets, shrapnel, splinters, etc.

**Expulsion Protocol**:
- "Push out all foreign bodies before sealing"
- "Signal presence of embedded objects"
- "Wait for surgical removal if cannot expel"
- Users: Those with medical access

**Encapsulation Protocol**:
- "If can't expel, wall it off"
- "Seal around foreign body, contain it"
- "Signal for eventual removal when safe"
- Reality: Tabs form, objects become "part of" body
- Users: Field conditions, practical approach

**Tolerance Protocol**:
- "Leave small foreign bodies if not threatening"
- "Splinters, grit, small shrapnel: encapsulate and ignore"
- "Only expel life-threatening objects"
- Reality: Accumulated foreign material over time
- Users: Those who can't afford repeated surgeries

**Bullet-Specific Clause** (Common):
- "Attempt expulsion, encapsulate if impossible"
- "Lead poisoning risk acknowledged"
- "Removal surgery when resources available"

---

## COVENANT DRAFTING PROCESS

### Timeline

**Initial Covenant** (Post-Seeding):
- Timing: 6-12 months after seeding successful
- Duration: 2-6 Writ-Doctor sessions
- Cost: Moderate to high (subsidized for poor in some places)

**Amendment** (As Needed):
- Timing: After major life changes, injuries, or drift concerns
- Duration: 1-3 sessions
- Cost: Lower than initial drafting

**Emergency Covenant** (Crisis Seeding):
- Timing: Immediate
- Duration: Single session, temporary
- Cost: Variable
- Follow-up: Proper Covenant drafted within months

---

### The Drafting Session

**Step 1: Assessment** (30-60 minutes)
- Writ-Doctor examines partnership
- Tests communication (somatic signals, dream-bleed if present)
- Assesses Keelkin personality and tendencies
- Reviews host health, profession, risks
- Discusses host values and priorities

**Step 2: Education** (30-90 minutes)
- Explain Covenant components
- Discuss consequences of choices
- Review similar Covenants (examples)
- Address misconceptions
- Legal requirements explained

**Step 3: Negotiation** (1-3 hours)
- Host states preferences
- Writ-Doctor translates to Covenant language
- Keelkin response assessed (via signals)
- Conflicts identified and resolved
- Compromises reached

**Step 4: Drafting** (30-60 minutes)
- Writ-Doctor writes formal Covenant text
- Legal language + technical specifications
- Clarity and enforceability prioritized
- Host reviews and approves

**Step 5: Binding** (15-30 minutes)
- Covenant read aloud to host and Keelkin
- Host signs/marks document
- Writ-Doctor witnesses and seals
- Keelkin "acknowledgment" verified (somatic response)
- Copies made (host, Writ-Doctor, legal registry)

**Step 6: Testing** (30-60 minutes)
- Controlled injury (supervised)
- Observe Keelkin response
- Verify Covenant followed
- Adjust if needed
- Document results

---

### Cultural Variations in Drafting

**Germanic Tradition**:
- Formal, documented process
- Emphasis on legal precision
- Guild representative present
- Covenant becomes official record
- Amendments rare (considered binding)

**Anglo-Saxon Tradition**:
- Private, family ceremony
- Emphasis on honor and tradition
- Clan elders witness
- Covenant kept within family
- Oral transmission acceptable (written backup)

**Finno-Ugric Tradition**:
- Minimal formality
- Emphasis on personal connection
- Often no Writ-Doctor (self-drafted)
- Spoken covenant, rarely written
- Amendments fluid (relationship evolves)

REGISTERED: Ruinmouth Emergency Covenant Log, #2847
DATE: [Orrovae calendar equivalent]
```

**Notes**: High-risk Covenant, aggressive drift expected. Blutrufer very active, strong personality, partnership intense. Vask showing significant optimization after 2 years (thick skin, reinforced ribs, altered hands). Approaching Threshold concern per last Writ-Doctor eval.

---

### Covenant 4: Unseeded Proxy (Guardian Covenant for Wild-Seeded Infant)

**Host**: Kaisa (wild-seeded infant, 6 months old)
**Keelkin**: Kivi (Stone)
**Drafted**: By parents Taavi and Sini

```
GUARDIAN COVENANT FOR KAISA AND KIVI

Drafted by parents Taavi Sovereign and Sini Hollow on behalf of minor child Kaisa, wild-seeded at birth, until age of majority.

1. CONSENT TRIGGER
   Automatic for all injuries (child cannot consent).
   Parental override: Taavi or Sini may command "Hold" (defer non-critical healing).

2. PRIORITY HIERARCHY
   Life > Development > Function > Comfort > Appearance
   Preserve normal childhood development above all.

3. FORBIDDEN ZONES
   - Brain (minimum intervention)
   - Face (preserve natural development)
   - Genitals (preserve natural development)
   - Overall growth pattern (do not accelerate or delay)

4. OPTIMIZATION CEILING
   NONE until age 16.

   Expel immediately.
   No encapsulation (child cannot consent to surgery later).

SIGNED: Taavi Sovereign (father)
SIGNED: Sini Hollow (mother)
WITNESSED: Iker, Unseeded Community Elder
REGISTERED: Hollow District Autonomous Registry, #47
DATE: [Orrovae calendar equivalent]

ADDENDUM: Kivi acknowledged via unusual infant response pattern (verified by community Writ-Doctor as genuine acknowledgment despite age). Partnership appears stable. Monitor for fever and developmental milestones.
```

**Notes**: Wild-seeding is controversial. This Covenant emphasizes parental control and child protection. Kivi appears unusually gentle for wild-seeded Keelkin. Community watching closely.

---

### Covenant 5: Hollowing Prevention (Strict Boundaries)

**Host**: Miren Lightkeeper, Age 45, Steadfast strain (20 years partnered)
**Keelkin**: Tiefschatten (Deep-shadow)
**Drafted**: Amendment #3 (drift concerns rising)

```

COUNTER-SIGNED: Kelna Writ-Doctor (independent evaluator)
REGISTERED: Korrgate Hollow-Prevention Registry, Case #892
DATE: [Orrovae calendar equivalent]
```

**Notes**: Miren showing early Threshold signs (Blurring stage). Tiefschatten resistance noted during binding (somatic signals weak, required repeated reading). Partnership strain evident. Prognosis uncertain. Recommend intensive monitoring.

---

### Covenant 6: Military/Arena Combat (Framelike Optimization)

**Host**: Brok Ironside, Age 24, Strongarm strain (specialty)
**Keelkin**: Knochenbinder (Bone-binder)
**Drafted**: Arena employment contract Covenant

(Arena Proving Yards Employment Conditional)

1. CONSENT TRIGGER
   Automatic during sanctioned matches.
   Verbal command outside arena: "Bind"
   Emergency: Any life threat

2. PRIORITY HIERARCHY
   Combat Effectiveness > Life > Function > Comfort > Appearance
   Maximize performance in Proving Yard conditions.

3. FORBIDDEN ZONES
   Brain (preserve cognition and decision-making)
   Eyes (preserve sight)
   Genitals (employer insurance requirement)
   
4. OPTIMIZATION CEILING
   AGGRESSIVE.
   Maximize strength, endurance, pain tolerance.
   Visible drift acceptable and expected.
   Employer bonuses tied to optimization metrics.

5. FUEL REQUIREMENTS
   Premium nutrition provided by employer.
   Supplements included in contract.
   Immediate replenishment after matches.

6. RECOVERY WINDOWS
   48 hours post-match (contractual).
   Employer-supervised rest facility.
   Return to training only with clearance.

7. INFECTION PROTOCOL
   Arena medical team oversight.

ADDITIONAL CLAUSES:

9. EMPLOYER RIGHTS
   Employer may mandate specific optimizations.
   Brok retains veto on brain/consciousness modifications.
   Drift monitoring documented for sponsorship purposes.

10. TERMINATION CONDITIONS
    If Hollowing signs appear, contract voids.
    Brok released from optimization requirements.
    Employer provides Hollowing-prevention care (1 year).

11. POST-CAREER SUPPORT
    Upon retirement, employer funds drift-reduction therapy.
    Covenant may be amended to reverse optimizations.
    Lifetime medical coverage for combat-related conditions.

SIGNED: Brok Ironside
EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVE: Arena Commission, Proving Yards Division
WITNESSED: Arena Medical Director
REGISTERED: Arena Employment Covenant Archive, Contract #PY-4782
DATE: [Orrovae calendar equivalent]
```

**Notes**: Legal but ethically controversial. Brok's drift extremely rapid (2 years = 40+ Drift accumulation). Employer incentivizes dangerous optimization. Hollowing risk very high but contractually mitigated. Unseeded activists cite this as exploitation. Arena Commission defends as voluntary and compensated.

---

### Covenant 7: Forced Labor / Prison (Coercive)

**Host**: Iker (prisoner #4782, no surname given)
**Keelkin**: [Name withheld per prisoner refusal to cooperate]
**Drafted**: State-mandated Covenant (prisoner did not consent)

```
STATE-MANDATED COVENANT 
Prisoner #4782 and Unnamed Keelkin

By authority of [Jurisdiction] Corrections Bureau, the following Covenant is imposed for duration of sentence (15 years labor).

1. CONSENT TRIGGER
   Automatic for all injuries.
   Prisoner consent not required.
   
2. PRIORITY HIERARCHY
   Labor Capacity > Life > Function
   Appearance irrelevant.
   Comfort irrelevant.

3. FORBIDDEN ZONES
   None.
   State reserves right to all modifications necessary for labor compliance.

4. OPTIMIZATION CEILING
   Maximum.
   Optimize for labor output.
   Drift unlimited.
   Hollowing acceptable if labor capacity maintained.

5. FUEL REQUIREMENTS
   Prison rations (minimal).
   Supplements only if labor output declines.

6. RECOVERY WINDOWS
   Rest only if labor capacity compromised.
   Work through pain unless physically impossible.

7. INFECTION PROTOCOL
   Seal immediately.
   Infection treatment only if labor capacity threatened.

8. FOREIGN BODY RULES
   Encapsulate.
   Removal only if work-preventing.

ADDITIONAL CLAUSES:

9. STATE RIGHTS
   State may harvest Keel-Current from prisoner.
   Prisoner may not refuse harvesting.
   Excessive harvesting resulting in death: acceptable loss.

10. FORCED MODIFICATIONS
     State may mandate optimizations for specific labor.
     Prisoner resistance: Punishable offense.
     Hollowing: Prisoner becomes state property (full Hollowing = no release).

11. NO AMENDMENT RIGHTS
     Prisoner may not amend this Covenant.
     Duration: Until sentence completion or death.

IMPOSED BY: [Jurisdiction] Corrections Writ-Doctor
WITNESSED: Prison Warden [Name]
REGISTERED: State Corrections Covenant Archive, #C-4782
DATE: [Orrovae calendar equivalent]

PRISONER STATEMENT: "I do not consent. This is slavery." —Iker
STATE RESPONSE: "Consent not required per Corrections Act Section 47, Subsection 12. Covenant legally binding."
```

**Notes**: This is the horror. Legal in some jurisdictions. Iker is unseeded activist convicted of "conspiracy to undermine Seal-Check authority" (political prisoner). Forced seeding as punishment. Keelkin refuses to give name to captors (first recorded instance of Keelkin political resistance?). Iker's body already showing optimization (6 months in). Expected survival: 3-7 years before Hollowing or death. Unseeded communities cite this as central argument against seeding.

## COVENANT AMENDMENT PROCESS

### When Amendment Needed

**Life Changes**:
- Career change (different risks)
- Pregnancy/childbirth
- Major injury/trauma
- Aging (different priorities)

**Partnership Changes**:
- Communication improvement (knot-voice emerges)
- Drift concerns (tighten restrictions)
- Trust deepens (loosen restrictions)
- Hollowing warning (emergency tightening)

**Legal Requirements**:
- Jurisdiction change (different laws)
- Employment mandate (job requires specific Covenant)
- Court order (punishment or protection)

### Amendment Steps

**1. Request** (Host or Writ-Doctor initiates)
**2. Consultation** (Review current Covenant, discuss changes)
**3. Negotiation** (Host + Keelkin + Writ-Doctor)
**4. Drafting** (New clauses written)
**5. Binding** (Read aloud, signed, sealed)
**6. Testing** (Verify compliance)
**7. Registration** (Official record updated)

**Cost**: 30-50% of initial Covenant drafting cost

### Amendment Limits

**Cannot Change**:
- Keelkin identity (you're partnered with who you're partnered with)
- Past injuries/drift (amendments forward-looking only)

**Hard to Change**:
- Forbidden zones (Keelkin may resist loosening)
- Optimization ceiling (once drift started, hard to reverse)

**Easy to Change**:
- Consent triggers (add redundancy)
- Recovery windows (adapt to circumstances)
- Fuel requirements (adjust to income)

## BLACK MARKET COVENANT MANIPULATION

### Illegal Practices

**1. Covenant Forgery**
- Fake Writ-Doctor seals
- Forged signatures
- False registry entries
- Purpose: Evade restrictions, hide criminal optimizations

**2. Forced Covenant Amendment**
- Coerced signing under threat
- Drugged/unconscious host
- Keelkin directly manipulated (experimental, rare)
- Purpose: Trafficking, slavery, exploitation

**3. Covenant Nullification**
- Deliberate destruction of legal copies
- Registry hacking/bribes
- Claim "lost Covenant" (then draft permissive replacement)
- Purpose: Enable drift, escape legal obligations

**4. Covenant Piracy** (Copying Others' Covenants)
- Steal well-drafted Covenants
- Apply to own partnership (often fails, Keelkin resists)
- Sell to others (black market service)
- Purpose: Avoid drafting costs

**5. Covenant Sabotage**
- Modify enemy's Covenant secretly
- Change priorities, triggers, forbidden zones
- Purpose: Cause harm (forced optimization, unwanted changes)

### Black Market Covenant Services

**Illegal Writ-Doctors**:
- Draft Covenants without licenses
- Specialize in combat/criminal optimizations
- Cheaper but dangerous (poor quality)
- Operating in Underdeck, Fringe settlements

**Covenant Ghostwriters**:
- Write Covenants designed to evade law
- Clever loopholes, hidden clauses
- Legal gray area (ghostwriting not always illegal, content often is)

**Covenant Breakers**:
- Specialists in nullifying Covenants
- Experimental techniques (drugs, manipulation, coercion)
- High risk of Keelkin death or Hollowing
- Extremely illegal, extremely expensive

## COVENANT FAILURE CASES

### Type 1: Keelkin Non-Compliance

**Cause**: Keelkin ignores Covenant, acts autonomously
**Signs**:
- Healing without consent trigger
- Violates forbidden zones
- Exceeds optimization ceiling
- Refuses to signal properly

**Response**:
- Immediate Writ-Doctor consultation
- Covenant reinforcement (re-reading, re-binding)
- Possible sedation/temporary suppression
- Emergency amendment if needed
- Last resort: Keelkin removal (often fatal)

**Legal Status**: Host not at fault (usually)

---

### Type 2: Host Non-Compliance

**Cause**: Host violates own Covenant
**Examples**:
- Refusing fuel requirements
- Not providing recovery windows
- Ignoring infection protocols
- Deliberate forbidden zone injuries

**Response**:
- Keelkin distress (signals, possible shutdown)
- Partnership deterioration
- Repair quality collapse
- Possible Keelkin death

**Legal Status**: Host liable for Keelkin abuse (in some jurisdictions)

---

### Type 3: Impossible Covenant

**Cause**: Covenant asks for impossible things
**Examples**:
- "No drift whatsoever" (impossible to achieve)
- "Heal perfectly with no inputs" (violates physics)
- "Never prioritize life" (Keelkin may refuse)

**Response**:
- Keelkin stress and confusion
- Unpredictable behavior
- Partnership failure
- Requires amendment to realistic terms

**Legal Status**: Writ-Doctor liable if drafted impossible Covenant

---

### Type 4: Covenant Conflict (Multi-Clause Contradiction)

**Cause**: Clauses contradict each other
**Example**: "Never change appearance" + "Optimize aggressively for survival"

**Response**:
- Keelkin makes judgment call (dangerous)
- Host upset by "wrong" choice
- Partnership strain
- Requires clarification amendment

**Legal Status**: Drafting error (Writ-Doctor liable)

---

### Type 5: Coerced Covenant

**Cause**: Host forced to accept Covenant against will
**Signs**:
- Duress noted in record (if honest)
- Host complaints post-binding
- Covenant obviously exploitative

**Response**:
- Legal challenge (if jurisdiction allows)
- Sanctuary with sympathetic Writ-Doctors
- Underground Covenant replacement
- Escape to different jurisdiction

**Legal Status**: Varies wildly by jurisdiction
- Some: Coercion voids Covenant
- Some: Covenant binding regardless of consent
- Some: Specific exceptions (prisoners, children, enslaved)

## CULTURAL ATTITUDES TOWARD COVENANTS

### Receipt Doctrine
- Covenant is proof of responsibility
- Well-drafted Covenant = ethical person
- Covenant violations recorded (public shame)

### Seal-Sober
- Covenant should prioritize restraint
- Tight restrictions = virtue
- Loose Covenant = moral weakness

### Workhorse Hymn
- Covenant should prioritize function
- Appearance/comfort restrictions = vanity
- Practical Covenant = honorable

### Ladder of Altitude
- Covenant quality signals class
- Upper tier: Detailed, restrictive, expensive
- Lower tier: Simple, permissive, cheap
- Covenant itself is status symbol

### Actinic Pragmatists
- Covenant must account for surface realities
- Survival protocols essential
- Idealistic restrictions get you killed

### Unbroken School
- Covenant is partnership charter
- Should evolve with learning
- Rigid Covenant prevents growth

### Plain Condition
- Covenant is proof of Keelkin ownership
- Unseeded freedom includes freedom from contracts
- Any Covenant is compromise of sovereignty

### Covenant Literalists
- Covenant is sacred contract
- Breaking it is ultimate sin
- Enforcement is moral duty

### Bracefaith
- Covenant should allow suffering (builds strength)
- Pain-minimization = weakness
- Covenant that permits hardship = virtue

---

## COVENANT ENFORCEMENT

### Who Enforces?

**Writ-Doctors**: Primary enforcers (medical authority)
**Seal Houses**: Verify Covenant compliance during Seal-Check
**Employers**: Require specific Covenant terms as job condition
**Legal System**: Prosecute Covenant violations in some jurisdictions
**Social Pressure**: Community enforcement (shame, ostracism)

### Enforcement Methods

**Medical Review**:
- Regular Writ-Doctor check-ins
- Drift monitoring
- Keelkin behavior assessment
- Compliance certification

**Seal-Check Integration**:
- Covenant verification at gates
- Automated compliance checking (some jurisdictions)
- Violations flagged for investigation

**Legal Penalties**:
- Fines for violations
- Mandatory amendment
- Forced Keelkin removal (extreme)
- Imprisonment (coerced Covenant cases)

**Social Consequences**:
- Reputation damage
- Employment loss
- Gate access restricted
- Community ostracism
