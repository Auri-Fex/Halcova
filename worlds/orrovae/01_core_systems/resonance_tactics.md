## OVERVIEW

Säide colonies synchronize when hosts are in proximity, creating emotional resonance between bearers. What evolved as a community bonding mechanism has been weaponized in the Maiming Wars. This document details tactical applications, countermeasures, and combat implications.

**Core Mechanic**: Multiple Säide colonies within range (~3-10 meters) begin to synchronize emotional states. The stronger the emotion, the faster and wider it spreads.

---

## BASELINE RESONANCE RULES

### Range Factors

| Factor | Effect on Range |
|--------|-----------------|
| Colony size | Larger colonies = longer range |
| Emotion intensity | Stronger emotions = longer range |
| Host density | More hosts nearby = amplification |
| Strain type | Workhorse strains resonate stronger |
| Physical barriers | Stone/metal reduce range slightly |
| Unseeded presence | No effect (they can't participate) |

**Standard Ranges**:
- Calm state: 3-4 meters
- Mild emotion: 5-6 meters
- Strong emotion: 7-10 meters
- Extreme emotion (terror, rage): 10-15 meters

### Synchronization Speed

| Emotion Type | Time to Full Sync | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Fear/Panic | 5-15 seconds | Fastest; survival priority |
| Rage/Aggression | 10-20 seconds | Fast; linked to threat response |
| Joy/Euphoria | 30-60 seconds | Moderate; positive emotions spread slower |
| Grief/Despair | 1-5 minutes | Slow but profound; hard to break |
| Calm/Contentment | 5-10 minutes | Slowest; requires sustained proximity |

### Intensity Scaling

When multiple bearers share the same emotion, intensity compounds:

| Bearer Count | Intensity Multiplier | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 2-3 | 1.2x | Noticeable enhancement |
| 4-10 | 1.5x | Strong emotional pressure |
| 11-25 | 2x | Overwhelming; hard to resist |
| 26-50 | 3x | Individual will erodes |
| 51-100 | 4x | Mob psychology inevitable |
| 100+ | 5x+ | Riot conditions |

## TACTICAL WEAPONIZATION

### Offensive Applications

#### 1. PANIC CASCADE

**Purpose**: Cause enemy formation to break
**Method**: Insert 3-5 operatives with artificially-induced terror into enemy ranks
**Execution**:
1. Operatives take fear-inducing compounds (chemical enhancement)
2. Move into close proximity with enemy soldiers
3. Their amplified terror spreads via resonance
4. Enemy soldiers feel terror not their own
5. Discipline breaks; rout follows

**Effectiveness**: 70-80% in crowded formations
**Countermeasure**: Spacing discipline (see below)
**Who Uses It**: The Unmaimed (to "reveal" weak Patterns in enemy ranks)

#### 2. RAGE AMPLIFICATION

**Purpose**: Turn neutral crowds violent
**Method**: Agitators amplify existing anger until mob forms
**Execution**:
1. Position 10-15 operatives in crowd
2. Begin chanting or shouting (surface trigger)
3. Operatives deliberately cultivate rage internally
4. Resonance spreads rage through crowd
5. Crowd reaches violence threshold
6. Operatives withdraw; mob continues on momentum

**Effectiveness**: 60-70% in already-tense situations
**Countermeasure**: Crowd dispersal, Unseeded peacekeepers
**Who Uses It**: All factions (protests, riots, political manipulation)

#### 3. DESPAIR INFECTION

**Purpose**: Break enemy morale without combat
**Method**: Sustained proximity during siege or standoff
**Execution**:
1. Position operatives at perimeter of enemy position
2. Operatives cultivate genuine despair (trained skill)
3. Over hours/days, despair leaks through resonance
4. Enemy forces experience hopelessness
5. Surrender or desertion follows

**Effectiveness**: 40-50% (requires time and discipline)
**Countermeasure**: Rotation, morale rituals
**Who Uses It**: The Ledgers (siege operations, document-based psychological warfare)

#### 4. BERSERK TRIGGER

**Purpose**: Turn friendly forces into shock troops
**Method**: Controlled rage amplification before assault
**Execution**:
1. Assault team gathers in tight formation
2. Commander begins war chant (cultural trigger)
3. Resonance amplifies aggression across unit
4. Pain tolerance increases, fear decreases
5. Unit commits to charge without hesitation

**Effectiveness**: 90% (but control is lost)
**Countermeasure**: None once committed; exhaustion after
**Who Uses It**: Mercenary companies, The Unmaimed "Tested" units

---

### Defensive Applications

#### 1. CALM SPHERE

**Purpose**: Create protected zone of emotional stability
**Method**: Trained Säide-Writs maintain artificial calm
**Execution**:
1. Position 4-6 highly-trained bearers at perimeter
2. Each maintains deep calm (meditation practice)
3. Their calm creates "bubble" of stability
4. Incoming emotional waves dampened
5. Defenders inside maintain rationality

**Effectiveness**: 50-60% against standard panic
**Limitation**: Breaks if any defender loses composure
**Who Uses It**: Säide-Writ medical teams, command centers

#### 2. RESONANCE JAMMING

**Purpose**: Break enemy coordination
**Method**: Introduce conflicting emotions to create interference
**Execution**:
1. Operatives each cultivate *different* strong emotions
2. One feels rage, one feels fear, one feels despair
3. Conflicting resonance creates "static"
4. Enemy can't achieve synchronization
5. Their coordinated assaults fail

**Effectiveness**: 60-70% in disrupting enemy resonance attacks
**Limitation**: Operatives experience emotional whiplash
**Who Uses It**: Counter-intelligence units, The Shapers (experimental)

#### 3. SPACING DISCIPLINE

**Purpose**: Prevent resonance effects entirely
**Method**: Maintain minimum distance between soldiers
**Execution**:
1. Train soldiers to maintain 4+ meter spacing
2. Formations designed with gaps
3. No clustering during rest
4. Messengers move between groups, never join them

**Effectiveness**: 90% (resonance can't reach across gaps)
**Limitation**: Reduces traditional formation advantages
**Who Uses It**: Professional military units, Free Crews

## CROWD DYNAMICS

### Why Crowds Are Dangerous

In dense crowds, resonance becomes nearly unstoppable:

**The Feedback Loop**:
1. One person feels fear
2. Resonance spreads fear to neighbors
3. Neighbors' fear amplifies original fear
4. Amplified fear spreads to more neighbors
5. Loop accelerates until entire crowd synchronized

**Critical Mass**: At approximately 50+ bearers in close proximity, any strong emotion will spread to the entire group within 60 seconds.

### Crowd Panic Mechanics

| Phase | Time | Description | Countermeasure Window |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| Trigger | 0-5s | Initial fear event | Immediate response possible |
| Local Spread | 5-20s | Nearby bearers affected | Isolation still possible |
| Cascade | 20-45s | Wave spreads outward | Dispersal required |
| Full Sync | 45-90s | Entire crowd synchronized | Too late; manage aftermath |
| Stampede | 90s+ | Physical panic behavior | Prevent trampling only |

### Crowd Violence Mechanics

| Phase | Time | Description | Intervention Point |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Agitation | 0-5m | Anger building, still controllable | Address grievance |
| Amplification | 5-15m | Resonance spreading rage | Remove agitators |
| Critical | 15-30m | Violence imminent | Disperse now |
| Eruption | 30m+ | Violence begins | Containment only |

## MILITARY IMPLICATIONS

### Unit Composition

**Problem**: Traditional tight formations become resonance hazards
**Solution**: New unit structures

**The Lattice Formation**:
- Soldiers maintain 4-meter spacing in grid
- Lose shield-wall advantages
- Gain resonance immunity
- Requires individual combat skill

**The Cell Structure**:
- Units of 3-4 soldiers (below cascade threshold)
- Cells separated by 10+ meters
- Cells coordinate via signals, not proximity
- Each cell can fight independently

**Mixed Units**:
- Include 1-2 Unseeded per squad
- Unseeded immune to resonance
- Act as "anchors" when others lose control
- Controversial (Seeded distrust Unseeded)

### Command Considerations

**The Command Bubble Problem**:
- Commanders need staff nearby
- Staff proximity creates resonance risk
- One panicking advisor = panicking command
- Solution: Unseeded advisors, or dispersed command

**Signal Systems**:
- Cannot rely on verbal commands in crowds
- Visual signals (flags, lights) essential
- Pre-arranged codes for common orders
- Drum patterns (traditional, resonance-free)

### Combat Scenarios

#### Defensive Battle

**Resonance Advantage**: Defenders can maintain calm; attackers must cross open ground (spacing) then compress to assault (vulnerable)

**Tactic**: Allow enemy to compress at gates/breaches, then induce panic in the choke point

#### Offensive Battle

**Resonance Disadvantage**: Assault requires compression; compressed troops vulnerable to defender-induced panic

**Tactic**: Use spacing discipline until final assault; accept some resonance-induced casualties; rotate units to prevent exhaustion

#### Urban Fighting

**Resonance Nightmare**: Tight spaces, civilian crowds, unpredictable contact

**Tactic**: Small cells, Unseeded scouts, avoid civilian concentrations, accept slower advance

## CONSTRUCT INTERACTIONS

### Säideframe Resonance

Constructs built with Säide components have their own resonance characteristics:

**Key Difference**: Construct Säide doesn't synchronize with human Säide the same way

| Interaction | Effect | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Human → Construct | Minimal | Constructs don't feel human emotions |
| Construct → Human | Unsettling | "Alien" emotional pressure |
| Construct → Construct | Unknown | May explain coordinated "malfunction" |

**Tactical Implication**: Constructs make excellent shock troops—they don't panic, don't rage, don't synchronize with human resonance waves.

**The Glitch**: In Books 2-3, constructs begin showing signs of synchronized behavior that shouldn't be possible. Are they developing their own resonance network?

## COUNTERMEASURES

### Individual Level

| Countermeasure | Effectiveness | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Meditation training | 30-40% | Helps resist, not prevent |
| Spacing awareness | 50-60% | Move away from crowds |
| Chemical dampeners | 70-80% | Side effects (dulled emotions) |
| Covenant adjustment | 60-70% | Reduces resonance sensitivity |
| Unseeded escort | 90% | They break the chain |

### Unit Level

| Countermeasure | Effectiveness | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Spacing discipline | 90% | But reduces formation power |
| Mixed Seeded/Unseeded | 80% | Social friction cost |
| Resonance jammers | 60-70% | Requires trained specialists |
| Pre-battle rituals | 40-50% | Establishes baseline calm |
| Rotation schedules | 50-60% | Prevents exhaustion-vulnerability |

### Societal Level

| Countermeasure | Implementation | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Crowd size limits | Legal caps on gathering size | Unpopular, hard to enforce |
| Resonance-free zones | Areas where spacing required | Used in markets, courts |
| Unseeded peacekeepers | Unseeded patrol dense areas | Politically sensitive |
| Emergency dispersal protocols | Practiced evacuation routes | Requires infrastructure |

## STORY APPLICATIONS

### Book 1: Introduction

**Chapter 3 (Torven)**: First combat scene shows resonance in action. His squad maintains spacing; enemy mercenaries cluster and panic when one is wounded.

**Chapter 7 (Helmar)**: Witnesses crowd panic in administrative district when bad news spreads. Sees how fast fear moves through a crowd.

**Chapter 12 (Kaisa)**: Runner crew uses calm sphere technique during surface run. One crew member breaks composure; fear cascades through the group.

### Book 2: Escalation

**Key Scene**: The Unmaimed deliberately induce crowd violence to discredit reform movement. Protagonists realize emotions are being weaponized.

**Torven's Death**: His final battle involves fighting through resonance-induced chaos. He maintains calm when others don't—which is why he's targeted.

### Books 3-4: War Conditions

Resonance warfare becomes standard. Both sides employ it. Unseeded become strategically valuable (as anchors). The horror of not trusting your own emotions.

### Book 5: Resolution

The surface creatures have their own resonance—and it's *compatible* with underground Säide. First contact involves overwhelming emotional communication. Not attack—communication.

## DIALOGUE SAMPLES

**Torven (briefing soldiers)**:
> "Four meters. I don't care if you think Karik is your best friend. Four meters minimum. The moment you cluster, you're one bad thought away from being a mob."

**Sigurd (explaining to patient)**:
> "Your Säide wants to connect. That's not weakness—it's what they evolved to do. The weakness is forgetting that connection can be used against you."

**Eneko (to Unseeded council)**:
> "They call us 'empty,' but watch what happens when their panic spreads and we stand calm. We are the stones in the stream. They need us more than they admit."

**The Unmaimed Arbiter**:
> "Let their fear reveal their Patterns. Those who fall to panic were always weak-threaded. We simply create the conditions for truth."

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Combat Resonance Rules

- **Safe distance**: 4+ meters prevents synchronization
- **Panic spreads**: Fear travels fastest (5-15 seconds to full sync)
- **Cascade threshold**: 50+ bearers = unstoppable wave
- **Unseeded**: Immune (break resonance chains)
- **Constructs**: Don't synchronize with humans (shock troop advantage)

### Red Flags (Resonance Attack Incoming)

1. Enemy operatives moving into your formation
2. Unusual emotional intensity from isolated individuals  
3. Crowds being deliberately compressed
4. Agitators cultivating anger rather than making arguments
5. Your own emotions feeling "not quite yours"
