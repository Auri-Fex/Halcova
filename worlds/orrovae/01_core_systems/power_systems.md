# POWER SYSTEMS

## Overview

Underground civilization requires vast amounts of energy for lighting, air circulation, water pumping, heating, manufacturing, and life support. Three primary power sources exist: Glowstock (bioluminescent cultivation), Säide-Current (bioelectric from Säidesolu), and Deep-Source (mysterious primordial power from below). This document details production, distribution, economics, and political control of Orrovae's energy infrastructure.

## THE THREE POWER SOURCES

### Quick Comparison

| Source | Type | Scale | Cost | Control | Sustainability |
|--------|------|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| Glowstock | Biological | Small-Medium | Low-Moderate | Spore Houses | Renewable |
| Säide-Current | Bioelectric | Medium | Moderate-High | Writ-Doctors | Depends on hosts |

## GLOWSTOCK (Bioluminescent Power)

### What It Is

**Definition**: Cultivated bioluminescent organisms (fungi, bacteria, algae-analogs) that produce light and low-level power

**Primary Use**: Lighting (90% of all underground illumination)
**Secondary Use**: Low-power devices (clocks, small motors, heating pads)
**Limitations**: Cannot provide high power (no heavy machinery, no large-scale manufacturing)

---

### Production Methods

#### Method 1: VAT CULTIVATION

**Process**:
1. Grow bioluminescent microorganisms in liquid medium
2. Feed nutrients (organic waste, minerals, water)
3. Harvest light output (organisms remain in vat)
4. Replace medium periodically (weekly to monthly)

**Scale**: Individual vats (1-100 liters) to industrial tanks (1,000-10,000 liters)

**Output**: 
- Small vat: Equivalent to candle (0.01 lumens continuous)
- Large tank: Equivalent to oil lamp (0.1-1 lumens continuous)
- Industrial: Equivalent to gas light (1-10 lumens continuous)

**Cost**: 
- Setup: Moderate (vat, starter culture, nutrients)
- Maintenance: Low (weekly feeding, monthly cleaning)
- Lifespan: Indefinite (culture propagates)

**Advantages**:
- Safe (no fire, no toxic fumes)
- Renewable (organisms reproduce)
- Quiet (no machinery)
- Säidesolu-compatible (bioelectric interference minimal)

**Disadvantages**:
- Dim (even large vats relatively dark)
- Requires constant care (neglect = culture death)
- Temperature sensitive (too cold/hot = output drops)
- Smells (organic, mushroom-like odor)

---

#### Method 2: TRAY CULTIVATION

**Process**:
1. Grow fungi/algae on solid medium (rock slabs, organic mats)
2. Keep moist and fed
3. Harvest fruiting bodies periodically (replaces itself)
4. Light output continuous from mat surface

**Scale**: Hand-sized (personal lamp) to wall-sized (room illumination)

**Output**:
- Personal: Candle-equivalent
- Room: Multiple candles
- Hall: Dim ambient (like moonlight)

**Cost**:
- Setup: Low (just medium and starter)
- Maintenance: Very low (misting, occasional feeding)
- Lifespan: Years (if maintained)

**Advantages**:
- Portable (can carry tray)
- Low maintenance
- Decorative (fungi patterns)
- No containers (grows on any surface)

**Disadvantages**:
- Even dimmer than vats
- Dries out (requires humidity)
- Spreads (can contaminate unwanted areas)
- Attracts pests (ashcrawlers love it)

---

#### Method 3: FILTER BED CULTIVATION

**Process**:
1. Build multi-layer filter system
2. Flow water through (carries nutrients)
3. Bioluminescent bacteria colonize filter
4. Light output + water purification simultaneously

**Scale**: Household (small filter) to civic (massive filtration complex)

**Output**:
- Household: Nightlight equivalent
- Civic: Streetlight equivalent (diffuse, widespread)

**Cost**:
- Setup: High (plumbing, construction)
- Maintenance: Low (self-sustaining if water flows)
- Lifespan: Decades (rock filters last, bacteria propagate)

**Advantages**:
- Dual purpose (light + clean water)
- Very low maintenance
- Scales well (larger = more light)
- Safe (enclosed system)

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires water infrastructure
- Dim (lowest output per volume)
- Fixed installation (can't move)
- Fails if water stops (bacteria die)

---

### Glowstock Strains

**White-Glow** (*Luminous alba*):
- Cool white light
- Most common (general illumination)
- Moderate output
- Hardy (survives neglect)
- Cost: Cheap

**Blue-Glow** (*Luminous caeruleus*):
- Blue-white light
- Medical applications (shows blood, infections clearly)
- High output (brighter than white)
- Delicate (requires careful maintenance)
- Cost: Expensive

**Red-Glow** (*Luminous rubra*):
- Red-orange light
- Night vision preservation (doesn't ruin dark adaptation)
- Low output (very dim)
- Hardy
- Cost: Moderate

**Green-Glow** (*Luminous viridis*):
- Green light
- Plant growth (helps underground agriculture)
- Moderate output
- Smells bad (sulfurous)
- Cost: Moderate

**Null-Glow** (Dark Variant):
- No visible light (infrared only)
- Heat production (warming)
- Specialty use (heating pads, foot-warmers)
- Hardy
- Cost: Cheap

---

### Economics and Control

**Spore House Monopoly**:
- Major Spore Houses control glowstock production
- Starter cultures proprietary (can't breed without license)
- Nutrient formulas secret (optimal growth requires buying their feed)
- Quality control (certified strains vs. black market)

**Pricing Structure**:
- Starter culture: Expensive (initial purchase)
- Nutrient feed: Moderate (ongoing cost)
- Replacement cultures: Moderate (when contaminated)
- Premium strains (blue-glow, specialty): Very expensive

**Class Divide**:
- **Upper tier**: Multiple high-output vats, premium strains, perfect illumination
- **Midworks**: Standard vats, white-glow, adequate light
- **Sumpward**: Small trays, dim light, shared sources
- **Underdeck**: Scavenged cultures, contaminated strains, mostly darkness

**Political Implications**:
- Light = quality of life
- Spore Houses control light = control daily experience
- Darkness used as punishment (shut off supply)
- "Light riots" when Spore Houses raise prices

## Säide-Current (Bioelectric Power)

### What It Is

**Definition**: Electrical current generated by Säidesolu-bearing organisms

**Discovery**: Säidesolu partnerships produce measurable bioelectricity (similar to electric eels)
**Harvesting**: Can be extracted without harming Säidesolu (if done carefully)
**Output**: Higher power than glowstock (can run machinery, not just lights)

---

### Generation Mechanisms

**How Säidesolu Produces Electricity**:
- Säidesolu uses electrical signaling for communication
- Repair processes generate byproduct current
- Can be amplified with proper nutrition
- "Spinning up" effect (Säidesolu works harder, more output)

**Factors Affecting Output**:
- **Säidesolu strain**: Some strains generate more (Strongarm, Ironroot high; Silverthread low)
- **Host health**: Well-fed, rested host = better output
- **Covenant**: Must permit harvesting (some forbid)
- **Säidesolu cooperation**: Willing Säidesolu produces more than coerced

---

### Harvesting Methods

#### Method 1: VOLUNTARY DONATION

**Process**:
1. Willing host connects to harvesting apparatus
2. Säidesolu "spins up" (increases activity)
3. Electrical current flows through contacts (skin-surface electrodes)
4. Session lasts 30-60 minutes
5. Host compensated (money or services)

**Output**: 
- Single donor: 10-50 watts continuous (during session)
- Donor pool (rotating shifts): 100-500 watts continuous

**Cost**:
- Donor compensation: Moderate to high
- Equipment: Low (simple electrodes, storage)
- Overhead: Scheduling, facilities

**Advantages**:
- Ethical (consensual)
- Reliable (donors return regularly)
- Higher quality (willing Säidesolu produces cleaner current)
- Legal (all jurisdictions)

**Disadvantages**:
- Expensive (labor cost)
- Limited output (individual donors can't sustain long sessions)
- Requires healthy hosts (poor nutrition = poor output)

**Social Dynamics**:
- Respectable work (especially if well-paid)
- Or desperate (if poorly paid)
- Some donate altruistically (community service)
- Others need money (poverty)

---

#### Method 2: VAT-CULTURE HARVESTING

**Process**:
1. Grow Säidesolu colonies without human hosts
2. Säidesolu forms living mat in nutrient bath
3. Constant electrical output (Säidesolu always active)
4. Harvested continuously

**Output**:
- Small vat: 50-100 watts continuous
- Large industrial: 500-1000 watts continuous

**Cost**:
- Setup: Very high (growing orphaned Säidesolu difficult)
- Maintenance: High (specific nutrients, temperature control)
- Efficiency: Good (24/7 output)

**Advantages**:
- No human labor needed
- Constant output (not session-based)
- Scalable (bigger vats = more power)

**Disadvantages**:
- Expensive to set up
- Säidesolu in vats "suffer"? (ethical debate)
- Lower output per Säidesolu mass (without host optimization)
- Failure-prone (vat infections kill entire culture)

**Ethical Concerns**:
- Is orphaned Säidesolu conscious? (Debate)
- Is this exploitation? (Some say yes)
- Religious objections (some doctrines forbid)

---

#### Method 3: SURFACE CREATURE HARVESTING

**Process**:
1. Capture surface creatures (Säidesolu-bearing)
2. Force harvesting (imprisonment, electrodes)
3. Extract until creature dies or Säidesolu dies
4. Replace with new capture

**Output**:
- Variable (depends on creature)
- Gleaners: High (human-sized, aggressive Säidesolu)
- Stonegrazers: Moderate (large but slow Säidesolu)

**Cost**:
- Capture: High (dangerous, requires surface runs)
- Facilities: High (containment, security)
- Lifespan: Low (creatures/Säidesolu die quickly under stress)

**Advantages**:
- High output (some surface creatures very powerful)
- No human exploitation (ethical in some views)

**Disadvantages**:
- Dangerous (capturing surface creatures)
- Expensive (high turnover, constant captures needed)
- Morally gray (creature suffering)
- Illegal in some jurisdictions (Gleaners too human-like)

---

#### Method 4: HOLLOWED EXPLOITATION (Darkest Method)

**Process**:
1. Use Hollowed people as power sources
2. Säidesolu in full control (maximum output)
3. Hollowed "consents" (claims to be happy)
4. Harvesting continuous until death

**Output**:
- Per Hollowed: 100-200 watts continuous
- Industrial scale: Thousands of watts (battery farms)

**Cost**:
- Acquisition: Variable (depends on how obtained)
- Maintenance: Low (Hollowed people compliant)
- Lifespan: Months to years (overwork kills)

**Advantages** (from exploiter's view):
- Very high output
- Compliant workers (Hollowed don't resist)
- Cheap (minimal compensation needed)

**Disadvantages**:
- Morally abhorrent (slavery, exploitation)
- Illegal (most jurisdictions, poorly enforced)
- Unstable (Hollowed eventually die)
- Social unrest (if public learns about it)

**The Horror**:
- Hollowed people claim happiness (they genuinely feel it)
- Observers see exploitation
- Who's right?
- This is why Hollowing is political

---

### Säide-Current Infrastructure

**Distribution**:
- Wiring (copper, iron, specialty alloys)
- Storage (batteries, capacitor-analogs)
- Converters (bioelectric to mechanical)

**Uses**:
- Manufacturing (machinery, forges, mills)
- Transportation (hoists, rail cars)
- Communication (signal networks, alarms)

- Arena (Golem power, match infrastructure)

**Control**:
- Writ-Doctors regulate (medical authority over Säidesolu)
- Power brokers (buy/sell/distribute)
- Industrial users (major consumers)
- Black market (illegal harvesting, Hollowed farms)

**Pricing**:
- Voluntary donation: Expensive (labor cost)
- Vat-culture: Moderate (initial investment high, ongoing low)
- Surface creatures: Variable (depends on capture success)
- Hollowed exploitation: Cheap (unethically low cost)

---

## DEEP-SOURCE (Primordial Power)

### What It Is

**Definition**: Mysterious power source from deep underground (Level 4-5)

**Characteristics**:
- Very high output (hundreds to thousands of watts per tap)
- Reliable (constant flow, doesn't deplete)
- Dangerous (exposure causes strange effects)
- Unexplained (mechanism unknown)

**Theories**:

**Theory 1: Primordial Säidesolu Colonies**
- Deep underground = massive ancient Säidesolu super-colonies
- Pre-Scouring (possibly millions of years old)
- Bioelectric output from colony-mind
- Tapping = parasitizing ancient organism

**Theory 2: Geothermal Conversion**
- Heat from planetary core
- Converted to electricity via unknown means
- Natural or artificial converter
- Sustainable indefinitely

**Theory 3: Mineral Metabolism**
- Certain deep minerals chemically active
- Produce electricity as byproduct
- Slow consumption (regenerates geologically)
- Finite but very long-lasting

**Theory 4: Pre-Scouring Technology**
- Ancient power plants still running
- Maintenance-free (or self-maintaining)
- Don't understand but can tap
- Could fail catastrophically

**Theory 5: Something Else Entirely**
- None of the above
- Fundamentally unknown
- Possibly dangerous to investigate
- "Don't look gift horse in mouth"

**Academic Consensus**: Unknown (insufficient data)

---

### Extraction Methods

**Deep Drilling**:
- Drill down to Level 4-5 (kilometers)
- Tap into "veins" (zones of high output)
- Install extraction apparatus
- Maintain connection

**Challenges**:
- Extreme depth (structural engineering)
- Unstable geology (collapses, flooding)
- Unknown hazards (strange phenomena)
- High cost (years of work, massive resources)

**Output**:
- Single tap: 500-5,000 watts continuous
- Major extraction site: Tens of thousands of watts
- Scales with depth (deeper = more power)

**Risks**:
- Cave-ins (deadly, expensive)
- "Deep sickness" (workers develop strange symptoms)
- Tap failures (sudden loss of power, sometimes explosive)
- Unknown consequences (what are we disturbing?)

---

### Deep-Source Effects

**Physical Effects**:
- Warmth (areas near taps unusually warm)
- Hum (low-frequency vibration, felt not heard)
- Light (sometimes taps glow faintly)
- Magnetic anomalies (compasses fail)

**Biological Effects**:
- Säidesolu agitation (partnerships stressed)
- Unusual healing (faster but stranger)
- Drift acceleration (workers optimize rapidly)
- Fertility changes (births increase near taps - or decrease, inconsistent reports)

**Psychological Effects**:
- Dreams (vivid, shared between workers)
- Unease (feeling watched)
- Compulsion (drawn to deeper exploration)
- Madness (some workers break mentally)

**The Mystery**:
- Are these side effects dangerous?
- Or are they communication attempts?
- Is something alive down there?
- Should we keep drilling?

---

### Control and Politics

**Deep Guilds**:
- Specialized organizations (drilling, extraction, maintenance)
- Secretive (don't share knowledge)
- Wealthy (Deep-Source very profitable)
- Powerful (energy = political leverage)

**Access Restriction**:
- Only guilds can drill (legally)
- Licenses required
- Sites guarded (valuable, dangerous)
- Knowledge hoarded (competitive advantage)

**Economic Impact**:
- Cities with Deep-Source taps = industrial powerhouses
- Manufacturing, Arena, large-scale projects possible
- Cities without = dependent on Glowstock and Säide-Current
- Massive inequality

**Conspiracy Theories**:
- Deep Guilds know more than they say
- Deliberately restricting taps (artificial scarcity)
- Something terrible discovered (being hidden)
- Pre-Scouring civilization survivors below (being contacted or exploited)

---

## POWER DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE
