# TECHNOLOGY BASELINE

## Overview

Orrovae's technology level is constrained by available resources, power limitations, and 10,000 years of knowledge loss from the Scouring. This document establishes what exists, what doesn't exist, and why - providing clear boundaries for storytelling and worldbuilding consistency.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: 1860s-1880s EQUIVALENT

### Why This Era?

**Power Availability**:
- Steam, gas, early electricity (matches Glowstock/Säide-Current/Deep-Source)
- Mechanical engineering sophisticated
- Pre-mass-electrification (fits power constraints)

**Materials Science**:
- Iron/steel production
- Chemical processes (basic)
- No plastics, no advanced alloys
- Matches underground resource availability

**Knowledge Base**:
- Post-Scientific Revolution
- Engineering principles understood
- But: Pre-quantum mechanics, pre-relativity
- Fits Scouring knowledge-loss + recovery

**Social Structure**:
- Industrial
