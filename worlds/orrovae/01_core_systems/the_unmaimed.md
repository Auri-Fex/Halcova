## OVERVIEW

The Unmaimed (*Ehjättomat* in Hollowspeech) is the political and philosophical movement that transforms the Maiming Wars from scattered violence into systematic atrocity. What began as fringe interpretation of Fivefold Fortitude became the dominant ideology justifying maiming as a tool of social purification.

## FOUNDING

### Origins (15 Years Before Book 1)

**The Philosophical Seed**:
A Säide-Writ scholar named **Kalev Honkasaari** published a treatise: *Pattern and Purpose: A New Reading of Fortitude*. His argument:

> "The Säidesolu does not merely heal—it *tests*. Each wound is a question: does this Pattern deserve to continue? Those who regenerate fully have answered well. Those who cannot—whose wounds exceed their Pattern's capacity—have revealed a weakness that should not be passed forward through the Thread."

Honkasaari was not advocating violence. He was explaining why some people Hollow and others don't, through a Fortitude lens. But his ideas were seized by those who wanted justification.

**The Political Catalyst**:
Three years after Honkasaari's treatise, a labor dispute in the Deepworks turned violent. Striking workers were injured; management claimed they couldn't afford medical treatment. When several workers Hollowed from untreated wounds, the owner—**Aldric Vessberg** (father of Councillor Mira Vessberg)—declared:

> "The Thread has judged them. Their Patterns lacked the Fortitude for the work. Better they revealed this now than passed their weakness to the next generation."

This was the first public use of Honkasaari's framework to justify letting people suffer.

### Formation (8 Years Before Book 1)

**The Vanguard**:
A group of Fortitude doctrine adherents formalized Aldric's approach into organized philosophy. They called themselves *Ehjättomat*—"Those Without Blemish." Founding members included:

- **Cynewulf Bracebreaker** (then called Cynewulf Stonehall) | Enforcer, later leader
- **Asta Ironthread** (sister of Satu Ironthread) | Doctrine theologian
- **Collector Harjen** | Ledger administrator, record-keeper
- **Vestor Grundholm** (later "the Harvester") | Resources/logistics

**The Manifesto**: *Return-to-Post: A Program for Pattern Purity*

Core claims:
1. The Thread carries weakness forward through damaged Patterns
2. Maiming reveals weak Patterns before they can reproduce
3. Culling the maimed protects future generations
4. True Fortitude accepts this sacrifice
5. Those who object lack Fortitude themselves

## BELIEFS

### Core Tenets

**1. The Test Doctrine**
> "Every wound is a question the Säide asks of your Pattern. Answer well, or answer not at all."

The Säide doesn't just heal—it judges. Regeneration is proof of Pattern strength. Failure to regenerate proves Pattern weakness.

**2. The Lineage Imperative**
> "What you cannot heal, you must not pass forward."

Building on Thread-Memory fears, The Unmaimed argue that damaged Patterns corrupt future generations. Maiming someone is therefore a *kindness*—preventing them from spreading their weakness.

**3. The Community Shield**
> "We suffer few so many may flourish."

Mass maiming is framed as community protection. "Yes, individuals are harmed. But the Thread grows stronger. Future generations benefit from our sacrifice."

**4. The Natural Order**
> "We do not create weakness—we reveal it."

The Unmaimed claim they're not *causing* anything. They're simply exposing what was already true. If someone couldn't survive the test, the weakness existed before the test.

**5. The Mercy Principle**
> "Better to know today than to Hollow tomorrow."

Since damaged Patterns lead to increased Hollowing risk, revealing weakness now prevents the greater tragedy of Hollowing later. Maiming is positioned as preventive care.

### The Hierarchy of Worth

The Unmaimed rank people by their Pattern's "proven" strength:

| Tier | Description | Treatment |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Proven** | Recovered from severe injury without drift | Full citizens, leadership eligible |
| **Untested** | Never seriously injured | Provisional status, await testing |
| **Marked** | Recovered but with visible drift | Second-class, breeding restricted |
| **Damaged** | Failed to recover fully | No rights, may be euthanized |
| **Hollow** | Säide-dominant | Property, not persons |
| **Unseeded** | No Säide | Non-persons (below Hollow) |

## ORGANIZATION

### Structure

**The Core (Leadership)**:
- **The Arbiter** | Current: Cynewulf Bracebreaker | Final doctrinal authority
- **The Voice** | Current: Asta Ironthread | Public messaging, recruitment
- **The Collector** | Current: Harjen | Records, Pattern-tracking
- **The Provider** | Current: Vestor the Harvester | Resources, enforcement

**The Trials (Regional Leadership)**:
Each major Hold has a Trial—a council of five Proven members who implement doctrine locally. They:
- Identify "weak Patterns" in the population
- Coordinate "testing events"
- Manage Hollowed resources
- Report to the Core

**The Tested (Membership)**:
Rank-and-file members who have:
- Passed their own testing (recovered from significant injury)
- Sworn the Return-to-Post oath
- Contributed to at least one "purification action"

**The Watchers (Informants)**:
Non-members who report Pattern weakness in their communities. Motivated by:
- Payment
- Protection (won't be tested if they cooperate)
- Belief (agree with doctrine but won't act directly)

### Membership

**Estimated Numbers (Book 1)**:
- Core: 4
- Trials: ~200 (across all Holds)
- Tested: ~5,000
- Watchers: ~50,000

**Recruitment Pathways**:
1. **Ideological** | True believers in Pattern purity
2. **Survival** | Join to avoid being targeted
3. **Revenge** | Want to hurt someone, doctrine provides excuse
4. **Economic** | Hollowed labor is profitable
5. **Political** | Ally with power structure

### Funding

- **Hollowed labor contracts** | Hollowed "donated" by members are rented out
- **Säide-Current harvesting** | Hollowed provide power
- **Political donations** | Sympathizers in industry and government
- **Confiscated assets** | Property of the "damaged" is seized

## SYMBOLS AND RITUALS

### The Symbols

**The Unbroken Circle**:
A circle with no gap—representing the undamaged Pattern. Worn as pins, carved into doorways, tattooed on Proven members.

**The Testing Mark**:
A scar deliberately given to Tested members during initiation. Location varies (arm, back, face) based on Trial traditions. Demonstrates willingness to be tested.

**The Return**:
A phrase and gesture. Words: "Return to post, or return to Thread." Gesture: Open hand pressed to chest, then extended outward (offering self to judgment).

### The Rituals

**The Testing Ceremony (Initiation)**:
New members receive a wound and must heal unaided (no Writ intervention). Those who heal cleanly are Proven. Those who heal with drift are Marked but may still join at lower rank. Those who fail to heal are... dealt with.

**The Revelation (Targeting)**:
When the Trial identifies a "weak Pattern" for testing, they hold a Revelation—formal declaration of suspicion. The target is given seven days to disprove the accusation (usually impossible) or face testing.

**The Return (Execution)**:
Those who fail testing are "Returned to Thread"—either euthanasia (if damaged) or forced Hollowing (if salvageable as labor). Framed as religious duty, not murder.

**The Accounting (Record-Keeping)**:
The Collector maintains meticulous records of every Pattern tested, every failure revealed, every Thread "strengthened." This creates both legal protection (we followed procedure) and psychological distance (numbers, not people).

## DOCTRINE EVOLUTION

### Phase 1: Philosophical (Years -15 to -8)
Honkasaari's ideas circulate among scholars. Occasional references in political discourse. No organized movement.

### Phase 2: Political (Years -8 to -3)
The Unmaimed form as advocacy group. Push for:
- Reduced treatment for "hopeless cases"
- Pattern registration requirements
- Breeding restrictions for the Marked
Limited success, significant opposition.

### Phase 3: Militant (Years -3 to War Start)
After repeated legislative failures, The Unmaimed go underground. Begin "direct action":
- Targeted attacks on reform advocates
- Hollowing of political opponents
- Intimidation of Säide-Writs who treat "weak Patterns"

### Phase 4: Dominant (Maiming Wars)
The Vessberg assassination (Councillor Mira) removes opposition leadership. Political climate shifts toward "strength." The Unmaimed emerge as mainstream faction:
- Government officials align publicly
- Military adopts testing protocols
- Maiming becomes official policy

### Phase 5: Collapse (Books 4-5)
Everyone is maimed by now. The doctrine's own logic condemns its adherents. Internal purges begin—members test each other. Movement fractures between:
- **Absolutists** | Anyone damaged must go (including us)
- **Pragmatists** | The doctrine served its purpose; time to adapt
- **Disillusioned** | We became what we claimed to fight

## KEY FIGURES

### Cynewulf Bracebreaker (The Arbiter)

**Birth Name**: Cynewulf Stonehall
**Naming Origin**: Anglo-Saxon Revival ("Royal-bold")
**Title Origin**: Broke his own arm to prove Pattern strength; healed without drift

**Background**:
Second son of minor noble family, no inheritance coming. Enlisted in military, demonstrated unusual regeneration capacity after severe injuries. Became convinced his Pattern was exceptional. Met Honkasaari, found theological framework for his self-regard. Transformed personal vanity into political movement.

**Psychology**:
- Genuinely believes in doctrine (rare among leadership)
- Sees himself as tragic hero sacrificing comfort for necessity
- Does not enjoy violence—considers it duty
- Increasingly isolated as movement grows (no one meets his standards)

**Role in Story**:
Primary antagonist Books 2-4. Present at major atrocities. Killed in Book 4 when the peace summit is revealed as trap—but by his own people, who've decided he's outlived usefulness.

---

### Asta Ironthread (The Voice)

**Naming Origin**: Finno-Ugric hybrid ("Love" + craft-name)
**Relation**: Sister of Satu Ironthread (Shaper who later defects)

**Background**:
Brilliant theologian, originally orthodox Fivefold scholar. Converted to Unmaimed doctrine after her brother's construct experiments were condemned. Saw Pattern purity as answer to societal chaos. Became the movement's public face—eloquent, reasonable-sounding, terrifying in implication.

**Psychology**:
- True believer who knows how to phrase horror as philosophy
- Deep insecurity about her own Pattern (never seriously injured)
- Relationship with Cynewulf is complicated (intellectual partnership, possible more)
- Will eventually betray the movement when her brother defects (Book 4)

**Role in Story**:
The voice readers hear explaining doctrine. Makes horror sound logical.

---

### Vestor the Harvester (The Provider)

**Birth Name**: Vestor Grundholm  
**Naming Origin**: Germanic-Industrial
**Title Origin**: Developed efficient systems for extracting value from Hollowed

**Background**:
Industrial manager before joining The Unmaimed. Saw Hollowed labor as underutilized resource. Approached the movement with business proposal: "Let me handle logistics; I'll make us self-funding." Created the Harvesting operations that turn doctrine into profit.

**Psychology**:
- Doesn't care about doctrine—cares about efficiency
- Sees people as resources (Hollowed or not)
- Genuinely puzzled by moral objections
- Will abandon movement instantly when it stops being profitable

**Role in Story**:
The face of exploitation. Killed by constructs in Book 3—they remember what he did.

## OPPOSITION

### Who Fights The Unmaimed

**Reform Faction**:
Believe in Fivefold Fortitude but reject corrupted interpretation. Argue:
- True Fortitude is adaptation, not purity
- The Säide heals because healing is good
- Pattern damage is tragedy, not judgment

**Plain Condition Movement** (Unseeded):
Reject Säide partnership entirely. Argue:
- The Unmaimed prove symbiosis was a mistake
- Freedom from Säide = freedom from Hollowing
- Humanity survived before Säide; can again

**Säide-Writ Opposition**:
Medical professionals who refuse to participate. Argue:
- Healing is duty, not judgment
- Pattern testing violates Covenant ethics
- Weaponized Hollowing is murder

**The Surface Alternative**:
As war progresses, some begin wondering if surface creatures have the right idea. They adapted instead of purifying. They survived without destroying themselves.

## STORY APPLICATIONS

### For Eneko (Lane D)
Unseeded are below Hollow in Unmaimed hierarchy. Eneko's community faces existential threat—either submit to testing (impossible without Säide) or flee. His political work is survival.

### For Sigurd (Lane B)
Sigurd's research makes him target—countermeasures threaten the movement. His Hollowing is not natural; it's induced by those who want him silenced.

### For Torven (Lane A)
His client in Book 1 is marked for Revelation. Protecting her means opposing The Unmaimed directly.

### For Helmar (Lane E)
Helmar files the paperwork that enables it all. He doesn't pull triggers—he creates forms that authorize testing, logs results that prove legality. His dramatic irony: he'll be consumed by the system he maintained.

### For Kaisa (Lane C)
Her mixed-strain Säide marks her as "impure Pattern." The Unmaimed would cull her on principle. Her survival depends on staying useful and invisible.

## QUOTATIONS FOR DIALOGUE

**Cynewulf Bracebreaker**:
> "I take no pleasure in necessity. But the Thread must be protected from those who would fray it."

> "You call us cruel. The Thread calls us gardeners."

> "The Hollowed are not our victims. They are our warnings."

**Vestor the Harvester**:
> "A Hollowed worker feels no pain, needs no rest, makes no complaints. Call that whatever you want. I call it efficiency."

**The Return-to-Post Oath**:
> "I offer my Pattern to the Thread's judgment. Let my healing prove my worth. Let my failure serve the many. Return-to-Post, or return to Thread."
