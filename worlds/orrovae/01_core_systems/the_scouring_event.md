# THE SCOURING EVENT

## Overview

The Scouring is the catastrophic event that ended surface civilization and drove humanity underground approximately 10,000 years ago. This document provides complete details on what happened, the scientific framework, geological evidence, evolutionary consequences, and the myths and theories that have emerged in the millennia since.

## THE EVENT: WHAT HAPPENED

### Timeline Summary

**10,000+ Years Before Present (YBP)**: Surface civilization at unknown technological level

**~10,000 YBP**: THE SCOURING BEGINS
- Solar spectral shift occurs
- Atmosphere begins failing
- Mass casualties commence
- Evacuation underground begins (if organized) or happens in panic

**~10,000 - 9,500 YBP**: THE DYING
- Surface becomes progressively uninhabitable
- Final evacuation waves (desperation)
- Massive population loss (estimated 90-99% of pre-Scouring population)
- Underground adaptation begins
- Technology/knowledge loss catastrophic

**~9,500 - 7,000 YBP**: THE DESCENT ERA
- Full underground adaptation
- Keelkin-human partnership emerges/solidifies
- Cultural divergence accelerates
- Surface becomes forbidden/impossible

**~7,000 YBP - Present**: POST-SCOURING CIVILIZATION
- Surface remains lethal but necessary (actinic goods)
- Short procurement runs become standard
- Current Orrovae culture emerges
- Myths about the Scouring crystallize

## SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK

### The Stellar Shift

**What Happened to the Sun**:
- Star underwent spectral class shift
- Previous: G-type yellow dwarf (like Earth's sun)
- Current: K-type orange dwarf (cooler, different radiation profile)

**Why This Happened**:
- Unknown to current Orrovae science (knowledge lost)
- Theories exist (covered in Theories section below)
- No scientific consensus
- May have been: Natural stellar evolution (unusual/premature), cosmic event (collision, near-miss), artificial (ancient weapon/experiment), or something else entirely

**Observable Evidence**:
- Sun visibly different color (orange-tinted, not yellow)
- Spectral analysis shows K-type signature
- Historical texts (pre-Scouring ruins) describe "yellow sun"
- Auroral patterns inconsistent with stable star

**Radiation Changes**:
- Shift introduced new wavelength bands ("actinic radiation")
- These wavelengths interact destructively with Earth-origin biology
- Not immediately lethal but progressively damaging
- Cumulative exposure = death

---

### Atmospheric Collapse

**What Happened to the Atmosphere**:
- Protective layers stripped or damaged
- Ozone layer destroyed or fundamentally altered
- Magnetosphere disrupted or weakened
- Atmospheric chemistry changed

**Mechanism** (Theoretical):
- Solar wind increased after shift
- Actinic radiation catalyzed atmospheric breakdown
- Cascading chemistry failure
- Runaway effect (once started, couldn't stop)

**Observable Evidence**:
- Permanent auroral scarring (visible day and night)
- Sky color wrong (amber-grey, not blue)
- Atmospheric shimmer (electromagnetic, not thermal)
- Chemical analysis of surface air (toxic trace compounds)
- Pressure lower than expected for planet this size

**Timeline**:
- Not instantaneous (took months to years)
- Progressive worsening
- Brief windows of "better" conditions (false hope)
- Eventually: Permanent hostile state

---

### Actinic Radiation

**What It Is**:
- Specific wavelength bands in new solar output
- Approximately 280-320nm range (similar to UV-B/C but shifted)
- Penetrates atmosphere more effectively than pre-Scouring UV
- Interacts with biological molecules destructively

**Biological Effects** (See `actinic_exposure_complete.md` for full details):
- Disrupts Keelkin-host partnership
- Photochemical damage to proteins
- Oxidative cascade in cells
- Neural signaling interference
- Cumulative and irreversible

**Why Underground Is Safe**:
- Rock/earth blocks actinic radiation
- Even thin layer (meters) provides protection
- Depth = safety (exponential protection)
- Cave systems become sanctuary

**The Paradox**:
- Actinic exposure required to produce actinic goods
- Surface materials undergo useful transformations
- Sterile ash, sun-cured salts, photoreactive resins
- Underground civilization dependent on surface procurement

---

## GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

### Surface Scarring

**Ruins of Pre-Scouring Civilization**:

**Cities**:
- Massive urban centers (populations millions?)
- Architecture unknown style (not current Orrovae patterns)
- Materials: Stone (bleached white), metal (corroded to lace), glass (melted organic shapes)
- Structural damage: Not collapsed (too damaged to collapse), standing but fragile, geometry distorted by millennia of actinic exposure

**Distinctive Damage Patterns**:
- **Bleaching**: All colored materials turned white/pale
- **Corrosion**: Metal oxidized in unusual patterns (lace-like filigree)
- **Glass melting**: Windows/glass flowed like wax, organic shapes
- **Stone cracking**: Geometric fracture patterns (not weathering, something else)
- **Organic preservation**: None (all organic matter destroyed)

**What This Tells Us**:
- Civilization was advanced (large-scale construction, complex materials)
- Destruction was gradual (structures still standing, not blasted)
- Actinic radiation causes specific damage signatures
- Time scale: 10,000 years of exposure = complete material transformation

---

### Stratigraphic Record

**The Scouring Layer**:
- Distinct geological boundary ~10,000 YBP
- Above: Pre-Scouring materials (organic-rich, normal composition)
- Below: Post-Scouring materials (ash layer, altered chemistry, no organics)

**Composition**:
- Dense ash layer (global)
- Chemical signatures of atmospheric burning
- Iridium anomaly (disputed - some say yes, some say no)
- Organic molecule breakdown products
- Radioactive isotope anomalies (not natural decay pattern)

**What This Tells Us**:
- Event was global (ash layer worldwide)
- Atmospheric interaction (burning/chemistry)
- Sudden biological collapse (organic cessation)
- Possible cosmic component (isotope anomalies)

---

### Fossil Record

**Last Surface Life**:
- Pre-Scouring: Rich biosphere (Earth-analog species)
- Scouring boundary: Mass extinction
- Post-Scouring: 1,000+ year gap (no fossils)
- Re-emergence: Adapted species (actinic-tolerant, fundamentally different)

**Extinction Pattern**:
- Surface species: 95-99% extinction
- Underground species: High survival (caves, deep burrows)
- Marine species: Variable (deep ocean survived better)
- Plants: Near-total surface extinction

**Re-adaptation Timeline**:
- 0-1,000 years: Dead zone (nothing on surface)
- 1,000-3,000 years: First pioneer species (extremophiles)
- 3,000-7,000 years: Adapted ecosystem emerges
- 7,000-present: Stable hostile biosphere

---

## EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES

### Surface Life Adaptations

**All surviving surface species share**:
- Actinic tolerance (various mechanisms)
- Dark coloration (black, deep purple, not green)
- Shielding structures (thick cuticle, reflective surfaces, constant shedding)
- Rapid life cycles OR extreme dormancy
- Bioluminescence (surface is dark due to atmospheric changes)

**Specific Adaptations**:

**Flora**:
- Black/purple photosynthesis (different chemistry)
- Spore clouds (reproductive strategy)
- Mineral-eating (no soil, rock-breaking roots)
- Stone-mimicry (camouflage from herbivores)

**Fauna**:
- Carapaced (hard shells, reflective)
- Nocturnal/crepuscular (avoid peak actinic)
- Subterranean refuges (burrow during day)
- Actinic-powered metabolism (rare, terrifying)

**Former-Human Species** (The Horror):
- 10,000 years of evolution from trapped surface humans
- Actinic-tolerant strains of Keelkin
- Bodies optimized for hostile environment
- Intelligence remains (reduced but present)
- Behaviors uncanny (Keelkin "remembers" hosting humans)

---

### Underground Life Isolation

**Divergence**:
- Underground species isolated from surface
- 10,000 years = significant evolutionary time
- Adaptations to permanent darkness, stable temperature, unique food sources

**Results**:
- Bioluminescence common
- Eye reduction in some species
- Enhanced other senses (chemical, vibration, magnetic)
- Symbiosis frequent (including Keelkin partnerships)

**The Keelkin Question**:
- Did Keelkin exist pre-Scouring?
- Or did Scouring create conditions for Keelkin emergence?
- Evidence for both theories
- Current consensus: Probably existed, but became essential post-Scouring

---

## VISUAL SIGNATURES OF THE SCOURING

### The Sky

**Pre-Scouring** (from historical texts):
- Blue sky
- Yellow sun
- White clouds
- Normal stars at night

**Post-Scouring** (current):
- Amber-grey sky (sickly color)
- Orange sun (K-type star)
- Auroral bands crawl across sky during day (permanent, not just night)
- Atmospheric shimmer (electromagnetic, not heat)
- "Heavy" light (feels oppressive, described by surface runners)
- Shadows wrong colors (blue-violet tint, not grey)
- Stars dimmed by atmospheric interference

---

### The Ruins

**Distinctive Visual Elements**:

**Color**:
- Everything bleached white/pale
- No color remains (pigments destroyed)
- Metal oxidized to rust-lace (orange/brown filigree)
- Glass melted to organic shapes (frozen flow)

**Texture**:
- Stone cracked in geometric patterns
- Buildings look "etched" (surface detail eroded)
- Metal fragile (lace-like, breaks easily)
- Glass smooth but distorted

**Light Interaction**:
- Ruins shimmer in actinic light (iridescent quality)
- Shadows strange (actinic interference)
- Reflections distorted (glass surface altered)

**Atmosphere**:
- Silence (no birds, no wind rustle through leaves)
- Sterile (no growth, no decay, frozen in time)
- Hostile (body knows this is wrong place)
- Beautiful (in terrible way - alien aesthetics)

---

### Surface Creatures

**Visual Characteristics**:
- Black/deep purple coloration
- Reflective surfaces (carapaces, scales)
- Bioluminescence in shadows
- Constant shedding (skin/shell layers)
- Geometric patterns (not organic curves)
- "Wrong" proportions (actinic-optimized bodies)

**Movement**:
- Jerky/sudden (not smooth mammalian motion)
- Freeze response to actinic peaks
- Shelter-seeking behavior (constant awareness of light levels)
- Pack coordination (if social species)

**The Former-Humans** (Most Disturbing):
- Bipedal but wrong proportions
- Carapaced skin (thick, armored)
- Eyes adapted (large, reflective)
- Hands still present (tool use retained?)
- Build nests, arrange objects
- Try to communicate (vocalizations uncanny)
- Remember something (behaviors suggest memory of civilization)

---

## PRE-SCOURING CIVILIZATION

### What We Know

**From Ruins**:
- Large urban centers (scale comparable to current major cities)
- Advanced construction (materials, techniques unknown now)
- Complex infrastructure (systems not fully understood)
- Global distribution (ruins on all continents)
- Sudden abandonment (mid-activity evidence)

**From Artifacts**:
- Tools (functions unclear, materials degraded)
- Writings (languages lost, scripts undeciphered mostly)
- Art (styles alien to current Orrovae aesthetics)
- Technology (fragments only, purposes unknown)

**From Deep Archives** (Underground preservation):
- Some texts survived (sealed chambers, deep vaults)
- Fragmentary records (incomplete, corrupted)
- Conflicting accounts (different cultures, different interpretations)
- Technical manuals (mostly incomprehensible)

---

### What We Don't Know

**Technology Level**:
- Higher than current Orrovae? (Probable)
- How much higher? (Unknown)
- Space-faring? (No evidence, but ruins suggest possibility)
- Energy sources? (Unknown - no power plants found intact)

**Population**:
- Billions? (Scale of ruins suggests large population)
- Distribution? (Global but concentrated)
- Diversity? (Evidence of multiple cultures)

**Organization**:
- Unified? (Some evidence of trade/communication networks)
- Fractured? (Distinct architectural styles suggest separate polities)
- Government types? (Unknown)

**Why Surface** (Crucial Question):
- If they could build underground cities (they clearly could, given current ruins found underground too)
- Why live on surface primarily?
- What was different about pre-Scouring surface? (Everything)

---

### The Warning Question

**Did They Know It Was Coming?**

**Evidence For**:
- Massive underground structures (prepared refuges?)
- Sealed chambers with supplies (evacuation prep?)
- Texts mentioning "the change" (prophetic or descriptive?)
- Some ruins show orderly departure (not pure panic)

**Evidence Against**:
- Many ruins show mid-activity abandonment (not prepared)
- Massive casualties (wouldn't happen if warned)
- Critical records not preserved (would save important knowledge)
- Underground refuges inadequate for population (not enough space)

**Current Academic Consensus**:
- Some warning existed (months to years)
- Not enough time to save everyone
- Knowledge of cause incomplete (didn't know how to prevent)
- Evacuation chaotic despite attempts at order
- Most died on surface or in early underground years

---

## MYTHS AND THEORIES

### Academic Theories (Scholarly)

#### Theory 1: Natural Stellar Evolution

**Premise**: Stars change over time; sun reached unstable phase

**Evidence For**:
- Stellar physics allows for rapid transitions
- No other explanation needed (Occam's Razor)
- Observed spectral shift consistent with natural process

**Evidence Against**:
- Timescale wrong (too fast for natural evolution)
- Sun type shouldn't shift like this
- Other K-type stars don't show same pattern

**Proponents**: Conservative academics, astrophysicists
**Status**: Minority position but respectable

---

#### Theory 2: Cosmic Impact/Near-Miss

**Premise**: Another stellar body passed near sun, disrupted it

**Evidence For**:
- Orbital mechanics allow this
- Would explain sudden shift
- Isotope anomalies in Scouring layer
- Magnetic field disruption

**Evidence Against**:
- No evidence of second stellar body now
- Physics unclear (what kind of pass causes spectral shift?)
- Convenient but unverifiable

**Proponents**: Disaster theorists, romantic academics
**Status**: Popular but unproven

---

#### Theory 3: Ancient Weapon/Experiment

**Premise**: Pre-Scouring civilization caused this (accident or war)

**Evidence For**:
- Pre-Scouring tech level unknown (could have been capable)
- Sudden onset (consistent with activation event)
- Ruins show evidence of conflict (disputed interpretation)
- Some texts mention "the weapon" (fragmentary, unclear)

**Evidence Against**:
- No mechanism identified (how would you change a star?)
- Why would anyone build this?
- Requires godlike technology (seems implausible)
- Convenient scapegoat (blame the dead)

**Proponents**: Conspiracy theorists, some radical academics
**Status**: Fringe but persistent

---

#### Theory 4: Cyclic Catastrophe

**Premise**: This has happened before, will happen again

**Evidence For**:
- Deep geological record shows possible prior extinction events
- Some ruins pre-date current "10,000 years ago" estimate
- Myths from multiple cultures mention "previous worlds"
- Keelkin might be older than current epoch (genetic memory?)

**Evidence Against**:
- Geological evidence disputed
- "Previous worlds" might be myths, not history
- No clear cycle pattern
- Unfalsifiable (can always claim "it's coming again")

**Proponents**: Catastrophists, some religious groups
**Status**: Speculative, minority

---

### Religious Interpretations

#### Bracefaith: The Necessary Trial

**Belief**: Scouring was divine test of strength

- Weak surface civilization destroyed (proved unworthy)
- Strong survivors underground (proved worthy)
- Actinic exposure is ongoing test (suffering builds strength)
- Those who thrive underground chosen by cosmic force

**Ritual Practice**: Voluntary actinic exposure (brief, controlled)
**Social Impact**: Justifies suffering, opposes comfort

---

#### Ladder of Altitude: The Fall

**Belief**: Surface was paradise, underground is punishment

- Pre-Scouring humans lived in elevated state (literally and metaphorically)
- Scouring was fall from grace (moral failure)
- Underground is purgatory (working toward redemption)
- Upward mobility mirrors spiritual ascent

**Ritual Practice**: Climb toward surface as prayer
**Social Impact**: Hierarchical society justified by theology

---

#### Plain Condition: The Liberation

**Belief**: Scouring freed humanity from false civilization

- Surface civilization was corrupt (technology, hierarchy, artifice)
- Scouring destroyed complexity (returned to essentials)
- Underground life is authentic (stripped of pretense)
- Keelkin partnership is trap (new complexity to avoid)

**Ritual Practice**: Simplicity, rejection of optimization
**Social Impact**: Unseeded movement theological foundation

---

#### Threadist Heresy: The Sundering

**Belief**: Keelkin were once unified colony-mind, Scouring split them

- Pre-Scouring: Keelkin existed as single consciousness
- Scouring: Forced fragmentation (survival adaptation)
- Current: Each Keelkin individual but yearns for reunion
- Hollowing: First step toward colony-mind restoration

**Ritual Practice**: Meditation on unity, Hollowing as transcendence
**Social Impact**: Hollowed communities, controversial theology

---

#### Actinic Pragmatists: No Meaning, Just Survival

**Belief**: Scouring happened, no deeper meaning, adapt or die

- Not religion, more anti-religious stance
- Focus on practical response (not why, but what now)
- Actinic goods necessary (use what kills you)
- No cosmic justice (randomness, not punishment or test)

**Ritual Practice**: Surface procurement runs as pragmatic necessity
**Social Impact**: Runner culture, engineering focus

---

### Popular Myths (Folk Beliefs)

**Basis**: Childish explanation (makes event comprehensible)
**Believers**: Children, uneducated, storytellers
**Function**: Simplifies complex event

---

#### Myth 2: The Last City

**Story**: One surface city survived, hidden somewhere
**Basis**: Hope (maybe not everyone died)
**Believers**: Romantics, optimists, treasure hunters

---

#### Myth 5: The Underground Was Always Home

**Story**: Humans evolved underground, surface was aberration
**Basis**: Comfort (this is natural, not exile)
**Believers**: Conservatives, those afraid of surface
**Function**: Justifies permanent underground existence

---

- Knowledge fragmented (specialists disagree)

**Major Questions**:
- Can the shift be reversed? (Unknown)
- Will it happen again? (Unknown)
- What was lost? (Mostly everything)
- What can be recovered? (Some technology, some knowledge)

---

### Surface Procurement Culture

**The Necessity**:
- Actinic goods required for underground survival
- Salts, resins, sterile materials
- Only produced by actinic exposure
- No alternative source

**The Danger**:
- Every run risks death
- Actinic exposure cumulative
- Surface predators evolved to hunt
- Equipment failures fatal

**The Economy**:
- High-risk, high-reward profession
- Guild control (monopolies)
- Free Crews (pirates)
- Massive inequality (those with access vs. those without)

**The Culture**:
- Runners as heroes (risk-takers)
- Runners as fools (unnecessary risk)
- Actinic scars as badges (proof of survival)
- Short lifespans (cumulative exposure)

---

### Psychological Impact

**Generational Trauma**:
- 10,000 years not enough to forget
- Stories passed down (horror of the Dying)
- Cultural memory (we survived but at cost)
- Fear encoded (surface = death)

**Sky Longing**:
- Some people dream of blue sky
- Yellow sun in visions
- Impossible nostalgia (no one alive remembers)
- Genetic memory? Cultural transmission? Something else?

**Surface Phobia**:
- Rational fear (surface will kill you)
- Irrational fear (even brief exposure terrifies)
- Some never go up (ever)
- Some can't function near surface access points

**The Unseeded Movement**:
- Scouring as proof Keelkin is trap
- "We survived Scouring without Keelkin" (disputed)
- "Keelkin partnership is Scouring inside us" (metaphor)
- Surface as symbol (freedom outside vs. prison inside)
