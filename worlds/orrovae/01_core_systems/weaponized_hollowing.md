## OVERVIEW

Natural Hollowing is a partnership failure that develops over months to years. **Weaponized Hollowing** is the deliberate acceleration of this process—forcing someone from Stage 1 (Partnership) to Stage 4 or 5 (Threshold/Hollowing) in weeks, days, or even hours.

This document details the methods, mechanics, and implications of induced Hollowing as used in the Maiming Wars.

## THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISM

### Why It Works

Natural Hollowing occurs when the balance between host and Säide tips too far toward the Säide. The host consciousness weakens, the Säide fills the vacuum. This can be accelerated by:

1. **Weakening the host** | Physical, psychological, or spiritual depletion
2. **Strengthening the Säide's need to act** | Forced healing cycles
3. **Breaking the Covenant** | Removing the boundaries that keep the Säide contained
4. **Amplifying resonance** | Overwhelming individual identity with collective

Weaponized Hollowing combines these factors deliberately.

## METHODS OF INDUCED HOLLOWING

### Method 1: Forced Optimization Cascade (FOC)

**Mechanism**: Repeatedly injure the target, forcing constant Säide healing. Each healing cycle requires the Säide to "take control" of body systems. Enough cycles, and it forgets to give control back.

**Process**:
1. Capture target
2. Inflict non-fatal wound
3. Wait for Säide to heal (Säide takes temporary control)
4. Immediately inflict new wound
5. Repeat until host consciousness cannot reassert
6. Typically: 20-50 cycles over 3-7 days

**Speed**: 3-14 days
**Detection**: Physical evidence (repetitive wound patterns, exhaustion markers)
**Countermeasures**: None once begun—Covenant cannot stop emergency healing

**Signature**: Victims show extreme drift, scarring in repetitive patterns, and often remain partially aware (watching from inside) for months.

**Who Uses It**: The Harvesters (create compliant Hollowed for labor/power extraction)

---

### Method 2: Covenant Nullification

**Mechanism**: Säide-Writs can modify Covenants. A malicious Writ can remove all boundaries, all consent requirements, all limits on Säide autonomy. Without Covenant restrictions, the Säide naturally expands.

**Process**:
1. Obtain access to target's Covenant (legal, forged, or forced)
2. File amendment removing key boundaries:
   - Consent requirements eliminated
   - Emergency override expanded to "any situation"
   - Autonomy limits removed
3. Target's Säide, now unrestricted, begins acting independently
4. Host consciousness erodes as Säide makes all decisions

**Speed**: 2-8 weeks (Säide has to "learn" new freedoms)
**Detection**: Covenant audit reveals tampering (if anyone checks)
**Countermeasures**: Covenant restoration (must be done before Stage 3)

**Signature**: Victims appear to Hollow "naturally" but show no risk factors. Covenant records reveal the truth.

**Who Uses It**: The Ledgers (bureaucratic assassination—victim dies with paperwork in order)

---

### Method 3: Resonance Immersion

**Mechanism**: Prolonged exposure to Säide-bearers, especially those already Hollowing, creates overwhelming resonance. Individual identity drowns in collective sensation.

**Process**:
1. Isolate target from unseeded contact
2. Surround with other Säide-bearers (ideally Stage 3-4 individuals)
3. Maximize physical proximity and emotional intensity
4. Target's sense of self blurs into group consciousness
5. Säide expands to fill the identity vacuum
6. Hollowing occurs as group phenomenon

**Speed**: 4-12 weeks
**Detection**: Difficult—resembles cult indoctrination
**Countermeasures**: Remove from resonance environment; force unseeded contact

**Signature**: Victims Hollow in groups, show synchronized behavior, may claim to "share consciousness."

**Who Uses It**: Certain Threadist cults; military units as accidental consequence

---

### Method 4: Psychological Collapse (Trauma Induction)

**Mechanism**: Extreme trauma causes host to "retreat" into the Säide for protection. The Säide, protecting the host, takes over. The host never comes back.

**Process**:
1. Subject target to severe trauma:
   - Torture (physical or psychological)
   - Forced witness to atrocity
   - Destruction of everything they love
   - Sexual violence
2. Host consciousness retreats from unbearable reality
3. Säide steps forward to handle trauma
4. Host finds Säide control more comfortable than awareness
5. Hollowing becomes escape from suffering

**Speed**: Days to weeks (depending on trauma severity and host resilience)
**Detection**: Physical evidence of trauma; psychological assessment
**Countermeasures**: Early psychological intervention (rarely available)

**Signature**: Victims often show calm, peaceful affect—disturbing contrast with trauma they endured. May express gratitude for Hollowing ("It's over now").

**Who Uses It**: Interrogators, slavers, enemies who want to destroy without killing

---

### Method 5: Chemical Acceleration (Experimental)

**Mechanism**: Certain compounds affect Säide activity. The Shapers have developed cocktails that enhance Säide metabolism while suppressing host neurological function.

**Process**:
1. Administer compound (injection, ingestion, or inhalation)
2. Säide activity increases 300-500%
3. Host neurological function decreases 40-60%
4. Imbalance tips rapidly toward Säide dominance
5. Hollowing occurs during period of chemical effect

**Speed**: Hours to days
**Detection**: Toxicology can identify compounds (if known)
**Countermeasures**: Antidote (if administered quickly); compounds still experimental

**Signature**: Rapid onset, often incomplete Hollowing (host still partially present but unable to act). Medical examination shows chemical markers.

**Who Uses It**: The Shapers (experimental); black market assassins (unreliable)

## DETECTION AND FORENSICS

### How Säide-Writs Identify Induced Hollowing

| Marker | Natural Hollowing | Induced Hollowing |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Timeline** | Months to years | Days to weeks |
| **Risk factors** | Present (starvation, trauma, overuse) | Often absent |
| **Wound patterns** | Random | Systematic (FOC method) |
| **Covenant status** | Intact but eroded | Modified or nullified |
| **Resonance history** | Normal | Abnormal exposure |
| **Chemical markers** | None | Possible |
| **Victim awareness** | Variable | Often high (watching from inside) |

### The Problem of Proof

**Legal Difficulty**: Proving someone *caused* Hollowing versus simply *witnessed* natural Hollowing is nearly impossible in many cases. This is why the Maiming Wars represent a doctrinal shift—when Hollowing becomes acceptable as political tool, the distinction stops mattering.

**The Ledgers' Advantage**: By keeping perfect records that show "natural" Hollowing, they make forensic investigation useless. "The paperwork is in order" becomes the defense.

## COUNTERMEASURES AND PREVENTION

### Pre-Attack Protection

| Countermeasure | Effectiveness | Availability |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Strong Covenant** | High (prevents nullification) | Universal |
| **Covenant monitoring** | Medium (catches tampering) | Expensive |
| **Unseeded companions** | High (grounds identity) | Rare/stigmatized |
| **Resonance limits** | Medium (prevents immersion) | Self-discipline |
| **Combat training** | Low (can't prevent capture) | Common |

### Post-Attack Intervention

| Stage | Intervention Success | Method |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Stage 1-2 | 70-80% | Covenant reinforcement, therapy |
| Stage 3 | 20-40% | Intensive intervention, possible |
| Stage 4 | 5-10% | Experimental only |
| Stage 5 | 0% | Irreversible |

**Critical Window**: Once Forced Optimization Cascade begins, intervention must occur within the first 24-48 hours. After that, each cycle makes reversal less likely.

## THE FIRST WEAPONIZED HOLLOWING

### The Spark That Lit the War

**Date**: Approximately 14 months before Book 1 begins
**Target**: Councillor Mira Vessberg, reform advocate
**Method**: Covenant Nullification + Psychological Trauma
**Perpetrators**: Unknown (suspected Unmaimed operatives)

**What Happened**:
Councillor Vessberg was a popular voice for Hollowing rights—protections for the Hollowed, investigation into exploitation. She was found at her desk, fully Hollowed, still signing documents. Her Säide continued her work for three days before anyone realized.

**The Investigation**:
- Covenant audit revealed amendments filed six weeks prior
- Amendments removed consent requirements, expanded autonomy
- Filing traced to legitimate Writ channels (Ledger involvement suspected)
- No criminal charges filed ("natural Hollowing, unfortunate timing")

**The Aftermath**:
Her political opponents claimed her Hollowing *proved* she lacked Fortitude for reform. "Even her own Säide knew her cause was weak." This framing launched the Unmaimed doctrine into political legitimacy.

## WEAPONIZED HOLLOWING IN THE WAR

### How Factions Use It

| Faction | Preferred Method | Target Type | Justification |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **The Unmaimed** | FOC, Psychological | Political enemies | "Revealing weak Patterns" |
| **The Harvesters** | FOC, Resonance | Anyone | "Community resource creation" |
| **The Ledgers** | Covenant Nullification | Inconvenient witnesses | "Administrative efficiency" |
| **The Shapers** | Chemical, FOC | Test subjects | "Research necessity" |
| **The Cullers** | Psychological, FOC | Tier-climbers | "Ambition culling" |

### The Escalation

**Year 1**: Political assassinations (targeted, deniable)
**Year 2**: Military application (capture and Hollow enemy soldiers)
**Year 3**: Mass Hollowing (entire communities targeted)
**Year 4**: Normalized (everyone does it, no one admits it)
**Year 5**: Collapse (society can't sustain the damage)

## SIGURD'S RESEARCH (Lane B Context)

### What Sigurd Discovers

Sigurd Aelfson's research into weaponized Hollowing reveals:

1. **The Pattern Connection**: Induced Hollowing damages Thread-Memory more severely than natural Hollowing. The violence of the induction corrupts the Pattern.

2. **The Counter-Agent Possibility**: Certain Covenant modifications can make a Säide "resistant" to external acceleration. Not prevention—just slowing.

3. **The Terrible Trade-Off**: The counter-agent works by making the Säide more attached to the current host, which increases dependency and risks *natural* Hollowing over time.

4. **The Range Discovery**: Some methods (resonance, chemical) can be administered without physical contact. Hollowing can be induced at *range*.

This last discovery is what makes Sigurd a target. The factions don't want defenses—they want weapons.

## STORY APPLICATIONS

### Book 1: The Vessberg Incident (Referenced)
The political assassination that starts it all. Helmar files reports about it. Sigurd examines the aftermath. Everyone knows it was murder; no one can prove it.

### Book 2: Mass Application
The Unmaimed begin openly Hollowing prisoners. Torven's company encounters a unit of Hollowed soldiers—former enemies, now weapons.

### Book 3: Sigurd's Fate
Sigurd's over-extension in developing countermeasures triggers his own Hollowing. The healer becomes the victim.

### Book 4: Kaisa's Threat
Kaisa is threatened with induced Hollowing as punishment for surface contact. She survives because her mixed-strain Säide resists acceleration.
