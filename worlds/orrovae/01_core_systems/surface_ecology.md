# SURFACE ECOLOGY

## Overview

The surface of Orrovae has been transformed by 10,000 years of actinic radiation and evolutionary pressure. This document catalogs the flora, fauna, ecosystems, and environmental hazards that surface runners encounter. All life here has adapted to conditions lethal to baseline biology - making the surface simultaneously alien and dangerous.

---

## ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES

### Fundamental Adaptations

**All surface life shares these characteristics**:

1. **Actinic Tolerance** (Various Mechanisms)
   - Reflective surfaces (carapaces, waxy coatings)
   - Photoreactive chemistry (uses actinic as energy source)
   - Rapid cell replacement (constant shedding)
   - Deep-tissue shielding (vital organs protected)
   - Dormancy cycling (inactive during peak actinic)

2. **Dark Coloration**
   - Black/deep purple/dark brown (not green)
   - Absorbs different light spectrum
   - Camouflage in shadow-heavy environment
   - Photosynthesis uses different chemistry

3. **Bioluminescence**
   - Common across species
   - Functions: Communication, hunting, defense, reproduction
   - Surface is darker than pre-Scouring (atmospheric changes)
   - Light production essential

4. **Rapid Lifecycle OR Extreme Longevity**
   - Fast reproducers: Breed before dying (weeks to months)
   - Slow agers: Survive indefinitely if conditions met (centuries)
   - No middle ground (moderate lifespan = extinction)

5. **Keelkin or Keelkin-Analog Symbiosis**
   - Most species have regenerative partnerships
   - Different strains (actinic-tolerant variants)
   - Creates regenerating predators and prey
   - Arms race of healing vs. damage

## SURFACE FLORA

### Overview

Plants on the surface use modified photosynthesis - not chlorophyll-based, but alternative chemistries that work with actinic-shifted spectrum.

---

### Category 1: SPORE-BLOOM FORESTS

**Appearance**:
- Tall stalks (3-8 meters high)
- Black trunks with purple-streaked bark
- No leaves (photosynthesis via bark surface)
- Crown of spore-producing structures (mushroom-like caps)

**Lifecycle**:
- Grows during lower-actinic seasons
- Releases spore clouds during peak actinic (summer)
- Dies back partially, regrows from underground rhizome
- Individual colony can be centuries old

**Ecology**:
- Creates "forests" of vertical stalks
- Spore clouds dangerous (respiratory hazard, some toxic)
- Provides shade (reduces actinic underneath by 30-40%)
- Attracts herbivores (spores nutritious despite danger)

**Human Interaction**:
- Harvesting spore-cap tissue (actinic goods - resins, membranes)
- Shelter use (shade during runs)
- Navigation landmarks (visible from distance)
- Hazard (spore inhalation, hidden predators)

**Notable Species**:

**Blackspire** (*Sporetallus magnus*):
- Tallest variety (up to 12 meters)
- Thick spore clouds (avoid during bloom)
- Valuable resin harvest
- Distribution: Temperate ruins

**Purpleweep** (*Sporetallus lacrima*):
- "Weeping" appearance (drooping caps)

- Reproduces via spores or fragmentation
- Extremely slow-growing (millimeters per year)

**Ecology**:
- Breaks down ruins (accelerates decay)
- Creates soil from stone (over centuries)
- Food source for specialized herbivores
- Creates "living stone" (organism or mineral? hard to tell)

**Human Interaction**:
- Harvesting (mineral-rich tissue for medicine, chemistry)
- Hazard (hidden - steps on what looks like stone, it bleeds)
- Ruin damage (accelerates structural collapse)
- Navigation confusion (landmarks change as growth spreads)

**Notable Species**:

**Ironvine** (*Lithophagus ferrum*):
- Iron-rich (body is magnetic)

- Food source (some edible, most toxic)
- Mycelium network = communication system? (disputed theory)

**Human Interaction**:
- Edible species harvested (rare food source)
- Toxic species avoided (hallucinations, death)
- Spores dangerous (respiratory hazard)

- Fire hazard (if dried out)

**Notable Species**:

**Shadowgrass** (*Gramen obscurus*):
- Pure black
- Dense coverage
- Slightly toxic (grazing animals adapted)
- Distribution: Open areas, old fields

**Razorblade** (*Gramen acutus*):
- Edges sharp (cuts exposed skin)
- Reflective coating
- Painful to move through
- Distribution: Areas with high wind

- Hallucinogenic (certain species cause visions, disorientation)

**Occurrence**:
- Seasonal (summer blooms most intense)
- Time of day (dawn/dusk - low actinic, high spore release)

---

## SEASONAL VARIATIONS

### Spring (Low Actinic, Mild)

**Actinic**: 0.7-0.9 Scour average
**Flora**: Spore-forests growing, fungi emerging, mineral-plants active
**Fauna**: Breeding season (most species), migrations begin, predators well-fed (abundant prey)
**Hazards**: Spore clouds increasing, territorial aggression (nesting), unstable weather

**Runner Strategy**: Good season (moderate actinic, predictable behavior)

---

### Summer (High Actinic, Harsh)

**Actinic**: 1.2-1.5 Scour average, peaks to 2-3 Scour
**Flora**: Spore-bloom (massive spore release), fungi dormant (too bright), grasses dying back
**Fauna**: Diurnal predators dominant (Gleaners, Razorwings), nocturnal species hiding, herbivores stressed (limited food)
**Hazards**: Extreme actinic (short safe times), spore clouds peak, storms, heat stress

**Runner Strategy**: Avoid if possible (most dangerous season), night-only operations

---

### Fall (Moderate Actinic, Comfortable)

**Actinic**: 0.8-1.0 Scour average
**Flora**: Spore-forests harvest energy, fungi re-emerging, new growth
**Fauna**: Feeding frenzy (preparing for winter), migrations, predators aggressive (stocking up)
**Hazards**: Hunting pressure high, territorial conflicts, weather turning

**Runner Strategy**: Best season (balanced actinic, good visibility, active economy)

---

### Winter (Low Actinic, Cold)

**Actinic**: 0.5-0.7 Scour average
**Flora**: Spore-forests dormant, fungi abundant (low actinic), mineral-plants slow
**Fauna**: Many species dormant/torpid, reduced predator activity, scavengers active (feeding on those who died)
**Hazards**: Cold (hypothermia), reduced food (prey scarce), storms, ice

**Runner Strategy**: Long work times (low actinic), but logistical challenges (cold, storms)

17-18: Dead zone (high actinic)
19: Gleaner nest (very dangerous, but valuable artifacts?)
20: Pre-Scouring artifact (intact technology?)

### Open Ground (d20)

1-4: Stonegrazer herd (harmless, but attracts predators)
5-7: Sporeeater flock (harmless, warning sign)
8-10: Razorwing overhead (spotting roll to notice)
11-12: Runner pack (distant, may approach)
13-14: Spore cloud (visibility/respiratory hazard)
15-16: Dead zone (actinic spike)
17-18: Surface storm approaching (time to seek shelter)
19: Gloomstrider (camouflaged, ambush)
20: Ancient stonegrazer (centuries old, massive, territorial)

---

### Spore-Forest (d20)

1-3: Surface fungi (dense growth, spores)
4-6: Sporeeaters (feeding, skittish)
7-9: Ashcrawlers (everywhere, feeding on fungi)
10-12: Gloomstrider (waiting in ambush)
13-14: Toxic spore cloud (hallucinogenic)
15-16: Valuable resin harvest (spore-bloom sap)
17-18: Gleaner scouts (hunting in shade)
19: Whisperling swarm (migrating through)
20: Massive spore-bloom (landmark, territory center)

## APPENDIX: CREATURE QUICK REFERENCE

### Threat Level Guide

**Threat 1** (Nuisance): Ashcrawlers
**Threat 2** (Avoidable): Sporeeaters, Stonegrazers
**Threat 3** (Dangerous): Whisperlings, Bonepickers
**Threat 4** (Deadly): Razorwings, Runners, Gloomstriders
**Threat 5** (Extreme): Gleaners, Rooters

### Size Comparison

**Small** (< 1m): Ashcrawlers, Whisperlings
**Medium** (1-2m): Sporeeaters, Bonepickers, Gleaners
**Large** (2-4m): Razorwings, Runners, Stonegrazers
**Huge** (4m+): Gloomstriders, Ancient Stonegrazers

### Actinic Tolerance

**High** (active during peak): Gleaners, Razorwings, Stonegrazers
**Moderate** (active dawn/dusk): Sporeeaters, most species
**Low** (nocturnal only): Rooters, Gloomstriders, Ashcrawlers

### Intelligence Ranking

1. Gleaners (possibly sapient)
2. Rooters (complex engineering)
3. Razorwings (strategic hunting)
4. Gloomstriders (patient ambush)
5. Whisperlings (swarm intelligence)
6. Others (instinctive)
