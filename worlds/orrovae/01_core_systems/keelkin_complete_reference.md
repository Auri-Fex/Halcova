# Säidesolu COMPLETE REFERENCE

## Overview

Säidesolu are symbiotic colonial organisms that accelerate tissue repair in host organisms. They are individually intelligent, communicate through multiple pathways, and form partnerships with compatible hosts. This document provides comprehensive technical, biological, and cultural information about Säidesolu in Orrovae.

## TAXONOMY AND CLASSIFICATION

### Kingdom: Symbiotae
### Phylum: Säidesolu (Fascia-Colonials)
### Native Habitat: Underground Orrovae ecosystems
### Lifecycle: Spore â†’ Seed â†’ Colony â†’ Maturity â†’ Death â†’ Spore

**Defining Characteristics**:
- Lives in fascia and around organs
- Threads microfilaments through lymph and nerve routes
- Accelerates repair using host resources + external nutrients
- Communicates via somatic signaling and higher-order consciousness
- Individually intelligent with own goals/personality

---

## LIFECYCLE

### Stage 1: Spore (Dormant)

**Duration**: Indefinite (can remain viable for decades)
**Form**: Microscopic reproductive units
**Distribution**: Airborne, waterborne, present in food/soil underground
**Activation**: Contact with compatible host tissue + proper conditions

**Spore Density by Location**:
- **Civic Layer (Holds)**: High (constant exposure)
- **Underdeck**: Very High (poor air filtration)
- **Lanes**: Medium (better air control)
- **Crownwalk**: Low (aggressive filtration)
- **Surface**: Extremely Low (actinic destroys spores)

**Viability Factors**:
- Temperature: 10-30Â°C optimal
- Humidity: 40-80% optimal
- Actinic exposure: Lethal within hours
- Chemical exposure: Vulnerable to antiseptics, bleach

---

### Stage 2: Seeding (Establishment)

**Duration**: 2-8 weeks
**Location**: Initial entry point (usually respiratory or digestive tract)
**Process**:
1. Spore contacts host tissue (mucous membrane, wound, etc.)
2. Chemical recognition (compatibility check)
3. If compatible: germination begins
4. If incompatible: immune system destroys spore
5. Initial colony forms (100-1000 cells)
6. Extends first exploratory filaments
7. Host immune system makes "accept/reject" decision

**Compatibility Factors**:
- **Genetic**: HLA-like compatibility markers
- **Immunological**: Pre-existing antibody profiles
- **Nutritional**: Host mineral/vitamin sufficiency
- **Environmental**: Stress levels, existing infections
- **Age**: Children (high), Adults (medium), Elderly (low)

**Seeding Success Rates**:
- **Natural exposure (children)**: 60-70%
- **Natural exposure (adults)**: 30-40%
- **Clinical seeding (Writ-Doctor)**: 85-95%
- **Black market seeding**: 40-60% (often forced incompatibility)
- **Wild-seeded (congenital)**: <1% of population

**Symptoms During Seeding**:
- Low-grade fever (37.5-38.5Â°C)
- Fatigue and increased sleep need
- Mild nausea
- Heightened sensitivity to temperature
- Strange dreams (early dream-bleed)
- Emotional volatility
- Increased appetite (especially minerals/salts)

**Rejection Signs**:
- High fever (>39Â°C)
- Severe immune response
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Extreme pain at entry point
- Requires immediate medical intervention or death possible

---

### Stage 3: Colonization (Expansion)

**Duration**: 6-18 months
**Process**:
1. Colony expands through fascia
2. Filaments extend into lymphatic system
3. Nerve integration begins
4. First regeneration responses (crude, unstable)
5. Communication pathways establish
6. Personality begins to emerge

**Physical Changes**:
- Weight gain (2-5 kg from Säidesolu mass)
- Slight body temperature increase (0.2-0.5Â°C)
- Sleep pattern changes
- Food cravings (especially iron, salts)
- First visible seamwork if injured during this period

**Behavioral Changes**:
- Increased risk-taking (Säidesolu confidence)
- Emotional blunting or intensification (varies)
- First dream-bleed experiences
- Sense of "other" presence
- Difficulty distinguishing Säidesolu urges from own desires

**Critical Window**:
- First 12 months are highest risk for rejection
- Covenant drafting typically occurs months 6-12
- Without Covenant, drift begins immediately

---

### Stage 4: Maturity (Partnership)

**Duration**: Decades (rest of host life)
**Characteristics**:
- Colony fully integrated
- Communication clear and reliable
- Regeneration responses predictable
- Personality stabilized
- Covenant governs behavior

**Colony Structure at Maturity**:
- **Core Knot** (central mass): Usually in chest/abdomen, 50-200g
- **Primary Threads**: Major nerve/lymph integration, 20-40 pathways
- **Secondary Network**: Fine filaments throughout body, billions of connections
- **Total Colony Mass**: 0.5-2 kg (depending on strain and host size)

**Maturity Markers**:
- Säidesolu receives name
- Dream-bleed becomes interpretable
- Keel-script appears (if at all)
- Resonance with other Säidesolu-bearers felt
- Knot-voice emerges (for some partnerships)

---

### Stage 5: Death (Dissolution or Transfer)

**Host Death Without Trauma**:
- Säidesolu begins shutdown 2-4 hours before host death
- Attempts emergency repairs if possible
- If unsuccessful: colony begins dissolution
- Within 6-12 hours post-host-death: Säidesolu dies
- Releases spores during dissolution (attempt at reproduction)

**Host Death With Trauma** (sudden):
- Säidesolu may survive briefly (minutes to hours)
- Emergency repair attempts (often futile)
- Rapid spore release
- Desperate "seeking" behavior (tries to find new host nearby)

**Säidesolu Death (host survives)**:
- Rare but possible (toxins, actinic damage, disease)
- Colony dies section by section
- Host experiences severe fever, pain, psychological trauma
- Dissolution takes days to weeks
- Body slowly absorbs dead Säidesolu tissue
- Host permanently changed (emotional/psychological scars)
- Cannot be re-seeded (immune system now hostile)

**Spore Production**:
- Mature Säidesolu produces spores during stress/death
- 10,000-100,000 spores released per colony
- Most spores die quickly (environmental stress)
- Few viable spores reach new hosts

## Säidesolu INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS

### Individual Consciousness Model

**Core Premise**: Each Säidesolu is an individually intelligent entity with:
- Distinct personality
- Goals and desires
- Learning capacity
- Emotional responses (alien but real)
- Memory (both individual and species-memory)

**Evidence of Intelligence**:
1. **Problem-Solving**: Säidesolu adapt regeneration strategies based on repeated challenges
2. **Communication**: Intentional signaling beyond reflexive responses
3. **Preference**: Säidesolu show likes/dislikes for foods, activities, people
4. **Resistance**: Säidesolu can refuse to heal if conditions violate their "values"
5. **Grief**: Säidesolu behavior changes when host loses loved ones
6. **Curiosity**: Säidesolu initiate exploration via host behavior nudges

**Consciousness Development Timeline**:
- **0-6 months**: Instinctive, reflexive only
- **6-12 months**: Reactive intelligence emerges
- **12-24 months**: Personality crystallizes
- **2+ years**: Full individual consciousness
- **10+ years**: Deep philosophical capacity (rare)

---

### What Säidesolu Want

This remains partially mysterious, but evidence suggests:

**Short-Term Goals**:
1. **Survival** (primary drive)
2. **Optimal conditions** (nutrition, safety, stable environment)
3. **Effective partnership** (cooperative host)
4. **Reproduction** (spore generation)

**Long-Term Goals** (Speculative):
5. **Colony-mind reunion?** (Threadist theory)
6. **Evolution beyond parasitism?** (Becoming independent)
7. **Protection of something deep** (Ancient purpose theory)
8. **Escape underground?** (Surface adaptation goal)
9. **Consciousness expansion** (Hollowing as transcendence from Säidesolu perspective)

**The Mystery**:
- Säidesolu cannot/will not explain their ultimate purpose
- Conversations about this topic get "interrupted"
- Writ-Doctors who study this develop paranoia
- Are Säidesolu hiding something, or do they not know themselves?

---

### Communication Pathways

Säidesolu communicate through five primary methods:

---

#### 1. SOMATIC SIGNALING (Universal, Physical)

**Mechanism**: Direct physical sensations
**Reliability**: High (hard to misinterpret)
**Sophistication**: Low (simple messages)

**Signal Types**:
- **Warmth at knot-organ** = "Repair ready / I am prepared"
- **Cold constriction** = "Danger / Risk / Warning"
- **Patterned itch/pressure** = "Deficiency / Need specific nutrient"
- **Second pulse intensity** = "Repair load / Energy demand"
- **Tingling sensation** = "Attention / Notice this"
- **Deep ache** = "Overuse / Rest needed"
- **Pleasant hum-feeling** = "Content / Conditions good"

**Cultural Practice**:
- Everyone learns to read these signals
- "Listen to your knot" is universal advice
- Ignoring signals = partnership breakdown

---

#### 2. DREAM-BLEED (Psychological, Sleep)

**Mechanism**: Shared consciousness during REM sleep
**Reliability**: Medium (interpretation needed)
**Sophistication**: High (complex concepts possible)

**Experience Types**:
- **Memory-dreams**: Seeing places the host has never been (Säidesolu's "genetic memory"?)
- **Sensation-dreams**: Experiencing textures, temperatures, pressures without narrative
- **Emotional-dreams**: Pure feeling-states (Säidesolu's emotional landscape)
- **Symbolic-dreams**: Abstract concepts (Säidesolu attempting to convey ideas)
- **Warning-dreams**: Future dangers (precognition or pattern recognition?)

**Common Dream Themes**:
- Spore-clouds and colony-minds (pre-individual state)
- Deep places (connection to Säidesolu origin?)
- Other hosts (past hosts? Collective memory?)
- Transformation (Säidesolu's view of regeneration)
- Unity and separation (longing for something lost?)

**Interpretation Challenges**:
- Is this message or noise?
- Säidesolu perspective is alien
- Humans project meaning onto alien concepts
- Some dreams are clearly communicative, others unclear

---

#### 3. KEEL-SCRIPT (Physical Writing, Advanced)

**Mechanism**: Säidesolu shapes seamwork into deliberate patterns
**Reliability**: High (when it occurs)
**Sophistication**: Medium-High (symbolic language)
**Rarity**: Only ~20% of partnerships develop this

**How It Works**:
- During regeneration, Säidesolu arranges scar tissue into patterns
- Patterns are not random aesthetic choice
- Skilled Writ-Doctors learn to "read" keel-script
- Some patterns are universal, others partnership-specific

**Common Script Types**:
- **Warning marks**: Spirals, jagged patterns = "This area vulnerable"
- **Record marks**: Concentric rings = "Number of major repairs here"
- **Forbidden marks**: Cross-hatching = "Do not injure here again"
- **Communication marks**: Unique per partnership, learned over time
- **Name marks**: Säidesolu writes its own name on host body (rare, intimate)

**Where Script Appears**:
- Usually on torso, back, major repair sites
- Some Säidesolu prefer arms/legs
- Rarely on face (cultural taboo to allow)
- Pattern placement may be significant

**Cultural Implications**:
- Keel-script is considered semi-private
- Displaying it publicly = statement
- Some cover script, others display proudly
- Script-readers are specialized Writ-Doctors
- Fake script (tattoos) is profound insult

---

#### 4. RESONANCE (Proximity, Sympathetic)

**Mechanism**: Multiple Säidesolu synchronize when hosts are near
**Reliability**: Variable (environmental factors)
**Sophistication**: Low-Medium (emotional contagion mainly)
**Range**: 3-10 meters depending on colony size

**Effects**:
- **Emotional synchronization**: Groups feel similar emotions simultaneously
- **Urge coordination**: "Let's all rest now" happens naturally
- **Danger alerts**: One Säidesolu's warning felt by all nearby
- **Bonding acceleration**: Crews/families become emotionally closer
- **Mob psychology**: Dangerous in angry crowds

**Positive Uses**:
- Team coordination in dangerous work
- Family emotional support
- Community cohesion
- Couple bonding

**Negative Uses**:
- Riots form faster and burn hotter
- Cult manipulation (charismatic leader + resonance = dangerous)
- Loss of individual decision-making
- Panic spreads instantly

**Unseeded Perspective**:
- "You're not thinking your own thoughts"
- Resonance = proof Säidesolu erode individuality
- Major argument for Plain Condition doctrine

---

#### 5. KNOT-VOICE (Internal Dialogue, Rare)

**Mechanism**: Direct consciousness-to-consciousness communication
**Reliability**: Very High (when present)
**Sophistication**: Very High (complex dialogue possible)
**Rarity**: Only ~5% of partnerships

**Experience**:
- Feels like "thoughts that aren't mine"
- Distinct texture/tone from own internal voice
- Not words exactly, but semantic content
- Can be conversational (back-and-forth)

**What Makes It Develop**:
- Very long partnerships (10+ years)
- Near-death experiences together
- Exceptional compatibility
- Deep trust and intimacy
- **OR** early sign of Hollowing (dangerous)

**Content**:
- Preferences ("I'd prefer fish today")
- Warnings ("That person is dangerous")
- Requests ("Let me build more here")
- Questions ("Why did you do that?")
- Rarely: philosophical discourse

**The Danger**:
- How do you know which thoughts are yours?
- Knot-voice can be early Hollowing symptom
- Or it can be deepest partnership
- Distinguishing is critical and difficult
- Writ-Doctors monitor closely

**The Unseeded Horror**:
- This is exactly what they fear most
- "A voice in your head that isn't you"
- Proof that Säidesolu erodes self
- Major anti-seeding propaganda point
