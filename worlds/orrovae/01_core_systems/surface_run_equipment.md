## OVERVIEW

Surface runners operate in one of the deadliest environments imaginable: actinic radiation that kills Säide colonies within hours, predators evolved for 10,000 years, and ruins that can collapse at any moment. This document details the equipment that keeps runners alive—and the failure modes that kill them.

**Core Philosophy**: Every piece of gear is chosen for reliability over performance. On the surface, equipment failure means death. Nothing is optional.

## THE STANDARD RUNNER KIT

### Tier 1: Survival Essentials (Non-Negotiable)

Without these, a runner dies. Period.

---

#### 1. ACTINIC SHROUD

**What It Is**: Full-body protective covering that blocks actinic radiation

**Construction**:
- **Outer Layer**: Treated spore-bloom membrane (dark, reflective)
- **Middle Layer**: Ash-compound paste on cloth substrate (absorbs radiation)
- **Inner Layer**: Soft fabric (comfort, sweat-wicking)
- **Total Weight**: 3-4 kg

**Coverage**:
- Head: Hood with integrated face-wrap
- Torso: Long coat or robe style
- Arms: Full coverage to fingertips (gloves attached or separate)
- Legs: Full coverage (pants or robe-skirt)
- Feet: Covered by separate boots (overlapping seal)

**Critical Points**:
- **Seams**: Double-stitched, treated with sealing paste
- **Closures**: Overlap design (no gaps when closed)
- **Hood/Face**: Tight seal around face, only eyes exposed
- **Wrists/Ankles**: Cinched tight, sealed with paste if needed

**Protection Rating**:
- New shroud: 90% actinic blocking (extends safe time from minutes to hours)
- Well-maintained: 80% blocking
- Worn (needs replacement): 60-70% blocking
- Damaged: Compromised (lethal)

**Lifespan**:
- Average: 15-25 surface runs
- Heavy use: 10-15 runs
- Careful use: 30+ runs
- **Must be inspected after every run**

**Cost**: 2-3 months of Midwork wages (significant investment)

**Maintenance**:
- Store in dark, dry conditions
- Patch holes immediately (patch kits carried)
- Re-treat with ash-compound every 5 runs
- Replace when blocking drops below 70%

---

#### 2. EYEPIECES

**What They Are**: Protective lenses that filter actinic while allowing vision

**Construction**:
- Boneglass lenses (actinic-filtering crystal)
- Leather or treated cloth frame
- Adjustable straps (secure fit essential)
- Side shields (blocks peripheral radiation)

**Lens Types**:

| Type | Visibility | Protection | Notes |
|------|------------|------------|-------|
| Clear Boneglass | 80% | 85% | Standard; vision slightly amber-tinted |
| Dark Boneglass | 50% | 95% | High-actinic work; limited visibility |
| Transition Boneglass | Variable | 90% | Expensive; adjusts to light level |

**Why Boneglass?**:
- Only material that filters actinic while transmitting useful light
- Cannot be synthesized underground (surface-harvested crystal)
- Extremely valuable (eyepieces often inherited)
- Scratches reduce effectiveness (careful handling essential)

**Cost**: 6+ months of Midwork wages (runner's most valuable possession)

**Maintenance**:
- Clean with soft cloth only
- Store in padded case
- Never touch lens surface
- Replace when visibility drops or scratches accumulate

---

#### 3. BREATHING PROTECTION

**What It Is**: Filtering apparatus for toxic air and spore hazards

**Types**:

**Basic Mouth Wrap**:
- Treated cloth over nose/mouth
- Filters large particulates, some spores
- Cheap, disposable
- Limited protection (30-60 minute effectiveness)

**Standard Filter Mask**:
- Leather mask with replaceable filter pads
- Blocks spores, some toxins
- Medium protection (2-4 hour effectiveness)
- Most common runner choice

**Full Canister System**:
- Face-sealing mask with attached filter canister
- Blocks nearly all airborne hazards
- Heavy, expensive, bulky
- Used for spore-forest work or toxic areas

**Filter Materials**:
- Charcoal (toxin absorption)
- Treated ash (spore catching)
- Moss-cloth (particulate filtering)
- Replaced after each run or when breathing becomes difficult

**Cost**: Basic wrap nearly free; full canister system = 1+ month wages

---

#### 4. BOOTS

**What They Are**: Protective footwear for surface terrain

**Requirements**:
- Thick soles (debris, sharp edges, thermal protection)
- High tops (ankle support, seamless connection to shroud)
- Reinforced toe (kick-testing debris, combat)
- Grip tread (unstable surfaces, climbing)
- Waterproof (pools, wet ruins)

**Materials**:
- Leather (most common, affordable)
- Treated leather (better durability)
- Boneglass-soled (rare, expensive, superior terrain protection)

**Common Failures**:
- Sole wear (lose grip, lose insulation)
- Seam splitting (actinic exposure to feet = crippling)
- Strap breakage (loose boot = twisted ankle = death)

**Cost**: 1-2 months wages for quality pair

**Lifespan**: 30-50 runs if maintained

---

### Tier 2: Essential Tools (Required for Function)

Without these, a runner can survive but cannot work effectively.

---

#### 5. TIMING DEVICE

**What It Is**: Mechanism for tracking surface exposure time

**Types**:

**Sand Timer** (Most Common):
- Glass ampule with calibrated sand
- Flipped at surface entry
- Visual and tactile feedback
- Cheap, reliable, no moving parts
- Carried on chest strap for constant visibility

**Water Clock** (Precision):
- Drip-based timing
- More accurate than sand
- Heavier, breakable
- Used by Guild operations

**Candle Timer** (Emergency):
- Marked candle burns at known rate
- Last resort (fire hazard, wind-sensitive)
- Always carried as backup

**Why Timing Matters**:
- Safe exposure varies by actinic level
- At 0.5 Scour: 60-90 minutes safe
- At 1.0 Scour: 20-30 minutes safe
- At 2.0 Scour: 5-10 minutes safe
- **Lose track of time = exceed safe exposure = Säide damage**

---

#### 6. ACTINIC METER

**What It Is**: Device measuring local actinic intensity

**Construction**:
- Boneglass chamber containing treated paper
- Paper darkens with actinic exposure
- Rate of darkening indicates intensity
- Calibrated scale for reading

**Use**:
- Check at entry point (baseline)
- Check when environment changes (moving to new area)
- Check if conditions feel wrong (atmospheric changes)
- Allows real-time exposure calculation

**Limitations**:
- Lag time (takes 30-60 seconds to show reading)
- Dead zones may not register properly
- Paper exhausted after 5-10 readings (replaced)

**Cost**: 2-3 weeks wages

---

#### 7. NAVIGATION KIT

**What It Is**: Tools for finding way on surface

**Contents**:

**Compass** (Magnetic):
- Underground: Unreliable (magnetic interference)
- Surface: Functional (open environment)
- Essential for crossing debris plains

**Landmark Cards**:
- Illustrated cards showing major surface features
- Passed between runners, updated regularly
- Each crew has their own set (proprietary knowledge)

**Route Threads**:
- Wax-coated string laid along path
- Retrieved on return (or left for others if needed)
- Prevents getting lost in complex ruins

**Signal Equipment**:
- Mirror (visual signaling to crew)
- Whistle (audio, short range)
- Smoke pellets (visual, alerts underground to position)
- Emergency flares (extreme, reveals position to everything)

---

#### 8. LIGHT SOURCES

**What It Is**: Illumination for underground sections and surface night work

**Types**:

**Glowstock** (Standard):
- Bioluminescent organism in sealed tube
- Shake to activate
- Lasts 4-8 hours
- Dim but reliable
- Cannot be extinguished quickly (tactical disadvantage)

**Oil Lamp** (Bright):
- Fuel-burning light
- Bright, controllable
- Fire hazard
- Fuel consumption (limited duration)

**Ember Box** (Emergency):
- Slow-burning compressed material
- Dim, long-lasting
- Cannot be used as primary light
- Backup for glowstock failure

**Surface Consideration**: Night runs avoid actinic but require light—which attracts predators. Trade-off always present.

---

### Tier 3: Professional Equipment (Efficiency Tools)

Serious runners carry these; casual runners skip some.

---

#### 9. SALVAGE TOOLS

**What They Carry**:
- Pry bar (accessing sealed containers)
- Knife (cutting, prying, combat)
- Rope (climbing, hauling, emergency)
- Sample bags (collecting small items)
- Carry frame (back-mounted, for larger salvage)

**Specialized by Target**:
- Boneglass harvest: Padded containers, extraction picks
- Resin collection: Heated knives, sealed jars
- Metal salvage: Cutting tools, detection rods
- Pre-Scouring artifacts: Preservation containers, cataloging supplies

---

#### 10. MEDICAL SUPPLIES

**Basic Kit**:
- Wound sealant (stops bleeding, protects from actinic)
- Burn treatment (actinic burns common)
- Stimulants (emergency energy, dangerous)
- Pain suppressants (function through injury)
- Anti-toxin (spore ingestion, animal venom)
- Splint materials (emergency bone stabilization)

**Not Carried**: Säide-assistance supplies (the whole point is your Säide keeps you alive; if it fails, you're dead anyway)

---

#### 11. RATIONS

**Surface Food**:
- High-calorie, compact (nuts, dried meat, pressed grain bars)
- Sealed packaging (no contamination)
- No cooking (fire = attention = death)
- Water: Carried in sealed containers, minimal (heavy)

**Duration**: Standard kit supports 4-6 hour operation

**Emergency Protocol**: If stranded, water is the crisis (dehydration kills faster than starvation)

---

### Tier 4: Emergency/Specialty Gear

Carried for specific situations or worst-case scenarios.

---

#### 12. SIGNAL ROCKETS

**What They Are**: Pyrotechnic devices for emergency signaling

**Use Cases**:
- Crew separation (rally point signal)
- Underground extraction request
- Distress (injured, stranded)
- Warning (predator concentration, hazard discovered)

**Danger**: Attracts every predator in visual range. Use only when situation already critical.

---

#### 13. EMERGENCY SHELTER

**What It Is**: Minimal protection for unexpected surface overnights

**Construction**:
- Reflective membrane (blocks some actinic)
- Collapsible frame
- Ground insulation
- Weight: 2-3 kg

**Protection**: Extends survival from hours to days—barely. Not a solution, just a delay.

**When Used**: Only when return to underground is impossible. Survival chance: 30-40% with shelter vs. ~5% without.

---

#### 14. WEAPONS

**Purpose**: Defense against surface predators and hostile humans

**Common Choices**:

**Crossbow** (Ranged):
- Quiet (doesn't attract additional predators)
- Bolt retrieval possible (ammunition conservation)
- Slow reload (one shot opportunity)
- Effective against small-medium predators

**Spear** (Versatile):
- Melee and throwing
- Probe function (testing ground, debris)
- Cannot be "run out"
- Effective against most threats if skilled

**Knife/Short Blade** (Last Resort):
- Always carried
- Close combat (bad situation already)
- Tool use (multi-purpose)
- Cheap, reliable

**Not Carried**: Heavy armor (too slow, actinic exposure increases with time), firearms (if they exist—too loud, ammunition too valuable)

## EQUIPMENT FAILURE MODES

### Shroud Failure

| Failure Mode | Cause | Time to Critical | Response |
|--------------|-------|------------------|----------|
| Tear (small) | Snagging, combat | 30-60 minutes | Patch immediately |
| Tear (large) | Major damage | 5-15 minutes | Abandon run |
| Seam opening | Wear, movement | 15-30 minutes | Seal with paste |
| Material degradation | Age, overuse | Gradual | Replace shroud |
| Wet shroud | Water exposure | Varies | Dry before actinic |

**Signs of Damage**:
- Unusual warmth on skin (radiation penetrating)
- Säide distress signals (warmth at knot-organ, then cold)
- Visual damage (obvious)
- Post-run symptoms (burns, fever)

---

### Eyepiece Failure

| Failure Mode | Cause | Effect | Response |
|--------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Lens crack | Impact | Vision compromised, protection reduced | Replace lens (spare carried) |
| Frame break | Stress, age | Cannot be worn securely | Emergency tie-off, abort run |
| Fogging | Temperature, sweat | Cannot see | Anti-fog treatment, brief removal (dangerous) |
| Loss | Combat, accident | No eye protection | Eyes closed, crew guidance, emergency return |

**Note**: Losing eyepieces on the surface is often fatal. Spare lenses are worth their weight in gold.

---

### Timing Failure

| Failure Mode | Cause | Effect | Response |
|--------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Sand timer break | Impact | No timing | Use backup, estimate, leave early |
| Timer buried/lost | Action | Cannot check time | Conservative estimate, leave early |
| Wrong calibration | Manufacturing error | Incorrect timing | Only discovered post-run (bad) |

**Emergency Protocol**: If unsure of time, leave immediately. Err toward early departure.

---

### Breathing Protection Failure

| Failure Mode | Cause | Effect | Response |
|--------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Filter saturation | Extended use | Reduced filtering | Replace filter (carry spares) |
| Mask breach | Damage, wear | Unfiltered air | Hold breath, seal breach, retreat |
| Strap failure | Stress, age | Mask falls off | Emergency hold, retreat |

**Spore Inhalation Symptoms** (Progression):
1. Coughing (minutes)
2. Difficulty breathing (15-30 minutes)
3. Hallucinations (30-60 minutes) — some species
4. Respiratory failure (1-4 hours) — some species

## CREW EQUIPMENT (SHARED)

Larger items carried by crew, not individuals:

**Communication**:
- Rope signals (tugs = codes)
- Mirror arrays (long-distance visual)
- Runner system (messenger to crew to underground)

**Heavy Salvage**:
- Cart/sled (drag large items)
- Lifting equipment (pulleys, ropes)
- Cutting tools (saws, wedges)

**Medical**:
- Stretcher (evacuate wounded)
- Extended medical supplies
- Emergency stimulants (get wounded back to gate)

**Emergency**:
- Shared shelter materials
- Emergency rations (extended stranding)
- Backup equipment (spare shrouds, filters, timing)

---

## EQUIPMENT ECONOMY

### Acquisition

**Guild Runners**:
- Equipment provided by Guild
- Maintained by Guild
- Must return equipment after runs
- Upgrades earned through performance

**Independent Runners** (Kaisa's crew):
- Purchase own equipment
- Maintain own gear
- Keep all salvage (minus gate taxes)
- Higher risk, higher potential reward

**Free Crews**:
- Scavenged, stolen, or traded equipment
- Variable quality
- No support structure
- Often dangerous gear conditions

### Costs (Midwork Wage Reference)

| Item | Cost | Lifespan |
|------|------|----------|
| Basic shroud | 2-3 months | 15-25 runs |
| Quality shroud | 4-6 months | 30-50 runs |
| Basic eyepieces | 3-4 months | Years (careful use) |
| Quality eyepieces | 6-12 months | Decades (heirloom) |
| Standard filter mask | 2-3 weeks | 20-30 runs (filters replaced) |
| Timing device | 2-4 weeks | Years (glass breakage) |
| Actinic meter | 2-3 weeks | Months (paper replacement) |
| Full kit (minimum) | 4-6 months | Variable |
| Professional kit | 8-12 months | Variable |

**Note**: This is why running is often generational. Equipment inheritance = career inheritance.
