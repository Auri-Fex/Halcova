# ORSEK CASEFILES — COLLECTION BIBLE v1.0

*(World-first anthology: Constructcraft + civic noir + horror escalation)*

## 1) What this book is

A  **collection of episodic short stories** . Each story is  **one complete case** . The only continuity that grows story-to-story is **small, outside-life character texture** (not plot arcs, not new world rules). The world, the system, and the horror are the stars.

**Core promise:** every case resolves to a **provable mechanism** (even if power tries to bury it).

---

## 2) The engine

### Quiet Blood (the civic noir method)

Violence is engineered to look like:

* tool failure
* contamination / counterfeit goods
* “weather,” “fatigue,” “mismanagement”
* riots that look like “the people”

Guilds and underwriters win by controlling  **work, tools, food, housing, protection** , and the narrative of blame.

### The horror layer (rare escalation)

Most cases are human Quiet Blood. Sometimes, someone pays for worse:

* **Akslur** (hostile behind-layer)
* **Vlokim** (curse condition; common speech says “curse”)
* **Kemhak** (planted anchor object)
* **Schim** / **Aapshim** (the monkey-like manifest seat-form)

**Hard rule:** if there’s Vlokim, there’s a Kemhak. If there’s a Kemhak, there was  **access** .

---

## 3) Setting constraints

* **Tech baseline:** 1860–1880 vibes. No electronics. No modern surveillance.
* **Everything is tactile:** tool marks, rivet stamps, oils, grit, knots, seams, custody bins.
* **Constructcraft reads as industrial arcana** , not superhero beams.

---

## 4) The two supernatural facts (tight, non-expanding)

### Usable human phenomenon: Constructcraft

Hard-light constructs produced via **lens-coins** etched with blueprint lattices and powered by  **biolight** .

Key sub-systems:

* **Calibration** (living signature keying)
* **Etch degradation** (wear ladder: Flicker → Drift → Bloom → Backscatter → Collapse)
* **Stored fuel:** **levpekel** (case-held biolight) that can **rot**
* **Parasitic leak:** cases can drain the carrier (seip → zuik → bit → crash)

### Hostile world phenomenon: Akslur (B-track)

Akslur can’t freely roam. It can only **seat briefly** under conditions:

* late-stage Vlokim (Attuning/Molting)
* Kemhak near enough to anchor
* low-coherence window (dark / smoke / fog / stale levpekel / heavy leak proximity)

**Schim** is the brief manipulator-form during Manifest — hands, leverage, sabotage.

---

## 5) Key in-world terms (locked)

* **Akslur** — hostile behind-layer
* **Vlokim** — curse condition (characters still say “cursed”)
* **Kemhak** — planted anchor object
* **Schim** — manifest seat-form (Orsek term)
* **Aapshim** — common/scared name for Schim

(Use code-switching for flavor: Orsek lean Strak; street uses English “curse” plus Aapshim folklore talk.)

---

## 6) Institutions that matter on-page (already in play)

* **Stravak** : state order control (cordons, crowd management, containment)
* **Orsek** : private investigators (causation, accountability, proof)
* **Underwriters / Borg pressure** : access, denial, liability smoothing
* **Custody / “safety doval”** : evidence laundering move
* **Pattern/etch ecosystem** : catalog control, counterfeits, wear-state fraud
* **Licensed crowd windows** (especially **Menvri** venues): power + panic + donor crash risk

---

## 7) The city map (use as rotating “episode stages”)

Districts you’re already using:

* **Hograd** (high quarter)
* **Marvel** (market ward)
* **Werslag** (works ring)
* **Havkad** (docks/canal; fog)
* **Menvri** (venues row; licensed windows; smoke)
* **Kwerf** (custody/quarantine yard; laundering)
* **Sporek** (rail gate/yards)
* **Kustra** (cold ward; scarcity)

**Akslur risk overlay:** Havkad, Kustra, Kwerf, Menvri naturally produce low-coherence windows.

---

## 8) Series format rules (so stories “rock”)

### Case template (every episode)

1. Hook incident (body/failure in a vivid place)
2. Ersles (first-read: material + body + custody reality)
3. Pressure spike (access denied / second incident / cover-up attempt)
4. Action beat (chase, raid, fight, convoy, rooftop, gate lane)
5. Mechanism reveal (how it was made to look like failure)
6. Receipts (the proof that survives laundering)
7. Button line (case won; incentives still rotten)

### Supernatural frequency rule

* **Majority** : human Quiet Blood only
* **Few** : Vlokim/Kemhak cases (rare, escalatory, memorable)
* **Schim** : mostly glimpses; clear sightings only in feature episodes

---

## 9) Word count targets (locked)

**Collection target:** ~**132k** total

* **8 standard cases:** ~**12k** each (10k–14k acceptable)
* **2 feature cases:** ~**18k** each (16k–20k acceptable)
  * Feature #1: first full Vlokim + clear Schim presence
  * Feature #2: swallowed Kemhak escalation

**Outside-life growth slice:** ~8–10% per story (600–1,200 words), texture-only.

---

## 10) POV strategy (world-first, locked)

* **7 stories:** single POV (default:  **Reklar** )
* **1 story:** single POV ( **Skerin** ) — materials/counterfeit/wear-state showcase
* **1 story:** single POV ( **Mildan** ) — leak/levpekel/body clock showcase
* **2 feature stories:** 2–3 POVs
  * Feature #1: Reklar + Skerin (and at most one brief support POV)
  * Feature #2 (swallowed Kemhak): Reklar + Mildan (+ at most one brief support POV if needed for cordon/custody reality)

POV is a camera. The camera serves the  **world rules and dread** , not ensemble bookkeeping.

---

## 11) Episode slate (working titles + what each showcases)

1. **Scaffold Slip** — Werslag; tool-failure murder; chase + standardized sabotage tells
2. **Cut Oil** — Marvel; contamination hit; supply route + residue logic
3. **Payroll Vanish** — Marvel→Werslag; riot pressure; Stravak cordon reality
4. **Impound Wrong** — Kwerf; custody laundering; “safety doval” as antagonist tool
5. **Cold Hem** *(Feature #1 recommended)* — Kustra/Havkad; first true Vlokim; Kemhak found; Schim moves the world
6. **Venue Window** — Menvri; licensed crowd window; panic + donor crash setpiece
7. **Chainmark** *(Skerin POV)* — Sporek/Werslag; counterfeit chain/bolt; wear-state and tool-mark truth
8. **House Fire That Isn’t** — Havkad; arson staged as accident; proof extraction under pressure
9. **Red Herring Curse** *(Mildan POV works well)* — everyone screams Vlokim; it’s human staging; reinforces Orsek discipline
10. **Swallowed Anchor** *(Feature #2)* — escalation: Kemhak internalized; medical clock + custody war + finite light defense

(These are casefile labels, not permanent “series lore.”)

## 12) How Schim horror plays without breaking noir

Schim is not a roaming monster. It is  **brief hands** :

* works latches/knots/seams
* nudges balance and friction
* biases constructs toward drift when already stressed

**Evidence matters:** cold prints, dust pivot arcs, condensation mismatches, micro-scrape patterns, repeating “grip bias.”

---

## 13) What we are *not* doing

* No freeform spellcasting, no “witch duels,” no expanding magic schools
* No constant monster-of-the-week
* No “it was supernatural, so proof doesn’t exist” endings
* No worldbible drift: each case showcases *existing* districts, systems, and incentives

---

## 14) Open dials (not locked yet; hold until needed)

* Schim visibility: glimpse-only vs occasional clear sighting outside features
* Manifest duration: seconds vs minutes
* Repel vs injure: whether coherent constructs can harm Schim or only drive it off
* Vlokim seeding difficulty: specialist rarity level
* Framing reliability: how reliably a Kemhak can be miskeyed to implicate someone else

---

### Next “ready to draft” deliverables

1. **Collection Outline v1.0** : one-page beat list per story (hook → action → receipts → button) tied to district + system showcase.
2. **Outside-Life Ledger v1.0** : a single line per story per POV-holder (one personal detail, no arc sprawl).

When you’re ready, I’ll produce both in the same format as above so you can move straight into drafting Story 1.
