## Reviewing: World Bible v1.0 (Constructcraft + Quiet Blood) • City Layer v0.1 • Institutional Web v0.1 • Orsek Crew v0.1 • Strak conlang pipeline + lexicon • B-Track supernatural patch (Akslur / Vlokim / Kemhak) + integration updates

# WORLD BIBLE v1.1 — Constructcraft + Quiet Blood + Akslur (B-Track)

A dark fantasy / neo-noir city where guilds fight economic wars through “accidents,” counterfeits, shortages, and crowd pressure — while investigators (Orsek) try to prove causes inside a system designed to smooth trouble away. The only usable human “magic” is Constructcraft (hard-light constructs). The only other supernatural phenomenon is hostile and deniable: Akslur intrusion, typically induced through Vlokim using a planted Kemhak.

---

## 0) One-line pitch

Hard-light constructs are produced by etched lens-coins and powered by biolight (often stored as levpekel). The city’s real war is bureaucratic and economic — violence disguised as failure. In the background, a hostile behind-layer (Akslur) can be carried in via curse-objects (Kemhak), turning “accidents” into something worse — while coherent light keeps it away only as long as the fuel and hardware hold.

---

## 1) The two supernatural facts (tight, non-expanding)

### 1.1 Usable human phenomenon: Constructcraft

The ability to instantiate **hard-light constructs** (solid, load-bearing photonic lattices) using:

* **Biolight fuel** (live draw or stored fuel)
* **Etched hardware** (lens-coins / substrate patterns)
* **Calibration and wear limits** (keying + degradation)

### 1.2 Hostile world phenomenon: Akslur (B-Track)

**Akslur** is a hostile “behind-layer” that can **briefly seat** into physical space under low-coherence conditions. Humans do not “cast” Akslur. Humans can, however, induce and weaponize its contact through **Vlokim** (curse condition), typically anchored by a **Kemhak** (planted fetish object).

**Common speech** calls Vlokim “a curse.” In-world, they code-switch.

---

## 2) Constructcraft system (core)

### 2.1 Biolight fuel

Biolight is extracted from living metabolic processes and converted into coherent structure.

**Fuel qualities**

* **Output:** how much construct exists at once
* **Sustain:** how long it holds
* **Coherence:** precision/rigidity/sharpness

**Fuel sourcing modes**

* **Self-fuel** (safer, limited, tragic)
* **Touch-fuel** (predatory, requires contact/near contact)
* **Crowd-fuel** (industrial/systemic; legal only in licensed windows)

### 2.2 Stored biolight: levpekel (fuel-in-a-case)

Biolight can be stored in a **lens case** as stabilized fuel (levpekel). This enables pre-loaded use without needing real-time harvesting during every action.

**Core consequences**

* Storage is never perfect: levpekel **rots** (loss of Cut/coherence) and can become unstable.
* Storage creates a new horror:  **parasitic leak** .

### 2.3 Parasitic leak (case leak)

A leaking case doesn’t “hurt someone nearby” like radiation. It **consumes the carrier’s biolight** to maintain its own stability. In effect, the case becomes hungry.

**Leak severity ladder (operational, readable in scenes)**

1. **Seip** — chill, fatigue, low heat; “bad weather” plausible
2. **Zuik** — tremor + nausea + focus slips; recovery is slow; worsens near the case
3. **Bit** — sharp drain episodes (fainting, arrhythmia risk, vision artifacts); high danger under stress
4. **Crash** — sustained drain; cannot safely carry or operate constructs; collapse risk spikes

(These are physiological tells, not mysticism.)

---

## 3) Lens-coins (form + interface)

A lens-coin is a palm-sized photonic circuit defining:

* **what can be made** (pattern library)
* **how stable** it is (resolution)
* **how it fails** (wear profile)

**Anatomy**

* **Ring (metal):** phase stability + signature retention
* **Core (saintglass / opalized resin):** etch substrate
* **Etches:** blueprint lattices
* **Key layer:** calibration imprint (living signature coupling)
* **Wear state:** cumulative damage from use

### 3.1 Blueprint carriers (what can hold patterns)

Blueprints can be etched/embedded into  **purpose-built substrates** , not “anything.” Canon carriers include:

* **Lens-coin cores** (primary pattern store)
* **Host plates / inserts** (swap-in etched plates for specific constructs)
* **Case-liners** (safe patterns, stabilizers, or controlled-release shapes)
* **Tool-mount guides** (simple utility forms: clamps, wedges, lock guides)
* **Structural tiles/plates** used in public works (authorized, limited catalogs)

(Constraint stays: no freeform “anything.” It’s a library, not imagination magic.)

---

## 4) Core rules (A + B) + Proof Scars

### Rule A: Living Calibration (personal keying)

Coins are calibrated to a living physiological signature (pulse rhythm, breath cadence, micro-tremor profile, heat-map distribution). Not thoughts, not emotion.

**Non-keyed use** is possible but degraded:

* weaker output, unstable coherence
* higher failure risk
* greater fuel drain

### Rule B: Etches degrade (entropy smear)

Every activation damages the lattice.

**Degradation ladder**

1. Flicker
2. Drift
3. Razor Bloom
4. Backscatter
5. Lattice Collapse

### Proof Scars (security layer)

An elite upgrade (biometric second factor) that makes theft insufficient. Coins can require:

1. coin integrity
2. living calibration
3. proof scar match

Failure often produces refusal or “dirty burn” (higher bloom/backscatter likelihood).

---

## 5) 1860–1880 tech baseline (how it sits differently)

This world’s “modernity” is  **in materials and institutions** , not electronics.

* Logistics: wagons, rail yards, docks, cranes, scaffolds — sabotage has physical plausibility.
* Communication: messengers, postings, lantern codes, word-of-mouth cascades.
* Forensics: tool marks, rivet stamps, oil cuts, grit in flour, stress halos in substrates — procedural, tactile.
* Medicine: symptom timing and exposure effects are interpreted through period-credible practice (no scanners), making Mildan-style field medicine powerful and grounded.

Net effect: Constructcraft feels like  **industrial arcana** , not “superhero beams.”

---

## 6) Akslur layer (B-Track) — integrated, not spellcasting

### 6.1 Definitions (locked)

* **Akslur:** the hostile behind-layer (formerly “the veil”)
* **Vlokim:** the curse condition (common speech still says “curse”)
* **Kemhak:** the planted fetish/anchor object

### 6.2 What Vlokim is (Proposal B)

Vlokim is not a bolt of magic. It is  **seeded infestation** :

* A **Kemhak** is built using sympathetic tag (hair/sweat cloth/thread) and a carrier medium.
* The Kemhak **feeds** on biolight slowly over time.
* As it attunes, it creates **local coherence failure** around the target — turning small errors into consistent failures.

### 6.3 Lifecycle ladder (Aliens spine)

0. **Planted** — no symptoms, only access crime
1. **Feeding** — subtle drain + mild bad luck
2. **Attuning** — failures become consistent and target-linked
3. **Molting** — one sharp escalation event (danger spike)
4. **Manifest** — brief seating in low-coherence conditions (dark/smoke/fog/stale levpekel/leak-heavy proximity)

### 6.4 Why light repels it (and why light still runs out)

Coherent hard-light lattices act as a hostile boundary: Akslur seating collapses under coherence.
Defense remains finite because:

* fuel is finite (and stored fuel rots)
* coins degrade
* leak states worsen under stress

Akslur doesn’t replace your failure mechanics; it **biases** them toward catastrophe at the worst moments.

## 7) The city (City Layer v0.1, locked)

**Districts (Charter → street):**

* **Hograad → Hograd** (high quarter)
* **Markveld → Marvel** (market ward)
* **Werkslag → Werslag** (works ring)
* **Havkade → Havkad** (docks/canal)
* **Mengvenst-Rij → Menvri** (licensed venues row)
* **Kwarwerf → Kwerf** (quarantine/custody yard)
* **Sporhek → Sporek** (rail gate/yards)
* **Koudstraat → Kustra** (cold ward)

### Licensed crowd windows (power tides)

Crowd-fuel is legal only inside licensed windows:

* **Stage Window** (venues on Menvri)
* **Works Window** (limited public works draw at shift edges, rare)
* **Festival Window** (largest, highest-risk nights)

### Akslur risk map overlay (no new places, just usage)

Higher likelihood of Vlokim progression / Manifest conditions:

* **Havkad** (fog/cold/water)
* **Kustra** (low heat)
* **Kwerf** (storage + laundering opportunity)
* **Menvri** (smoke/crowds/windows)

---

## 8) Institutional web (v0.1, locked)

### Guild/trade blocks (7)

* **Kraenbond → Kran** (rig & lift)
* **Ketwerk → Ket** (chain & bolt)
* **Sainthuis → Saint** (glasswrights)
* **Opalwerf → Opal** (resin growers)
* **Brugraad → Brug** (public works wardens)
* **Venraad → Ven** (licensed venues consortium)
* **Sporbond → Spor** (carters & rail union)

### Underwriters (3)

* **Huis Borg → Borguis** (access product)
* **Huis Zegel → Zel** (custody legitimacy)
* **Huis Begro → Bro** (budgets / “public safety contracts”)

### Pattern libraries

* **Etsraad (Ets)** — conservative catalogs
* **Lenshof (Lhof)** — elite custom work
* **Rotsnede (Rot)** — illicit copy mill

### Calibration clinics

* **Stemhuis (Stem)** — legitimate network
* Black-market “back-stem rooms” exist (unnamed; no new naming added)

### Custody sites

* **Kwarf** (main yard)
* **Kwartor → Ktor** (overflow tower)

---

## 9) Law & Order operating model (as used in-story)

* **Stravak** : state-owned order control — cordons, crowd management, immediate containment.
* **Orsek** : private investigators — hired and funded through borg/surety channels; they pursue causation and accountability and constantly collide with convenience, liability, and cover-ups.

(Procedural conflict is the engine: the watch can stop chaos; Orsek try to stop the lie.)

---

## 10) Orsek crew (names locked) + POV roles

* **Reklar** — lead; sequence, motive-pressure, narrative control of the case
* **Skerin** — etch/host specialist; material truth, counterfeit tells, wear-state reading
* **Mildan** — body/physiology; leak timing, donor crash, backscatter-like effects
* **Kostek** — borg/access wrangler; terms, denial, leverage, entry rights
* **Ruvak** — Stravak liaison; cordon reality, custody friction, crowd temperature
* **Bradu** — field runner; chokepoints, retrievals, tails, “what disappears next”

### Orsek procedural update (integration requirement)

Add an internal protocol flag to ersles (first-read):
**“Kemhak suspected”** triggers:

* targeted anchor search (case seams, coat hems, bedding, tool rolls, lockers)
* no bare-hand handling of candidate objects
* symptom timing interview bundle (Mildan)
* stored-fuel rot check in relevant rooms/containers (Skerin + Mildan)
* custody hardening to prevent “safety doval” destruction (Ruvak + Kostek)

---

## 11) Quiet Blood series engine (story spine)

“Quiet Blood” is the method of killing and control:

* tool-failure murders
* contamination hits
* street pressure events
* respectable distance through contractors

**Season arc (5 books) remains:**

1. strike pattern → enforcer school signature
2. counterfeit “peace” → trust capture via inspectors
3. wage riot → private enforcement arm
4. charterless → fugitive proof + governance exposure
5. subscription crown → least-worst governance fight

### New integration: Vlokim-as-a-service (bounded)

Vlokim is a premium tactic within Quiet Blood:

* requires access (plant Kemhak)
* requires time (lifecycle)
* requires feed (biolight trickle)
* remains deniable (looks like failure/weakness/weather)

---

## 12) Open dials (status)

### Constructcraft dials (locked from prior “do it”)

* Lens-coins: regulated but present enough to matter (black market exists)
* Crowd-fuel: legal only inside licensed windows (Menvri + rare public works + festivals)
* Proof scars: elite-leaning practice (not universal)
* Re-keying: possible but expensive and ethically rotten in black markets
* Degradation: meaningful per job; extended fights burn tools

### Akslur/Vlokim dials (not locked yet)

* Manifest duration (seconds vs minutes)
* Whether coherent constructs repel only vs can injure
* Seeding difficulty (specialists vs broader craft)
* Attune speed (days vs weeks)
* Framing reliability (miskeying a Kemhak to blame someone else)

---

## 13) Strak conlang pipeline (repeatable, practical)

**Baseline root language:** Dutch (as raw material), then “molted” into Strak.

**Core transforms**

* sch → **sk**
* ch → **k**
* aa/oo/ee → **a/o/e**
* ij → **i**
* drop weak endings like **-en** in street speech
* clip Charter compounds into 4–7 letter street forms
* prefer hard consonants and tight vowels for street words

**Code-switching rule**

* Charter/legal speech uses longer compounds.
* Street speech uses molted forms.
* Characters mix English translations (“curse”) with Strak terms (Vlokim) naturally.

**Locked Strak supernatural terms**

* **Akslur** (behind-layer)
* **Vlokim** (curse condition)
* **Kemhak** (planted fetish/anchor object)

---

## 14) Quick glossary (project use)

* **Constructcraft** : hard-light constructs via lens-coins + biolight
* **Lens-coin** : etched photonic tool (pattern library)
* **Levpekel** : stored biolight fuel (case-held), rots over time
* **Leak** : parasitic drain from storage/kit on the carrier
* **Proof scars** : biometric second factor for coins
* **Stravak** : state order control
* **Orsek** : private investigators
* **Borg** : surety/access leverage
* **Slag** : custody/impound evidence state
* **Akslur** : hostile behind-layer
* **Vlokim** : curse condition (common speech: “curse”)
* **Kemhak** : planted fetish/anchor object enabling Vlokim

---

If you want the next “make it writeable” step, the two highest-value inserts are:

1. **Akslur Appendix v0.2** (expanded tells + containment + rarity rules)
2. **Orsek Protocol Addendum (Kemhak Suspected) — one-page** (scene procedure you can reuse every case)
