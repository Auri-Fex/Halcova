## Reviewing: World Bible v1.1 (locked) • Akslur/Vlokim/Kemhak (locked) • New approval: **Schim / Aapshim** as the Manifest seat-form

Perfect. This gives you the **Aliens** dread you want: “someone put a thing on me, and now something with *hands* comes out of the dark to work the world against me.”

### Locked terminology (additive)

* **Schim** = the **Manifest seat-form** (the “handler” that can physically meddle)
* **Aapshim** = the longer/common-folkloric name people use when they’re scared or superstitious
  * Orsek will usually say **Schim** (short, clinical)
  * Street talk says **Aapshim** (“monkey-shadow” vibe)

Below is the **project-ready insert** that updates the Akslur layer without turning it into generic monster fantasy.

# WORLD BIBLE PATCH — Schim / Aapshim (Manifest Creature)

## What it is

A **Schim** is the brief, partially-physical form Akslur takes during **Manifest** — not a “native animal,” not a demon, not a free-roaming monster.

It appears because:

* the target is in **late Vlokim** (Attuning/Molting),
* a **Kemhak** is near enough to act as an anchor,
* and the environment is **low-coherence** (dark/smoke/fog/stale levpekel/heavy leak).

**Functionally:** it is the **hands** of the curse.

## Why it looks monkey-like

Because it’s built to do  **small mechanical sabotage** , fast:

* latches, knots, seams
* pockets, tool rolls, chain links
* small shifts of friction and balance
* quick tugs that convert “safe” into “fall”

That shape isn’t folklore — it’s efficiency.

## What it can do (hard limits, noir-safe)

A Schim can reliably do only  *cheap, physical things* :

* **Unseat** a latch that was “fine”
* **Work a knot under load** so it slips (not neatly untie)
* **Tug / bump / nudge** a limb or tool at the worst second
* **Change friction** in a hand-span area (slick/drag)
* **Interfere with coherence locally** , pushing constructs into **drift** or **softening** when the coin is already stressed

## What it cannot do

This is how you avoid “bad luck magnets” and keep the rules sharp:

* It cannot roam freely or hunt citywide.
* It cannot sustain itself in coherent hard-light.
* It cannot act for long — it’s a  **short window** , not a new ecology running loose.
* It cannot do impossible strength feats; it wins through timing and leverage.

## Duration and behavior (recommended default)

To hit your horror goal **without** breaking noir plausibility:

* **Duration:** usually  **5–30 seconds** , rarely up to **2 minutes** in the worst low-coherence conditions.
* **Mind:** animal-cunning + tool instinct (curious, opportunistic, not chatty, not “smart villain”).
* **Visibility:** mostly  **glimpses** ; clear sightings are rare and traumatic.

This makes it terrifying and deniable: people can argue about what they saw, but the **receipts** don’t lie.

# Evidence it leaves (so Orsek can prove it)

A Schim must leave consistent “physical receipts,” or it becomes vibes. Use these:

1. **Cold prints on metal/glass** that bloom and fade (wrong-side condensation)
2. **Dust pivot arcs** near floorlines/shelves (crouch-turn traces)
3. **Micro-scrape marks** in wax/seal-paste (claw/edge bias)
4. **Grip bias** : repeat slip profile on the same latch/knot type across scenes
5. **Localized fogging** on the wrong side of glass (inside/outside mismatch)

These receipts become the forensic spine: “same interference signature, same anchor proximity, same low-coherence window.”

# How it plays as murder (minor → massive)

### Minor (foreshadowing)

A dim room. Kemhak in a coat hem.
Someone glimpses a small shape perched low. A latch clicks open. Cold print on brass.
**Result:** creepy, deniable, solvable.

### Injury (quiet escalation)

Fog alley. Molting-adjacent.
A sleeve tug at a curb. A wrist breaks. Everyone blames slick stone.
**Result:** “accident” with a repeating pattern.

### Lethal (Quiet Blood perfection)

Night scaffold, tar smoke, low lantern.
Schim seats for ten seconds, “works” a knot, and vanishes.
**Result:** dead worker, no obvious culprit, maximum deniability.

### Civic incident (big stakes without superhero chaos)

Menvri venue: smoke + crowd window + planted Kemhak in rigging.
Schim opens a flow gap by nudging a barrier into drift; panic + donor crash does the killing.
**Result:** disaster that looks like mismanagement — perfect guild war weapon.

# Orsek operational update (1 paragraph, drop-in)

When **Schim indicators** appear, Orsek treat the scene as  **object crime + access crime** :

* assume a **Kemhak** is present,
* harden custody to prevent “safety doval,”
* build the **lifecycle clock** (how close to Molting/Manifest),
* and keep **coherent constructs** ready as short-burst repellents (finite fuel, finite time).

If you want the horror to really land on-page, the next best build is a  **“First Schim Scene Kit”** : one scene written from each Orsek POV (6 micro-sections) so you can hear how different minds interpret the same shadow — and how they turn fear into procedure before the light runs out.
