# Anthology Series Bible: Koldrik

**Thematic Reference:** [thematic_core.md](thematic_core.md)

## Premise & Core Direction
Mission-based responders + wet salvage/retrieval horror ("Aliens" chassis inside dark-fantasy/noir). Operating concept: Boiskem runs—standalone jobs tied by BUOY IDs, recurring minor, traveling cradle.

## Series Belief Tested
“You can plan for containment. You can’t plan for what it costs.”
**Thematic alignment:** This belief maps directly to the thematic pillars:
- **Containment** = holding the line against Plague and Entropy (Nature vs Plague vs Entropy)
- **Cost** = what Nature demands as fuel, what Language fails to capture, what gets burned anyway (Language/Reality)
## Schim Intensity, Counterplay, and Cost (8-book slate)

| Book | Intensity | Primary Counter | Cost Type |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| BUOY-17: Tide Case | Full | Coherence raise + Kemhak removal | Blood |
| BUOY-04: Cold Tow | Partial | Coherence corridor rails + Timing discipline | Time |
| LINECALL: Warehouse Hymn | Full | Kemhak removal | Reputation |
| BUOY-22: Wreck Court Siege | Partial | Coherence raise | Legitimacy |
| LINECALL: Quarantine Yard Keys | Full | Terrain denial + Coherence raise | Truth |
| BUOY-09: The Bell Diver | Partial → brief Full | Coherence pool-lighting + Timing discipline | Body |
| LINECALL: Stage Window | Full | Coherence routing | Innocents |
| BUOY-31: The Containment That Travels | Full | Kemhak removal (systemic) + deny re-seeding | Future |

## POV Structure
- Dual POV: Boiskem (containment/mission/horror) & Orsek (causation/aftermath/noir)
- Recurring duo anchors: Bram Skorin (Boiskem, believer/action-faith) & Marike Dravel (Orsek, cynic/truth-fatigue)
- Crew rotation: Size B core + Size C bench, per novella

## Cast (Conlang-Compliant Names)
### Boiskem Core
- Bram Skorin (lead POV)
- Joris Skelm (coherence tech)
- Tomas Veld (breacher)
- Riss Boien (diver/recovery)

### Boiskem Bench

## Comfort Arc (Books 1–8)
Collision → tactical respect → shared risk → final break.

## Story Elements & Scene Outline Example
- Boiskem Field Card: kit, counters, abort thresholds
- Orsek Field Card: timeline, receipts, witness protection, leverage
- Example: BUOY-17: Tide Case (dual-POV, 14-beat outline)
  - Mixing triggers
  - Coherence/perimeter tactics
  - Kemhak suspected compromise (Marike grabs secondary truth, Boiskem bags anchor)
  - Ending sting: containment holds, truth thins

## Stable Canon
- Boiskem private corporate unit
- Dual POV with recurring duo
- Package A names
- Asymmetric believer/cynic swap
- Series belief tested
- Schim in every book, intensity oscillation

## Flexible Elements
- Consortium name(s), faction details
- Bram’s background (ex-Stravak or lifer)
- Bench member rotation
- Traveling object/recurring minor
