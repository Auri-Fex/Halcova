# BUOY-17: Tide Case — Scene 2 (Senior Orsek Marike Dravel)

---

Edge of Cordon — Night

Marike Dravel’s boots slipped on the slick boards as she edged away from the others, breath coming fast, heart hammering in her chest. The fog pressed in, thick and cold, swallowing the world beyond the cordon. She could feel the weight of the team’s eyes on her back, Bram’s silent judgment, Deputy Marshal Tomas Veld’s muttered warnings, Junior Orsek Senn Rik’s anxious glances. None of it mattered. Not now.

She crouched by the edge, fingers numb as she traced the cordon’s boundary, the metal cold and wet beneath her gloves. The rules said not to cross, not to break protocol, but the rules had never seen fog like this. She could smell something sharp beneath the salt and oil, a tang that made her teeth ache. Her skin prickled, every hair on her arms standing up beneath her jacket.

A shape flickered in the mist, just beyond the line. Marike’s breath caught. She leaned forward, squinting, trying to make sense of the shifting white. For a moment, she thought she saw a figure—tall, thin, impossibly still. Then it was gone, swallowed by the fog.

She hesitated, mind racing through every protocol she’d memorized, every warning Bram had ever barked at her. The cordon was more than a line—it was a promise, a boundary between safety and whatever waited in the mist. But the rules felt brittle tonight, as if the fog itself was rewriting them. She pressed her palm to the metal, feeling the vibration of the dock, the pulse of the tide beneath her feet. The world felt thin, stretched.

She glanced back at the team. Tomas was hunched over the anchor bag, muttering to himself, eyes darting. Senn paced the perimeter, lantern swinging, casting wild shadows. Bram stood at the rail, a silhouette carved from stone, watching everything, saying nothing. Marike felt their tension like static, a charge in the air.

She knelt, breath fogging in the cold, and let her thoughts drift. She remembered her first job with Bram, the way he’d tested her, pushed her to the edge. She’d learned to trust her instincts, to read the weather, the water, the moods of the crew. Tonight, her instincts screamed at her to run, but curiosity was stronger. The fog was a puzzle, and she’d never been able to leave a puzzle unsolved.

The shape in the mist flickered again, closer this time. Marike’s heart hammered. She reached for her radio, thumb hovering over the call button, but she didn’t press it. Not yet. She needed proof, not panic.

Marike catalogued every sensation—the taste of iron, the reek of rot, the way the fog pulsed with its own heartbeat. She moved slowly, each step deliberate, feeling the ground shift beneath her boots. She remembered her mother’s warnings about the sea, about the things that waited in the dark. She shook it off, focusing on the present.

Marike fingered a charm at her neck—a piece of driftwood carved with a symbol from her childhood. She turned it over, feeling its rough edges, remembering the rituals she once believed would keep her safe. The fog pressed closer, and she wondered if any charm could help tonight.

Senn appeared, lantern swinging, eyes wide. “You see that?” he whispered. Marike nodded, voice low. “Something’s out there.” Senn’s grip tightened on her arm. “Don’t break protocol. Not tonight.” Marike pulled away, determination flaring. “If we wait, we die.”

Marike stepped over the cordon. The world changed. The air felt heavier, colder, as if she’d stepped into a different story. Her boots sank into something soft, not quite mud, not quite water. The fog thickened, pressing against her face, filling her nose and mouth with the taste of iron and rot.

Marike catalogued her fear, her curiosity, her need to prove herself. She moved deeper into the mist, senses sharpened, every nerve on edge. She knelt, brushing her glove over the surface. It came away slick with something dark. Blood. Marike’s breath caught. She looked up, and the fog parted for just a moment, revealing a shape sprawled on the ground—a body, twisted and broken, eyes wide and staring.

She stumbled back, choking on a scream. The fog closed in, hiding the corpse, but the image burned behind her eyes. Marike fumbled for her radio, voice shaking. “Bram, we’ve got a problem. There’s been a breach.”

The fog pulsed, alive with whispers. Marike felt something brush her leg, cold and slick. She kicked out, but there was nothing. The world was chaos: metal shrieking, voices rising, the dock groaning under their weight. She saw Senn rallying the team, Tomas pulling Bram to his feet, the perimeter dissolving into confusion.

Marike muttered, “If I die out here, tell Bram he owes me a drink.” Senn snorted. “You’ll haunt him for the rest of his life.”

Marike crawled back toward the cordon, fingers digging into the slick boards. The fog pressed in, whispering secrets, promising oblivion. She reached the boundary, collapsed against the metal, gasping for air. The team converged, voices rising, panic blooming. Bram knelt beside her, eyes hard. “What did you see?” Marike shook her head, unable to answer. The image of the body, the feeling of being watched, the certainty that something had crossed with her—all of it tangled in her mind.

Marike fingered the driftwood charm, feeling its weight. She closed her eyes, listening to the team, to the water, to the fog. She knew the rules were broken, that the night had changed. She wondered if any of them would see morning.
