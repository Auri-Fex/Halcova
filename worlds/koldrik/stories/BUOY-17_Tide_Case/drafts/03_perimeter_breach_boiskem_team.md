# BUOY-17: Tide Case — Scene 3 (Deputy Marshal Tomas Veld)

---

Perimeter — Night

Tomas Veld’s hands trembled as he checked the rails, the cold biting through his gloves. The fog was thicker now, a living thing, curling around the perimeter and swallowing every sound. He could hear the team’s voices, distant and muffled, as if they were already lost. The failed tow haunted him, a memory of metal grinding, cables snapping, the taste of blood in his mouth. Tonight, everything felt fragile.

He knelt by the anchor bag, fingers numb, and tried to focus on the task. Reinforce the rails, Marshal Bram Skorin had said. Keep the perimeter tight. But the equipment was old, the bolts rusted, the generator coughing out weak light. Tomas cursed under his breath, sardonic humor his only shield. “Should’ve brought a priest, not a mechanic.”

Senn appeared out of the mist, lantern swinging, eyes wide. “You see that?” he whispered. “Something moved.”

Tomas didn’t answer. He tightened a bolt, the metal shrieking. The sound echoed, unnatural, and the fog seemed to pulse in response. He catalogued every sensation: the sting of salt on his skin, the reek of oil, the taste of fear. The rails felt wrong, vibrating with a rhythm that didn’t match the tide.

A sudden crack split the night. The perimeter rail snapped, sending Tomas sprawling. He landed hard, pain lancing through his shoulder. The fog rushed in, cold and wet, filling his mouth with the taste of iron. He scrambled to his feet, heart pounding, and saw the team scattering, panic blooming.

Marike shouted, her voice sharp. “Perimeter’s breached! Get back!”

Bram was already moving, knife drawn, eyes scanning the mist. Senn stumbled, lantern swinging wild arcs. Tomas forced himself to move, to think. The breach was real, the threat undeniable. He grabbed the anchor bag, slung it over his shoulder, and ran toward the others.

The fog pressed closer, alive with whispers. Tomas felt something brush his leg, cold and slick. He kicked out, but there was nothing. The world was chaos: metal shrieking, voices rising, the dock groaning under their weight. He saw Bram rallying the team, Marike pulling Senn to his feet, the perimeter dissolving into confusion.

Tomas’s mind raced. He remembered the old stories, the warnings about the tide, the things that waited in the mist. He catalogued every motif: the failed tow, the broken rail, the team’s fear. He knew they had to adapt, to survive. He shouted, voice raw, “Regroup! Anchor bag, center!”

The team converged, battered and breathless. Tomas checked the rails, found them twisted and useless. The fog was thicker than ever, pressing against his skin, filling his lungs. He felt the weight of responsibility, the burden of expertise. Tonight, he was more than a mechanic—he was the last line of defense.

He looked at Bram, saw the doubt in his eyes. Marike was pale, jaw clenched. Senn clung to the lantern, knuckles white. Tomas forced a smile, bitter and sardonic. “Next time, we bring a priest and a welder.”

The team laughed, the sound brittle, but it was enough. They were together, for now. The breach had changed everything. The world was new, dangerous, and they would have to adapt or die.
