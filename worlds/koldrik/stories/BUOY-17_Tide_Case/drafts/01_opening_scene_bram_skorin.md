# BUOY-17: Tide Case — Opening Scene (Marshal Bram Skorin)

---

Perimeter Rail, Dockside — Night

Bram Skorin’s boots left salt streaks on the warped planks, each step a small betrayal of the silence. The fog pressed in, thick as old wool, swallowing the perimeter rail and the hunched shapes of the team. He could taste brine, feel it crusting his lips, the air so damp it clung to his skin and hair. Somewhere behind him, a chain clattered, the sound muffled and strange, and Bram’s hand went to the hilt of his knife out of habit, not hope.

He paused at the edge of the cordon, gloved hand resting on the slick metal. The hull loomed out of the mist, black and pitted, streaked with old paint and newer scars. The team was gathering, their voices low and sharp, every word edged with exhaustion. Senior Orsek Marike Dravel’s silhouette moved through the haze, shoulders squared, jaw set. Deputy Marshal Tomas Veld lingered by the anchor bag, eyes flicking from shadow to shadow, as if expecting the fog to spit out something worse than memory.

Bram glanced at the team, noting how they fell into their roles without a word. He was Marshal here, the one they looked to for orders when things got tense. Marike, the Senior Orsek, handled the investigation and kept the team’s nerves in check. Tomas, his Deputy Marshal, was always ready to step in if Bram faltered. Senn, the Junior Orsek, watched the perimeter, lantern swinging, alert for anything out of place. The hierarchy was clear, even in the fog—each knew their place, and each trusted the leaders to keep them alive.

Bram’s breath steamed in the air, mingling with the fog. He tried to count the bodies, make sure no one had slipped away, but the mist played tricks, doubling shapes, erasing faces. The failed tow still hung over them, a weight no one wanted to name. He could feel it in the way Marike snapped at Tomas, in the way Junior Orsek Senn Rik’s hands shook as he checked the rails. Even the dock itself seemed to sag under the burden.

He let his mind drift, cataloguing the night’s motifs: the failed tow, the living fog, the team’s exhaustion. He remembered the last time he’d stood on a dock like this, the world had been different. The air had tasted of hope, not dread. He remembered the sound of laughter, the slap of cards on a table, the way the team had once trusted each other. Now, every glance was a calculation, every silence a threat. The fog was not just weather—it was a wall, a boundary between what they were and what they had become.

He shifted his weight, feeling the ache in his knees, the old injury from the Kemhak job throbbing in the cold. The pain was familiar, almost comforting. It reminded him that he was still alive, still capable of fear. He watched Marike, her movements precise, deliberate. She was the only one who seemed untouched by the night, her resolve a shield against the creeping dread.

Tomas muttered something about the tide, his voice barely audible. Bram caught fragments—"wrong hour," "bad luck," "should’ve waited." He wanted to snap at him, tell him to shut up, but the words died in his throat. The team needed unity, not more cracks.

The fog thickened, swallowing the dock, the hull, the world beyond. Bram’s senses sharpened. He catalogued every sound: the distant slap of water, the creak of wood, the faint hum of the generator on the buoy. He smelled oil, salt, and something else—something metallic, sharp, almost sweet. It reminded him of blood, of old wounds.

A gull screamed somewhere out in the white, the sound thin and lost. Bram’s fingers tightened on the rail. The fog wasn’t right. It moved against the wind, curling in slow, deliberate eddies, as if it was watching them, waiting. He shivered, not from the cold.

He forced himself to speak, voice rough. “We’re all here. Let’s get this done before the tide turns.” The words fell flat, swallowed by the mist. No one answered. The team assembled, but the air between them was brittle, ready to crack.

Marike’s boots thudded on the planks as she approached, her face a pale smudge. “You want to call the roll, Bram, or just stand there brooding?”

He grunted, not rising to the bait. “Tomas, check the anchor. Senn, perimeter. Marike, with me.”

Tomas moved off, shoulders hunched, muttering under his breath. Senn’s lantern bobbed in the fog, a faint orange glow swallowed almost instantly. Marike fell in beside Bram, her breath quick and sharp.

“Fog’s wrong,” she said, voice low. “It’s moving against the wind.”

“I know.”

She glanced at him, eyes narrowed. “You think it’s them?”

Bram shook his head. “Doesn’t feel like Kemhak. Feels older.”

A silence stretched between them, thick as the mist. Bram listened to the creak of the dock, the distant slap of water against the hull. Every sound felt amplified, unnatural. He could smell oil, salt, and something else—something metallic, sharp, almost sweet.

Senn’s voice came out of the fog, thin and strained. “Anchor’s clear. No sign of tampering.”

“Perimeter’s holding,” Tomas called, though his voice wavered.

Bram nodded, more to himself than anyone else. “We keep watch in pairs. No one goes alone. If you see anything—anything—you call it out.”

Marike’s lips twisted in a humorless smile. “You expecting company?”

“Always.”

He turned back to the rail, eyes straining for movement. The fog pressed closer, and for a moment, he thought he saw something move within it—something that didn’t belong. He blinked, and it was gone. Just the cold, the silence, and the sense that the world was holding its breath, waiting for them to make the first mistake.

Bram walked the perimeter, boots thudding on the planks, each step measured and deliberate. He checked the anchor, the lines, the generator, fingers numb from the cold. The fog pressed against his skin, damp and heavy, making every movement feel slow, weighted. He found Marike staring into the mist, jaw clenched, eyes distant. “You see anything?” he asked, voice low. She shook her head. “Just ghosts.” He almost laughed, but the sound stuck in his throat. “We’ve got enough of those.”

He paused, letting the silence settle. The dock creaked beneath him, the water slapped against the hull, and somewhere in the distance, a gull screamed again. Bram closed his eyes, letting the sounds wash over him, trying to anchor himself in the present. But memories intruded—

Bram remembered a job in Kemhak, years ago. The fog had been thinner then, but the fear was the same. Cables snapped, metal shrieked, blood spattered the deck. He’d tasted iron, felt the sting of salt in open wounds. The team had laughed afterward, brittle jokes about ghosts and bad luck, trying to chase away the dread. Tonight, there was no laughter. Only the slow, grinding weight of exhaustion and fear.

Bram reached into his pocket, fingers closing around a jagged piece of rail. A token from Kemhak, a reminder of what failure cost. He turned it over, feeling the rough metal bite into his palm. The fog pressed closer, thick and suffocating. He wondered if this night would end the same way—loss, regret, blood on the planks.

Tomas returned, face pale, eyes darting. “Tide’s shifting. We need to move.” Bram nodded, voice steady. “We’re not leaving until we finish the job.” The team gathered at the hull, tools in hand, faces drawn and tense. Bram watched them, saw the fear, the exhaustion, the flicker of hope in Marike’s eyes. He remembered stories told over cheap whiskey, promises made in the dark. He wondered how many would survive the night.

The fog thickened, crawling over Bram’s skin, seeping into his bones. He gripped his knife, knuckles white. “Stay sharp,” he said. “No mistakes.” The work began—metal scraping against metal, voices rising and falling, the dock creaking beneath their weight. Bram moved from task to task, checking, double-checking, never letting his guard down. He felt the eyes of the fog on him, felt the weight of the past pressing in, every mistake echoing in the silence.

Marike muttered, “If we make it out, I’m burning these boots.” Tomas snorted. “I’ll burn the whole dock.” Bram almost smiled, but the fog swallowed it, leaving only the taste of salt and regret.

As the hours passed, the team grew quieter, movements slower. Bram caught Marike watching him, her gaze unreadable. He wondered what she saw—a leader, a liability, a ghost. The fog shifted, revealing the water below, black and endless. Bram stared into it, searching for answers, for hope. He found only his own reflection, distorted and strange, eyes hollow, mouth set in a grim line.

Bram fingered the broken rail again, feeling its weight, its history. He turned away, heart pounding, breath steaming in the cold. The night was far from over. The real horror had yet to begin.

A gull screamed somewhere out in the white, the sound thin and lost. Bram’s fingers tightened on the rail. The fog wasn’t right. It moved against the wind, curling in slow, deliberate eddies, as if it was watching them, waiting. He shivered, not from the cold.

He forced himself to speak, voice rough. “We’re all here. Let’s get this done before the tide turns.” The words fell flat, swallowed by the mist. No one answered. The team assembled, but the air between them was brittle, ready to crack.

He grunted, not rising to the bait. “Tomas, check the anchor. Senn, perimeter. Marike, with me.”

Tomas moved off, shoulders hunched, muttering under his breath. Senn’s lantern bobbed in the fog, a faint orange glow swallowed almost instantly. Marike fell in beside Bram, her breath quick and sharp.

“Fog’s wrong,” she said, voice low. “It’s moving against the wind.”
