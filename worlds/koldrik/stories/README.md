# Koldrik Anthology Stories

**Thematic Reference:** [../thematic_core.md](../thematic_core.md)

**Thematic Pillars:**
- *Everything is fuel. Everything rots. The question is what you burn and how long it lasts.* (Nature/Plague/Entropy)
- *The pattern defines the possible. But some things exist whether you name them or not.* (Language/Reality)

This folder will contain drafts, outlines, scene cards, and compiler files for the 8-book slate and related novella/episode content. 

Compiler process will follow the Orrovae model: 
- Canon and story elements are staged in markdown files
- Scene cards, beat sheets, and POV breakdowns are organized for each book
- Drafts and revisions are tracked for each story

Start by specifying which book or story element to compile first, or request a template for compiler workflow.
