# Anthology Series Tracker: Koldrik

**Thematic Reference:** [../thematic_core.md](../thematic_core.md)

Tracks all 8 books in the series, with detailed metadata, content rating, foreshadowing, and seeding notes. Use this to maintain continuity, pacing, and thematic development across the anthology.

**Thematic Pillars:**
- **Nature vs Plague vs Entropy:** *Everything is fuel. Everything rots. The question is what you burn and how long it lasts.*
- **Language / Reality:** *The pattern defines the possible. But some things exist whether you name them or not.*
