## Reviewing: World Bible v1.0 (Constructcraft + Quiet Blood) • City Layer v0.1 • Institutional Web v0.1 • Orsek Crew v0.1 • Koldrik conlang pipeline + lexicon • B-Track supernatural patch (Akslur / Vlokim / Kemhak) + integration updates

# WORLD BIBLE v1.1 — Constructcraft + Quiet Blood + Akslur (B-Track)

A dark fantasy / neo-noir city where guilds fight economic wars through “accidents,” counterfeits, shortages, and crowd pressure — while investigators (Orsek) try to prove causes inside a system designed to smooth trouble away. The only usable human “magic” is Constructcraft (hard-light constructs). The only other supernatural phenomenon is hostile and deniable: Akslur intrusion, typically induced through Vlokim using a planted Kemhak.

**Thematic Reference:** [thematic_core.md](thematic_core.md)

---

## 0) One-line pitch

Hard-light constructs are produced by etched lens-coins and powered by biolight (often stored as levpekel). The city's real war is bureaucratic and economic — violence disguised as failure. In the background, a hostile behind-layer (Akslur) can be carried in via curse-objects (Kemhak), turning "accidents" into something worse — while coherent light keeps it away only as long as the fuel and hardware hold.

## 0.1) Thematic Pillars

**Nature vs Plague vs Entropy:** *Everything is fuel. Everything rots. The question is what you burn and how long it lasts.*
- **Nature:** Biolight (what life produces, what tools consume)
- **Plague:** Akslur/Vlokim (hostile ecology that feeds on Nature)
- **Entropy:** Degradation ladders, rot, wear (the only universal law)

**Language / Reality:** *The pattern defines the possible. But some things exist whether you name them or not.*
- Etched patterns are literal language-as-reality
- Akslur exists outside the pattern system
- The battle is over which words become official

---

## 1) The two supernatural facts (tight, non-expanding)

### 1.1 Usable human phenomenon: Constructcraft

The ability to instantiate **hard-light constructs** (solid, load-bearing photonic lattices) using:

* **Biolight fuel** (live draw or stored fuel)
* **Etched hardware** (lens-coins / substrate patterns)
* **Calibration and wear limits** (keying + degradation)

### 1.2 Hostile world phenomenon: Akslur (B-Track)

**Akslur** is a hostile “behind-layer” that can **briefly seat** into physical space under low-coherence conditions. Humans do not “cast” Akslur. Humans can, however, induce and weaponize its contact through **Vlokim** (curse condition), typically anchored by a **Kemhak** (planted fetish object).

**Common speech** calls Vlokim “a curse.” In-world, they code-switch.

**Thematic role (Plague):** Akslur/Vlokim is a competing ecology that feeds on what Nature produces. It doesn't hate—it feeds. It can be contained but not reasoned with. It exists outside the pattern/language system entirely.

---

## 2) Constructcraft system (core)

### 2.1 Biolight fuel

Biolight is extracted from living metabolic processes and converted into coherent structure.

**Thematic role (Nature):** Biolight is not benevolent—it's fuel. What life produces, tools consume. The question is always what you're willing to burn.

**Fuel qualities**

* **Output:** how much construct exists at once
* **Sustain:** how long it holds
* **Coherence:** precision/rigidity/sharpness

**Fuel sourcing modes**

* **Self-fuel** (safer, limited, tragic)
* **Touch-fuel** (predatory, requires contact/near contact)
* **Crowd-fuel** (industrial/systemic; legal only in licensed windows)

### 2.2 Stored biolight: levpekel (fuel-in-a-case)

Biolight can be stored in a **lens case** as stabilized fuel (levpekel). This enables pre-loaded use without needing real-time harvesting during every action.

**Core consequences**

* Storage is never perfect: levpekel **rots** (loss of Cut/coherence) and can become unstable.
* Storage creates a new horror:  **parasitic leak** .

### 2.3 Parasitic leak (case leak)

A leaking case doesn’t “hurt someone nearby” like radiation. It **consumes the carrier’s biolight** to maintain its own stability. In effect, the case becomes hungry.

**Leak severity ladder (operational, readable in scenes)**

1. **Seip** — chill, fatigue, low heat; “bad weather” plausible
2. **Zuik** — tremor + nausea + focus slips; recovery is slow; worsens near the case
3. **Bit** — sharp drain episodes (fainting, arrhythmia risk, vision artifacts); high danger under stress
4. **Crash** — sustained drain; cannot safely carry or operate constructs; collapse risk spikes

(These are physiological tells, not mysticism.)

---

## 3) Lens-coins (form + interface)

A lens-coin is a palm-sized photonic circuit defining:

* **what can be made** (pattern library)
* **how stable** it is (resolution)
* **how it fails** (wear profile)

**Thematic role (Language/Reality):** Etched patterns are literal language-as-reality. The pattern defines what can exist. Pattern libraries are vocabularies of the possible. Those who control the catalogs control what can be spoken into being.

**Anatomy**

* **Ring (metal):** phase stability + signature retention
* **Core (saintglass / opalized resin):** etch substrate
* **Etches:** blueprint lattices
* **Key layer:** calibration imprint (living signature coupling)
* **Wear state:** cumulative damage from use

### 3.1 Blueprint carriers (what can hold patterns)

Blueprints can be etched/embedded into  **purpose-built substrates** , not “anything.” Canon carriers include:

* **Lens-coin cores** (primary pattern store)
* **Host plates / inserts** (swap-in etched plates for specific constructs)
* **Case-liners** (safe patterns, stabilizers, or controlled-release shapes)
* **Tool-mount guides** (simple utility forms: clamps, wedges, lock guides)
* **Structural tiles/plates** used in public works (authorized, limited catalogs)

(Constraint stays: no freeform “anything.” It’s a library, not imagination magic.)

---

## 4) Core rules (A + B) + Proof Scars

### Rule A: Living Calibration (personal keying)

Coins are calibrated to a living physiological signature (pulse rhythm, breath cadence, micro-tremor profile, heat-map distribution). Not thoughts, not emotion.

**Non-keyed use** is possible but degraded:

* weaker output, unstable coherence
* higher failure risk
* greater fuel drain

### Rule B: Etches degrade (entropy smear)

Every activation damages the lattice.

**Thematic role (Entropy):** This is the only universal law. Every use brings the tool closer to failure. You can't prevent degradation—you can only manage it long enough to accomplish something.

**Degradation ladder**

1. Flicker
2. Drift
3. Razor Bloom
4. Backscatter
5. Lattice Collapse

### Proof Scars (security layer)

An elite upgrade (biometric second factor) that makes theft insufficient. Coins can require:

1. coin integrity
2. living calibration
3. proof scar match

Failure often produces refusal or “dirty burn” (higher bloom/backscatter likelihood).

---

## 5) 1860–1880 tech baseline (how it sits differently)

This world’s “modernity” is  **in materials and institutions** , not electronics.

* Logistics: wagons, rail yards, docks, cranes, scaffolds — sabotage has physical plausibility.
* Communication: messengers, postings, lantern codes, word-of-mouth cascades.
* Forensics: tool marks, rivet stamps, oil cuts, grit in flour, stress halos in substrates — procedural, tactile.
* Medicine: symptom timing and exposure effects are interpreted through period-credible practice (no scanners), making Mildan-style field medicine powerful and grounded.

Net effect: Constructcraft feels like  **industrial arcana** , not “superhero beams.”

---

## 6) Akslur layer (B-Track) — integrated, not spellcasting

### 6.1 Definitions (locked)

* **Akslur:** the hostile behind-layer (formerly “the veil”)
* **Vlokim:** the curse condition (common speech still says “curse”)
* **Kemhak:** the planted fetish/anchor object

### 6.2 What Vlokim is (Proposal B)

Vlokim is not a bolt of magic. It is  **seeded infestation** :

* A **Kemhak** is built using sympathetic tag (hair/sweat cloth/thread) and a carrier medium.
* The Kemhak **feeds** on biolight slowly over time.
* As it attunes, it creates **local coherence failure** around the target — turning small errors into consistent failures.

### 6.3 Lifecycle ladder (Aliens spine)

0. **Planted** — no symptoms, only access crime
1. **Feeding** — subtle drain + mild bad luck
2. **Attuning** — failures become consistent and target-linked
3. **Molting** — one sharp escalation event (danger spike)
4. **Manifest** — brief seating in low-coherence conditions (dark/smoke/fog/stale levpekel/leak-heavy proximity)

### 6.4 Why light repels it (and why light still runs out)

Coherent hard-light lattices act as a hostile boundary: Akslur seating collapses under coherence.
Defense remains finite because:

* fuel is finite (and stored fuel rots)
* coins degrade
* leak states worsen under stress

Akslur doesn’t replace your failure mechanics; it **biases** them toward catastrophe at the worst moments.

## 7) The city (City Layer v0.1, locked)

**Districts (Charter → street):**

* **Hograad → Hograd** (high quarter)
* **Markveld → Marvel** (market ward)
* **Werkslag → Werslag** (works ring)
* **Havkade → Havkad** (docks/canal)
* **Mengvenst-Rij → Menvri** (licensed venues row)
* **Kwarwerf → Kwerf** (quarantine/custody yard)
* **Sporhek → Sporek** (rail gate/yards)
* **Koudstraat → Kustra** (cold ward)

### Licensed crowd windows (power tides)

Crowd-fuel is legal only inside licensed windows:

* **Stage Window** (venues on Menvri)
* **Works Window** (limited public works draw at shift edges, rare)
* **Festival Window** (largest, highest-risk nights)

### Akslur risk map overlay (no new places, just usage)

Higher likelihood of Vlokim progression / Manifest conditions:

* **Havkad** (fog/cold/water)
* **Kustra** (low heat)
* **Kwerf** (storage + laundering opportunity)
* **Menvri** (smoke/crowds/windows)

---

## 8) Institutional web (v0.1, locked)

### Guild/trade blocks (7)

* **Kraenbond → Kran** (rig & lift)
* **Ketwerk → Ket** (chain & bolt)
* **Sainthuis → Saint** (glasswrights)
* **Opalwerf → Opal** (resin growers)
* **Brugraad → Brug** (public works wardens)
* **Venraad → Ven** (licensed venues consortium)
* **Sporbond → Spor** (carters & rail union)

### Underwriters (3)

* **Huis Borg → Borguis** (access product)
* **Huis Zegel → Zel** (custody legitimacy)
* **Huis Begro → Bro** (budgets / “public safety contracts”)

### Pattern libraries

* **Etsraad (Ets)** — conservative catalogs
* **Lenshof (Lhof)** — elite custom work
* **Rotsnede (Rot)** — illicit copy mill

### Calibration clinics

* **Stemhuis (Stem)** — legitimate network
* Black-market “back-stem rooms” exist (unnamed; no new naming added)

### Custody sites

* **Kwarf** (main yard)
* **Kwartor → Ktor** (overflow tower)

---

## 9) Law & Order operating model (as used in-story)

* **Stravak** : state-owned order control — cordons, crowd management, immediate containment.
* **Orsek** : private investigators — hired and funded through borg/surety channels; they pursue causation and accountability and constantly collide with convenience, liability, and cover-ups.

(Procedural conflict is the engine: the watch can stop chaos; Orsek try to stop the lie.)

---

## 10) Orsek crew (names locked) + POV roles

* **Reklar** — lead; sequence, motive-pressure, narrative control of the case
* **Skerin** — etch/host specialist; material truth, counterfeit tells, wear-state reading
* **Mildan** — body/physiology; leak timing, donor crash, backscatter-like effects
* **Kostek** — borg/access wrangler; terms, denial, leverage, entry rights
* **Ruvak** — Stravak liaison; cordon reality, custody friction, crowd temperature
* **Bradu** — field runner; chokepoints, retrievals, tails, “what disappears next”

### Orsek procedural update (integration requirement)

Add an internal protocol flag to ersles (first-read):
**“Kemhak suspected”** triggers:

* targeted anchor search (case seams, coat hems, bedding, tool rolls, lockers)
* no bare-hand handling of candidate objects
* symptom timing interview bundle (Mildan)
* stored-fuel rot check in relevant rooms/containers (Skerin + Mildan)
* custody hardening to prevent “safety doval” destruction (Ruvak + Kostek)

---

## 11) Quiet Blood series engine (story spine)

“Quiet Blood” is the method of killing and control:

* tool-failure murders
* contamination hits
* street pressure events
* respectable distance through contractors

**Season arc (5 books) remains:**

1. strike pattern → enforcer school signature
2. counterfeit “peace” → trust capture via inspectors
3. wage riot → private enforcement arm
4. charterless → fugitive proof + governance exposure
5. subscription crown → least-worst governance fight

### New integration: Vlokim-as-a-service (bounded)

Vlokim is a premium tactic within Quiet Blood:

* requires access (plant Kemhak)
* requires time (lifecycle)
* requires feed (biolight trickle)
* remains deniable (looks like failure/weakness/weather)

---

## 12) Open dials (status)

### Constructcraft dials (locked from prior “do it”)

* Lens-coins: regulated but present enough to matter (black market exists)
* Crowd-fuel: legal only inside licensed windows (Menvri + rare public works + festivals)
* Proof scars: elite-leaning practice (not universal)
* Re-keying: possible but expensive and ethically rotten in black markets
* Degradation: meaningful per job; extended fights burn tools

### Akslur/Vlokim dials (not locked yet)

* Manifest duration (seconds vs minutes)
* Whether coherent constructs repel only vs can injure
* Seeding difficulty (specialists vs broader craft)
* Attune speed (days vs weeks)
* Framing reliability (miskeying a Kemhak to blame someone else)

---

## 13) Koldrik conlang pipeline (repeatable, practical)

**Baseline root language:** Dutch (as raw material), then "molted" into Koldrik.

**Core transforms**

* sch → **sk**
* ch → **k**
* aa/oo/ee → **a/o/e**
* ij → **i**
* drop weak endings like **-en** in street speech
* clip Charter compounds into 4–7 letter street forms
* prefer hard consonants and tight vowels for street words

**Code-switching rule**

* Charter/legal speech uses longer compounds.
* Street speech uses molted forms.
* Characters mix English translations ("curse") with Koldrik terms (Vlokim) naturally.

**Locked Koldrik supernatural terms**

* **Akslur** (behind-layer)
* **Vlokim** (curse condition)
* **Kemhak** (planted fetish/anchor object)

---

## 14) Quick glossary (project use)

* **Constructcraft** : hard-light constructs via lens-coins + biolight
* **Lens-coin** : etched photonic tool (pattern library)
* **Levpekel** : stored biolight fuel (case-held), rots over time
* **Leak** : parasitic drain from storage/kit on the carrier
* **Proof scars** : biometric second factor for coins
* **Stravak** : state order control
* **Orsek** : private investigators
* **Borg** : surety/access leverage
* **Slag** : custody/impound evidence state
* **Akslur** : hostile behind-layer
* **Vlokim** : curse condition (common speech: “curse”)
* **Kemhak** : planted fetish/anchor object enabling Vlokim

# Anthology Series Canon Update (Jan 2026)

## 8-book slate: Schim intensity, counterplay, and cost

**Key**

* **Intensity:** Signs → Environment → Partial → Full
* **Primary counter:** (1) **Coherence raise** (hard-light lattices/rails), (2) **Kemhak removal** (anchor hunt/bag), (3) **Terrain denial** (light/airflow/fog/smoke control), plus **Timing discipline** (survive the window)
* **Cost type:** what the belief extracts: *“You can plan for containment. You can’t plan for what it costs.”*

### 1) **BUOY-17: Tide Case**

* **Intensity:** **Full**
* **Primary counter:** **Coherence raise + Kemhak removal** (perimeter + bag the anchor)
* **Cost type:** **Blood** (injury/maiming to hold the line)

### 2) **BUOY-04: Cold Tow**

* **Intensity:** **Partial** (inside-the-hull dread; limited contact)
* **Primary counter:** **Coherence corridor rails + Timing discipline**
* **Cost type:** **Time** (missed window → ambush/seizure; defenses burn out)

### 3) **LINECALL: Warehouse Hymn**

* **Intensity:** **Full**
* **Primary counter:** **Kemhak removal** (anchor hunt under breach/clear pressure)
* **Cost type:** **Reputation** (scapegoat / “operator error” narrative)

### 4) **BUOY-22: Wreck Court Siege**

* **Intensity:** **Partial** (public “wake-up” event; not a prolonged fight)
* **Primary counter:** **Coherence raise** in a hostile civilian environment
* **Cost type:** **Legitimacy** (authority flips; Boiskem framed as hazard)

### 5) **LINECALL: Quarantine Yard Keys**

* **Intensity:** **Full**
* **Primary counter:** **Terrain denial + Coherence raise** (floodlights + lattice fences)
* **Cost type:** **Truth** (forced silence bargain to prevent riot/market panic)

### 6) **BUOY-09: The Bell Diver**

* **Intensity:** **Partial → brief Full** (one nasty contact beat)
* **Primary counter:** **Coherence pool-lighting + Timing discipline** (water/fog keeps trying to drop it)
* **Cost type:** **Body** (permanent loss: fingers, vision, lung capacity)

### 7) **LINECALL: Stage Window**

* **Intensity:** **Full**
* **Primary counter:** **Coherence routing** (funnel the crowd; hold rails long enough)
* **Cost type:** **Innocents** (triage math: save mass, lose a pocket)

### 8) **BUOY-31: The Containment That Travels**

* **Intensity:** **Full**
* **Primary counter:** **Kemhak removal (systemic)** + deny re-seeding
* **Cost type:** **Future** (burn the ladder: go outlaw / expose patrons / destroy a protection network)

This keeps “Aliens in the middle”: every book is a Schim case, but intensity oscillates so the creature doesn’t become routine.

---

# Comprehensive write-up: what we added/changed/updated

## What we set as the anthology’s core direction

* We chose **A+B**: **mission-based responders** + **wet salvage/retrieval horror** (“Aliens” chassis inside your dark-fantasy/noir world).
* We renamed the whole operating concept into **Boiskem runs**: standalone “jobs” tied by light connective tissue (BUOY IDs, recurring minor, traveling cradle).

## Canon decision: what Boiskem *are*

* **Boiskem are private (Option 2A)**: a **corporate hazard containment + asset recovery unit** contracted by a consortium.
* They are **separate from Stravak** (beat/cordon) and **Orsek** (investigation).
* Some Boiskem are **ex-Stravak/ex-Orsek**, creating built-in friction, guilt, and cross-competence.

### Boiskem mandate stack (locked)

1. **Primary:** contain escalation + recover/secure the asset (control the object)
2. **Secondary:** liability suppression (witness/narrative control)
3. **Tertiary:** triage intel (not full investigation)

This was explicitly chosen to preserve noir: **who controls the object controls the story**.

## Canon decision: Orsek side is real and recurring

* We locked a **Dual POV structure** (Option 4): each novella has:

	* **Boiskem POV** for containment (the mission/horror)
	* **Orsek POV** for causation/aftermath (the noir)

This gives you X-files rhythm: monster pressure + human coverup.

## Canon decision: the belief tested (series theme)

We set the series belief tested (Hybrid) to:

> **“You can plan for containment. You can’t plan for what it costs.”**

Then we made it operational:

* the plan often works,
* containment is competent,
* the *cost* is where tragedy/noir lives (blood, blame, silence, innocents, future).

## Canon decision: Schim presence policy (Aliens heartbeat)

* **Every book is a Schim case**, but **not every book has full contact**.
* We set an **intensity oscillation** across 8 books (Full vs Partial) to keep dread alive.

## Canon decision: conlang-compliant names

You required names to come from your conlang pipeline. We locked **Package A** as canon, with Charter (long) vs street (molted/clipped) forms.

### Duo anchors (recurring POVs)

* **Marike Dravel** *(Charter: Marijke Draaiveld)* — Orsek
* **Bram Skorin** *(Charter: Bram Schoren)* — Boiskem

### Orsek roster (Size B core + Size C bench)

Core 3:

* **Marike Dravel** (lead POV)
* **Senn Rik** *(Senne Rijck)* (field partner)
* **Verle Koen** *(Veerle Koenen)* (analyst)

Bench:

* **Nils Fen** *(Nijls Fenner)* (runner)
* **Ota Wran** *(Otta Wraanen)* (fixer liaison)

### Boiskem roster (Size B core + Size C bench)

Core 4:

* **Bram Skorin** (lead POV)
* **Joris Skelm** *(Joris Schermel)* (coherence tech)
* **Tomas Veld** *(Thomas Veldman)* (breacher)
* **Riss Boien** *(Ritse Boeijen)* (diver/recovery)

Bench:

* **Halen Vrink** *(Haalen Vrincken)* (medic)
* **Kaat Vervo** *(Kaatje Vervooen)* (handler)

## Canon decision: crew size model and rotation

* **On-page default:** **Size B** (Boiskem 4 / Orsek 3)
* **Bench known:** Size C add-ons exist and rotate in/out per novella.
* **Rotation rule:** Bram + 2 core + 1 bench for Boiskem; Marike + 1 core + 1 bench for Orsek.

This keeps scenes tight while allowing variety and deaths without collapsing the series.

## Canon decision: the X-files “duo comfort arc” — with the swap

We swapped the “believer/cynic” assignments with the **asymmetric** version:

* **Bram (Boiskem) = believer** (action-faith: people can be saved; the line can hold)
* **Marike (Orsek) = cynic** (truth-fatigue: the system eats evidence; outcomes don’t follow truth)

Why it works:

* Boiskem belief = *field courage / rescue impulse* (not “belief in the corporation”)
* Orsek cynicism = *epistemic noir* (truth exists; leverage is unreliable)

We mapped a comfort ladder across Books 1–8:

* collision → tactical respect → shared risk → final break.

## What we drafted in outline form so far

* We created a **Boiskem Field Card** conceptually (kit, counters, abort thresholds).
* We created an **Orsek Field Card** conceptually (timeline, receipts, witness protection, leverage).
* We drafted **BUOY-17: Tide Case** as a **dual-POV 14-beat** outline with:

	* mixing triggers,
	* coherence/perimeter tactics,
	* Kemhak suspected compromise (Marike grabs secondary truth while Boiskem bags anchor),
	* ending sting: containment holds, truth thins.

---

## What’s now stable canon vs flexible

### Stable (locked)

* Boiskem private corporate unit (2A)
* Dual POV with recurring duo
* Package A names
* Asymmetric believer/cynic swap
* Series belief tested
* Schim in every book, intensity oscillation

### Flexible (easy to adjust)

* Exact consortium name(s) and which faction they answer to
* Whether Bram is ex-Stravak or corporate lifer (either still works)
* Which bench members appear in which book
* The exact traveling object (cradle/crate) and recurring minor (dispatcher/registrar)

---

If you want the next concrete deliverable, I can turn this into a **single “Anthology Series Bible” page** (cast, premise, belief, Schim rules, slate) and then expand **Book 1** into full **scene cards** with plaques + coherence level + Schim window probability + cost escalation notes.
