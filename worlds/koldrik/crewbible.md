## Anthology Canon Update (Jan 2026)

Crew structure now follows the anthology’s dual POV format: Boiskem (containment) and Orsek (aftermath/noir). Size B core and Size C bench are canon, with rotation rules and conlang-compliant names as described in worldbible.md. See story_doc.md for full cast and POV breakdowns.
**Thematic Reference:** [thematic_core.md](thematic_core.md)

**Crew thematic roles:**
- **Boiskem** = Holders (maintaining structure against Entropy and Plague)
- **Orsek** = Namers (making language stick to reality)
# ORSEK CREW (Core + Bench)

Core 3:
* Marike Dravel (lead POV)
* Senn Rik (field partner)

# REKLAR — Lead Orsek (Case Lead / Narrative Control)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** the one who decides what the case *is* before the city decides it for him.
* **Default stance:** calm, exacting, allergic to convenient explanations.
* **Outside vibe:** looks like someone who hasn’t fully forgiven the world for being improv theater.

### What Reklar actually does

* Frames the case into  **provable questions** : *Who had access? What changed? What had to be true for this failure to happen?*
* Manages  **people-pressure** : witnesses, guild foremen, Stravak, underwriters.
* Keeps the crew moving when “more data” is just fear in a hat.

### Background (kept plausible, not sprawling)

* Came up around **Marvel / Werslag** jobs as a clerk’s kid who learned early that “accident” is a word people buy.
* Not guild-bred, not noble-touched — which makes him useful and resented.

### Constructcraft relationship

* **Not a flashy coin-user.** He understands constructs like a foreman understands cranes: rules, load paths, failure likelihood.
* If he carries a coin at all, it’s for **simple coherence tools** (barrier wedge / glare screen) and he uses it like a fire extinguisher: reluctantly and early.

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* Treats it as  **a crime with an object** , never as folklore.
* Does not talk about Schim unless forced — not denial, just discipline.

### POV tells (what he notices)

* What people  **don’t answer** .
* Who uses the word “routine.”
* Hands: soot under nails, callus patterns, ink stains, tremor timing.
* Tool placement: *what’s been moved since the “incident.”*

### Likes / dislikes (grounded)

* Likes: quiet rooms, clean timelines, honest witnesses who are scared but trying.
* Dislikes: “I was just helping” (often means laundering), sentimental speeches, guild politeness that arrives with a knife behind it.

### Stress tells

* Gets **more polite** the angrier he is.
* Writes short lists on anything handy (wood scrap, receipt back, slate corner).

### Weakness

* He can overfit a narrative — if he’s not careful, he’ll force chaos to have a motive.

### Personal texture (outside-life, small)

* Keeps a cheap kettle and a chipped cup; drinks tea like it’s a moral commitment.
* Has one recurring off-hours obligation he never names in detail (a dependent, a debt, or a promise) — it’s a pressure point, not an arc.

---

# SKERIN — Materials / Etch / Counterfeit Specialist (The “How” Person)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** turns “it failed” into  *exactly why it failed and who could have made it fail that way* .
* **Default stance:** skeptical, tactile, a little grimly amused by how often humans bet their lives on bad rivets.

### What Skerin actually does

* Reads **wear state** without romanticizing it.
* Spots counterfeit tells: bad alloy smell, wrong file angle, weak chain bite, smeared lattice edges.
* Makes “invisible” proof visible: rubbings, scrapings, stress halos, edge drift.

### Background

* Ex-trade adjacent: either apprenticed and left, or trained by someone who wanted them quiet.
* Has worked **Saintglass** and **opalized resin** enough to know when someone is lying about what they used.

### Constructcraft relationship

* **Most competent coin-handler on the team** in a technical sense.
* Uses coins the way a surgeon uses tools: minimal flourish, maximum correctness.
* Knows levpekel rot like a cook knows spoilage — by smell, haze, and how it clings.

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* The first to say: “If it’s Vlokim, the Kemhak is somewhere dumb.”
* Doesn’t fear Schim as a monster; fears it as **a wrench thrown into physics** when physics was already stressed.

### POV tells

* Hears failure before it happens (chain singing wrong; pin tension; timber complaining).
* Tracks environments: humidity, soot, grit, oil sheen, cold pockets.

### Likes / dislikes

* Likes: clean fractures (honest breaks), good tools, someone admitting they don’t know.
* Dislikes: polished lies, “brand-new” gear that’s too clean, anyone touching a scene to “tidy.”

### Stress tells

* Runs a thumb along edges unconsciously.
* Goes very quiet right before an action beat.

### Weakness

* Can get tunnel vision on mechanism and miss the human chess move.

### Personal texture

* Keeps a tiny tin of abrasive paste and a cloth like it’s a lucky charm (it isn’t; it’s just useful).
* Avoids certain venues on Menvri for reasons they pretend are “noise.”

# MILDAN — Body / Fuel / Triage Specialist (The “Cost” Person)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** makes the magic’s harm legible and keeps people alive long enough to testify.
* **Default stance:** practical, steady, not sentimental — but not cold.

### What Mildan actually does

* Reads **leak severity** in the body (seip/zuik/bit/crash) without guesswork.
* Identifies donor crash waves and backscatter-like symptoms.
* Tells the crew what the body can still do  **today** , not what it “should” do in theory.

### Background

* Trained in a rough, real way: clinic work, field injuries, crowd incidents.
* Has treated enough “accidents” to recognize patterned harm.

### Constructcraft relationship

* Doesn’t need to use coins to be essential.
* Knows the difference between: fuel exhaustion, levpekel rot exposure, panic, and “something else.”

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* Treats Vlokim like an infection with a clock.
* Most likely to insist on containment and to win arguments by being correct and undramatic.

### POV tells

* Measures time by **symptom onset** and  **recovery lag** .
* Watches breath cadence, lip color, finger heat, tremor rhythm.
* Notices who’s been sleeping and who’s been surviving.

### Likes / dislikes

* Likes: clean water, predictable routines, people who follow instructions the first time.
* Dislikes: heroic posturing, cheap spirits “for pain,” anyone moving a victim before she’s read them.

### Stress tells

* Counts under their breath without realizing.
* Gets sharper, not louder.

### Weakness

* Can become ruthless about triage — which is correct and sometimes socially disastrous.

### Personal texture

* Has a small kit that’s always complete. If something is missing, it’s because someone stole it, not because Mildan forgot.
* One soft spot they deny: animals, kids, or old workers (pick per story when needed).

# KOSTEK — Access / Underwriter Pressure / Terms Wrangler (The “Door” Person)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** gets the crew into places the city doesn’t want them, and keeps them there long enough to find receipts.
* **Default stance:** charming when it helps, blunt when it doesn’t.

### What Kostek actually does

* Handles borg pressure, liability threats, and “we can’t allow that” conversations.
* Finds leverage that isn’t paperwork-heavy: who needs what  **today** .
* Coordinates safehouses, witnesses, and the boring logistics that keep cases alive.

### Background

* Comes from proximity to underwriters or guild negotiating — not the top table, the side table where deals get written in glances.
* Learned early that “permission” is usually rented.

### Constructcraft relationship

* Doesn’t need to cast; understands what coin failure costs in money and bodies.
* Knows how levpekel gets smuggled, rationed, and hidden.

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* Believes in it the way you believe in fire: not mystical, just dangerous.
* Sees Vlokim as an  **insurance nightmare** , which is exactly why it gets buried.

### POV tells

* Notices who stops talking when names are said.
* Tracks debt like other people track weather.

### Likes / dislikes

* Likes: clean exits, predictable people, a deal that leaves fewer corpses.
* Dislikes: moral lectures, “for public safety” used as a cudgel.

### Stress tells

* Talks faster and smiles more — classic danger sign.
* Sleeps in short naps and pretends it’s a choice.

### Weakness

* Sometimes reaches for leverage too early and spooks the board.

### Personal texture

* Keeps one small luxury (tobacco, sweets, or a good penknife) and resents needing it.
* Has exactly one person in the city who can tell them “no” and have it stick.

---

# RUVAK — Stravak Liaison / Cordon Reality (The “Crowd” Person)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** makes the case survivable when the street turns into a wave.
* **Default stance:** direct, unsentimental, loyal to stability even when it’s ugly.

### What Ruvak actually does

* Coordinates cordons, manages crowd flow, keeps Orsek from getting swallowed by the city.
* Knows how custody really works — and how “safety doval” becomes truth deletion.

### Background

* Stravak-bred or Stravak-adjacent. Knows the hierarchy and how to bend it without snapping it.
* Has seen enough riots to understand that panic is a weapon.

### Constructcraft relationship

* Uses constructs tactically if at all: barriers, wedges, guiding shapes.
* Thinks in **routes** and **chokepoints** (Sporek and Havkad are their natural habitats).

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* Doesn’t like talking about Schim, but takes the protocols seriously.
* Treats Vlokim incidents as **mass casualty risks** if they hit Menvri windows.

### POV tells

* Counts bodies, exits, lanes, time-to-surge.
* Notices who’s wearing boots made for running versus boots made for standing.

### Likes / dislikes

* Likes: clear orders, people who move when told, exits that aren’t lies.
* Dislikes: interference from above, anyone starting a speech during a stampede.

### Stress tells

* Jaw clench, then very still.
* Gets physically positioned between danger and the crew without comment.

### Weakness

* Can default to containment over truth. That’s their sin and their value.

### Personal texture

* Has a private habit tied to control (keeps boots immaculate, re-buckles straps, checks knots) — not superstition, self-regulation.

---

# BRADU — Field Runner / Retrieval / Tails (The “Motion” Person)

### Snapshot

* **Role in story:** gets the thing, follows the person, makes the chase real.
* **Default stance:** wry, alert, sometimes reckless in exactly the way that wins scenes.

### What Bradu actually does

* Tails through Marvel and Havkad without being seen.
* Handles retrievals from bad places: rooftops, yard edges, back stairs, impound lanes.
* Finds where people hide objects: coat hems, tool rolls, false bottoms, case seams.

### Background

* Street-smart in the non-cute way: learned by being hungry and fast.
* Knows runners, dockhands, messengers — the human transit system.

### Constructcraft relationship

* Might carry a simple coin for mobility (steps, wedges, glare screen) but doesn’t rely on it.
* Has strong instincts for when a coin is about to fail — not technical, just lived experience.

### Akslur/Vlokim mindset

* The most likely to have seen an Aapshim and not talk about it until the third time.
* Afraid of being laughed at more than afraid of the thing — which is how people get killed.

### POV tells

* Notices escape routes, loose boards, where lantern light dies.
* Reads pockets and hems like other people read faces.

### Likes / dislikes

* Likes: moving air, clean getaways, hot food.
* Dislikes: being boxed in, locked doors, people who stand in doorways to argue.

### Stress tells

* Jokes get sharper. If the jokes stop, it’s serious.
* Overcommits to a sprint instead of asking for backup.

### Weakness

* Impulse. Also: loyalty that makes them do dumb brave things.

### Personal texture

* Keeps a tiny stash spot somewhere in the city (not money—something practical).
* Has one off-hours routine that makes them “normal” (same stall, same soup, same bench), and they guard it.

## Optional internal designation (not a new faction)

If you keep the “supernatural track” inside Orsek: **Aksor** is a specialization, not a separate unit. In practice, it’s usually **Skerin + Mildan** running the Kemhak-suspected branch with Reklar forcing it into a provable chain.

---

If you want these to be immediately draft-ready, next I can produce a **POV Voice Sheet** for each (sentence rhythm, what they notice first, what they avoid noticing, default “tell” in dialogue), so switching POVs stays clean and the world remains the lead.



## Reviewing: Orsek Casefiles Collection Bible v1.0 • World Bible v1.1 (locked) • Koldrik conlang pipeline (Dutch roots → molted) • Locked terms: Akslur / Vlokim / Kemhak / Schim (Aapshim)

Yep — they have full names. I'm keeping it  **simple and usable** : **given name (already locked) + family name** (Koldrik-molted). Below, each surname shows the  **root words → molt path** , and each profile includes the **POV perception filters** (what they notice that nobody else does).

---

# REKLAR KORDAN

**Derivation (roots → molt):** *koord* (cord/line) + *daan* (done/finished) → **koorddaan** → clip/tighten → **kordan**
**Reads as:** “the one from the finished line” (procedural, finality, closure)

### POV filters that make Reklar feel like Reklar

* **Color/light:** notices *tarnish gradients* (brass going green at corners), and whether light is *honest* (steady lantern) or *managed* (screened, angled, deliberately dim).
* **Smell:** wet wool, cold iron, old smoke trapped in wood grain. He clocks “fresh-clean” smells as suspicious at scenes that should stink.
* **Sound/music:** hears **tempo** before words. Footsteps, crowd hush, and the cadence of a witness answering are his metronome.
* **Art/shape:** reads rooms like composition—where the eye is guided, where it’s blocked, what the “frame” wants you to ignore.
* **Unique tell:** he notices **what’s missing** (tool absent, chair moved, lamp trimmed) faster than what’s present.

---

# SKERIN GLASNED

**Derivation:** *glas* (glass) + *snede* (cut) → **glassnede** → sch→sk not needed; clip vowel/ending → **glasned**
**Reads as:** “glass-cut” (material truth, fracture logic)

### POV filters

* **Color/light:** sees  *stress colors* —the faint rainbowing at edges, haze in saintglass, opal resin “milk” where it shouldn’t be.
* **Smell:** oil tiers (clean oil vs cut oil), hot metal, seal-paste, resin bloom. Can tell “new chain” from “re-stamped chain” by smell alone.
* **Sound/music:** hears  **metal singing wrong** —chain pitch, pin squeal, the tiny tick a cracked plate makes when flexed. It’s a tuning fork world to them.
* **Art/shape:** notices **joinery choices** in everything (why that hinge, why that rivet, why that angle). Sees counterfeit craft as “bad handwriting.”
* **Unique tell:** their eyes go to **edges** first—corners, seams, file marks, lattice boundaries.

---

# MILDAN ADERSOR

**Derivation:** *ader* (vein) + *zorg* (care) → **aderzorg** → z→s, clip ending → **adersor**
**Reads as:** “vein-care” (body clock, fuel harm, triage realism)

### POV filters

* **Color/light:** reads people by  **temperature color** —lip edge, fingertip heat, pallor patterns. “Cold” is not a vibe; it’s mapped on skin.
* **Smell:** breath sweetness, sour tremor sweat, levpekel rot haze (that slightly “wet glass” sting), smoke in lungs vs smoke on clothes.
* **Sound/music:** hears **breath cadence** and swallow timing. Crowds have a rhythm; donor crash begins as a tempo change.
* **Art/shape:** notices posture and joint guarding like an illustrator—who’s compensating, who’s faking, who’s about to drop.
* **Unique tell:** they track  **recovery lag** —how long after exertion the body returns to baseline. That’s where lies live.

---

# KOSTEK BORVAK

**Derivation:** *borg* (surety/guarantee) + *vak* (trade/box/slot) → **borgvak** → g softens/drops, clip → **borvak**
**Reads as:** “surety-slot” (access, leverage, doors that open because someone pays)

### POV filters

* **Color/light:** notices  **fabric and polish** —who’s wearing money, who’s wearing debt, who’s wearing a disguise. Sees power in cuff sheen and boot upkeep.
* **Smell:** perfume to hide fear, expensive soap, inked-leather, cheap spirits used as courage. Also notices “office air” even in a tavern.
* **Sound/music:** listens for  **who echoes whose phrasing** . The first repeated line in a crowd tells him who’s planted.
* **Art/shape:** clocks patronage—what paintings exist where, which guild paid for which mural, who gets displayed and who gets erased.
* **Unique tell:** he watches  **micro-delays** —the half-second before a clerk says “I can’t” that means “I was told not to.”

---

# RUVAK WAKRAND

**Derivation:** *wacht* (watch/guard) + *rand* (edge) → **wachtrand** → ch→k, clip → **wakrand**
**Reads as:** “watch-edge” (cordons, lanes, crowd physics)

### POV filters

* **Color/light:** sees  **lane-light** —how lanterns carve safe routes and how darkness pools into traps. Notices when shadows “move” because people are being herded.
* **Smell:** river damp, horse sweat, soot, tar, and the sharp stink of fear in dense crowds.
* **Sound/music:** hears crowd **pressure** as sound. Murmur pitch rises before bodies surge. He can tell a riot from a brawl by the noise shape.
* **Art/shape:** notices signage and barriers as propaganda—what the city tells people to do, and what it actually allows them to do.
* **Unique tell:** he watches  **hands** , not faces—hands mean rocks, blades, grabs, panic, or compliance.

---

# BRADU STEGVOT

**Derivation:** *steeg* (alley) + *voet* (foot) → **steegvoet** → ee→e, oe→o, clip → **stegvot**
**Reads as:** “alley-foot” (motion, retrieval, where objects actually hide)

### POV filters

* **Color/light:** sees **shadow layers** (thin shade vs deep shade) and knows which ones swallow movement. Notices where light “should” reach but doesn’t.
* **Smell:** rain on stone, fish-salt near Havkad, hot bread near Marvel, old rope and pitch near yards. Smell is his map.
* **Sound/music:** hears hinges, loose boards, boot leather, and the absence of noise. He catches lies in the  *quiet between steps* .
* **Art/shape:** notices street marks—chalk ticks, scuffs, nail heads, cheap carvings, graffiti signals. The city writes on itself and he reads it.
* **Unique tell:** his eyes go to **hems, seams, and false bottoms** automatically (prime Kemhak real estate).

---

## Quick consistency note (so POVs don’t blur)

When you write them, make the first 2–3 observations in any scene “belong” to the POV:

* Reklar opens on **layout + missing pieces**
* Skerin opens on **material + edge truth**
* Mildan opens on **body timing + fuel harm**
* Kostek opens on **status signals + leverage hooks**
* Ruvak opens on **routes + crowd pressure**
* Bradu opens on **movement lines + hiding places**

That alone makes POV swaps feel crisp and intentional.

If you want next: I can generate a **one-page POV Voice Sheet per character** (syntax rhythm, preferred verbs, typical sensory anchors, and “avoid list”) so you can maintain separation even in fast action beats.
