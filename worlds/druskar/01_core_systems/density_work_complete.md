## Core Concept

Density work comes in **three layers**. **Not everyone has access.**

Unlike Fortune (which everyone has) and ossirs (which everyone carries), density talent is specialized:
- **Innate** density talent is rare
- **Rigcraft** requires training and carries body cost
- **Devices** require paired couplers and chronomass

This is where you avoid the Ant-Man clone problem by making it about **conservation, coupling, and failure states**.

---

## Layer 1: Innate Density Talent

The **cap, flow, strain** model. **Does NOT require Chronomass**—this is a body-cost system.

### Three Parameters

| Parameter | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cap** | How much mass offset you can safely hold |
| **Flow** | How fast you can move mass into or out of that offset |
| **Strain** | Damage accumulation from fast shifts or hard extremes |

This version can do dramatic feats, but it carries the **nastiest failure states** if you push it.

### Safe Behavior (Moderate Ranges)

At moderate ranges, it plays like **grounded physics**:

- Anchor (resist knockback)
- Hit harder
- Reduce momentum damage
- Change traction
- Absorb impact

### Failure Behavior (Pushed Too Far)

If you go too far, **the body pays**:

| Failure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Microfractures** | Bone stress from density mismatch |
| **Tendon shear** | Soft tissue can't handle the load |
| **Joint collapse** | Structural failure at articulation points |
| **Circulation issues** | Blood doesn't flow right in shifted tissue |
| **Lethal vulnerability mid-shift** | Caught between states = catastrophic |

**This answers the "wouldn't that crush my arm" concern.** Yes, unless the talent is trained AND you respect flow limits. Even then, it's brutal. That brutality keeps it noir instead of superhero.

## Layer 2: Rigcraft Density

Rigcraft is the **specific** version. **Does NOT require Chronomass**—this is internal redistribution with immediate body cost.

### What Rigcraft Does

- Does **NOT** change your total mass
- Does **NOT** change volume
- **Redistributes mass within the body**

Example: Lighten left arm, densify right arm.

### The Immediate Cost

You pay for redistribution **immediately**:

- Destabilize posture and gait
- Overload one side's bones, joints, and tendons
- Introduce **shear risk** if you take an impact mid-transfer

### Good For

| Use | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Contact moments | Not sustained modes |
| Grapples | Momentary advantage |
| Braces | Brief structural support |
| Short strikes | Impact enhancement |
| Climbing | Load distribution |
| Balance | Center of mass manipulation |
| Load shifting | Carrying/handling |

### Not Good For

| Use | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Running fights | Can't maintain redistribution while moving fast |
| Prolonged heavy state | Strain accumulates |
| Taking bullets while shifting | Mid-transfer vulnerability |

## Layer 3: Density Devices (Paired Couplers)

The **paired-coupler design** for non-innates. **Chronomass-driven.**

### Fundamental Rules

- Devices come in **pairs**
- Only work on **non-living targets**
- Do **NOT** conjure mass or volume from nowhere
- **Transfer** properties between two coupled objects
- **Spoiled Chronomass is especially dangerous** in paired transfer modes—creates bad seating and recoil events

This is how you get the bat-and-pillar idea. You don't "shrink the pillar into a bat." You couple bat and pillar and transfer a property at the right time.

## Device Mode Suite

### Mode I: Mass Transfer

**Volume stays constant. Mass transfers.**

- Changes density and weight
- Bat becomes heavy, pillar becomes light
- Size unchanged

### Mode II: Volume Transfer

**Mass stays constant. Volume transfers.**

- Changes size but not weight
- A plank grows longer but becomes less dense and more fragile
- The donor object shrinks and becomes denser

### Mode III: Mass + Volume Transfer

**Full property swap.** The "steal a little of both" mode.

- Make a small thing hit like a big thing without keeping it heavy for long
- Spike both mass and size briefly, then reverse
- Most versatile, most complex

### Mode IV: Timed Impulse

**High-flow momentary transfer** designed for impact timing.

- The "intelligent usage" mode
- Rewards skill
- Punishes panic
- Requires precise timing

### Mode V: Volume Only

**Size changes without weight change for each object.**

Practically: Mode II performed without swapping mass.

- Density changes **radically**
- Failure risk **spikes**
- Snaps wood
- Crumbles cheap stone
- Makes metal go weird if pushed

**Mode V is the "utility hack" mode, not the "safe fight" mode.**

## Device Costs and Failure States

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Coupling requirements** | Clean contact and stable seating required |
| **High-flow chronomass burn** | Fuel consumption spikes with fast transfers |
| **Mis-timing consequences** | Recoil events, shattered brittle materials |
| **Heat signature** | **LOUD**—device use is socially dangerous |

This keeps devices strong but not free, and makes them cinematic.

---

## Interaction with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fortune** | Can tilt contact timing; can't change physics |
| **Time** | Density-shifted mass behaves normally in time envelope (conservation applies) |
| **Ossirs** | Detect density work as pattern distortion |
| **Chronomass** | High-flow transfers burn hard |

---

## Forensic Tells

Density work leaves traces:

- Chronomass residue at coupling sites
- Material stress patterns (micro-deformation)
- Heat signature from device use
- Strain indicators on practitioners (for innate/rigcraft)
- Coupled object resonance patterns

## Story Applications

### Density as Physics Puzzle

- Route geometry becomes advantage
- Momentum matters
- Contact moments are decisive
- Preparation beats improvisation

### Density as Body Horror

- The failure states are visceral
- Pushing limits has real consequences
- Training is survival, not montage
- Mid-shift vulnerability creates tension

### Density as Social Signal

- Device Heat is loud
- Using density work publicly marks you
- Professional use vs. street use distinction
- Legal vs. grey market devices

## Quick Reference

**Density = physics leverage through mass/volume manipulation**

**Three Layers:**

1. **Innate (Cap/Flow/Strain)**
   - Change own mass offset
   - Failure states: microfractures, tendon shear, joint collapse
   - Training matters

2. **Rigcraft (Redistribution)**
   - Move mass within body, total unchanged
   - Good for: contact moments, grapples, strikes
   - Bad for: running fights, sustained use

3. **Devices (Paired Couplers)**
   - Non-living targets only
   - Five modes (Mass, Volume, Both, Impulse, Volume-Only)
   - Requires coupling, burns chronomass, loud Heat

**Key principle:** Conservation always applies. You don't create mass or volume—you move it.
