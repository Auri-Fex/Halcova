# TECHNOLOGY BASELINE — Non-Magical Tech Level

## Core Principle

**Firearms baseline.** Revolvers and carbines are normal. This is not a medieval world with magic bolted on—it's an industrial world where magic has been industrialized alongside everything else.

---

## Firearms

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Revolvers** | Common | Standard personal defense |
| **Carbines** | Common | Standard long arm |
| **Rifles** | Available | Military and specialist use |
| **Shotguns** | Available | Close quarters; boarding |

**Ammunition:** Cartridge-based; brass common
**Reliability:** Good in dry conditions; canal humidity is a maintenance factor

---

## Transportation

### Water (Primary)
| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Canal barges** | Bulk cargo; towed or sailed |
| **Lock-runners** | Fast small craft for urgent delivery |
| **Quay boats** | Harbor work; loading/unloading |
| **Towbeasts** | Animal power for barge towing |

### Land (Limited)
| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Carts** | Short-haul; roads rot quickly |
| **Pack animals** | Where carts can't go |
| **Foot travel** | Most common for personnel |

**Key Point:** Roads rot on the cold shelf. Canals are infrastructure because they're the only reliable transport.

---

## Communication

| Method | Speed | Security |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Signal boards** | Instant (local) | Public posting |
| **Couriers** | Hours to days | Seal-dependent |
| **Tick beacons** | Instant (local) | Time reference only |

**No radio.** Communication is physical—posted slips, carried messages, signal flags.

---

## Lighting

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Lanterns** | General lighting; assay lanterns for chronomass |
| **Wick heaters** | Domestic heating |
| **Ledger lamps** | Time-stamped proof |

**Power:** Oil and endemic fuel sources; no electricity in the modern sense

---

## Manufacturing

| Level | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Metalwork** | Firearms, locks, gates, devices |
| **Glasswork** | Vials, lanterns, gauges |
| **Resinwork** | Seals (endemic-biological) |
| **Textile** | Rope, canvas, clothing |
| **Clockwork** | Timing devices, meters |

**Industrial capacity:** Equivalent to late 19th century in metalwork and precision manufacturing

---

## Medicine

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Surgery** | Competent; anesthesia available |
| **Infection control** | Understood; endemic biota complicates |
| **Chronic conditions** | Managed, not cured |
| **Magical healing** | Not standard; chronomass has medical applications |

---

## Construction

| Type | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Stone** | Locks, gates, foundations |
| **Brick** | Buildings, warehouses |
| **Timber** | Scaffolding, temporary structures |
| **Metal** | Reinforcement, mechanisms |

**Canal infrastructure:** Sophisticated; centuries of development

---

## What Doesn't Exist

| Absent | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Electricity** | No lights, no motors, no communication |
| **Internal combustion** | No cars, no trucks, no aircraft |
| **Radio** | No instant long-distance communication |
| **Plastics** | Natural materials only |
| **Mass printing** | Documents are valuable |

---

## Technology + Magic Integration

| Mundane Tech | Magic Enhancement |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Clocks** | Chronomass anchoring/measuring |
| **Scales** | Density verification |
| **Lanterns** | Assay readings |
| **Seals** | Endemic resin behavior |
| **Firearms** | Chronomass-enhanced rare; mostly mundane |

**Key Point:** Magic enhances infrastructure more than combat. Most people interact with magic through bureaucracy, not battle.
