# FORENSICS REFERENCE — What Investigators Actually Use

## Core Principle

**Proof over names.** Accusations mean nothing. Evidence means everything. Contracts pay out based on documented proof, not reputation or accusation.

## ODDSWORK Forensics

| Evidence Type | What It Shows | Collection Method |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Heat clustering** | Geographic concentration of improbable outcomes | Pattern mapping |
| **Streak signatures** | Fortune spending around queues/schedules/auctions | Statistical analysis |
| **Claim timing correlations** | Coordinated Fortune use | Event correlation |
| **Wager records** | Fortune earning attempts | Registry pulls |

**Investigation Pattern:**
1. Map improbable outcomes geographically
2. Identify individuals present at multiple sites
3. Cross-reference wager records
4. Document streak patterns around economic events
5. Wait for Claim settlement clustering to confirm

## Chronomass (Time) Forensics

| Evidence Type | What It Shows | Collection Method |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Assay residue** | Recent chronomass use | Lantern read |
| **Vent bloom scars** | Improper venting; lot quality issues | Visual inspection |
| **Mantle wear patterns** | Sync mantle usage history | Equipment examination |
| **Gate-log impossibilities** | Travel times that violate physics | Log comparison |

**Investigation Pattern:**
1. Pull gate logs for target period
2. Identify travel time impossibilities
3. Assay residue at entry/exit points
4. Check mantle service records
5. Cross-reference lot custody chains

## Density Device Forensics

| Evidence Type | What It Shows | Collection Method |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Clamp scorch** | Transfer Mate use location | Visual inspection |
| **Seam dust** | Bulk transfer boundary | Particulate collection |
| **Oscillation scars** | Unstable density cycling | Structural analysis |
| **Donor/receiver geometry tells** | Property mismatch | Measurement comparison |

**Investigation Pattern:**
1. Identify objects with property anomalies
2. Check for clamp scorch marks
3. Collect and analyze seam dust
4. Measure density vs. expected values
5. Trace Transfer Mate certification records

## Rigcraft Forensics

| Evidence Type | What It Shows | Collection Method |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Joint/tendon trauma signatures** | Density Rigcraft abuse | Medical examination |
| **Vent handling mistakes** | Improper chronomass management | Residue patterns |
| **Plate mismatches** | Equipment tampering | Serial verification |
| **Internal damage patterns** | Strain limit violations | Imaging |

## Biota Forensics

| Evidence Type | What It Shows | Source |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Bloom film** | March exposure; potential contamination | Surface sampling |
| **Resin fracture geometry** | Seal House authenticity | Microscopy |
| **Chain chalk layers** | Chainsnail infestation timeline | Layer analysis |
| **"Dirty clean" assay contradictions** | Contamination cover-up | Multiple assay comparison |

---

## Standard Evidence Chain

1. **Collection** — Documented by collector identity and tick
2. **Sealing** — Custody seal applied (House-specific)
3. **Transport** — Logged movement with tick stamps
4. **Storage** — Bonded evidence facility
5. **Presentation** — Seal integrity verified before use

**Chain Break = Evidence Inadmissible**

## Common Fraud Patterns

| Fraud Type | Tell | Counter |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Plate swap** | Serial mismatch; wear inconsistency | Registry verification |
| **Partial restamp** | Ink depth variation; alignment error | Magnification |
| **Forged permit class** | Dot-string routing error | Route compass check |
| **Grade falsification** | Multiple assay reads don't match | Independent re-assay |
| **Seal counterfeiting** | Fracture geometry wrong | Lantern raking |

---

## Professional Investigator Roles

| Role | Specialty |
|------|-----------|
| **Contract Marshal** | Order Company evidence specialist |
| **Quarantine Warden** | Biota and contamination forensics |
| **Assay Burner** | Chronomass grade verification |
| **Seal Clerk** | Admissibility and tampering detection |
| **Heat Tracker** | Oddswork pattern analysis |

## Story Applications

- Investigation as plot driver (following evidence trail)
- Evidence planting as antagonist tactic
- Chain-of-custody drama (protecting or breaking the chain)
- Forensic specialist as character type
- "Proof over names" as thematic element
