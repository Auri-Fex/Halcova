## Core Definition

**Fortune in one sentence:**

Fortune is a personal budget of probability leverage that you spend to tilt outcomes. You refill it by wagering on events you do not control. If you lack sufficient balance for the outcome you want, your ossir can seat a debt-backed spend at a higher cost than ordinary wagering and log the obligation for later collection.

---

## The Universal Layer

Fortune is the universal layer. **EVERYONE has access.** This is the common state of the world—like everyone having an ossir.

Not everyone has the same ceiling or skill, but everyone can:
- Spend Fortune (bends and claims)
- Gain Fortune through wagering
- Accumulate Heat, Drift, and Claims

**Fortune is NOT powered by Chronomass.** It is powered by your personal fortune budget and your wager rules.

Chronomass intersects Fortune in two places:
1. **As a commodity** people wager on and steal
2. **As a Heat amplifier**—Fortune use around Chronomass is more likely to attract consequences

This is the layer that makes the noir engine work: rational, terrifying, with no person to plead with—only the accounting.

**Compare to Time and Density:** Those abilities are rare/specialized. Fortune is not. Everyone plays the Fortune game whether they want to or not.

## Two Spend Styles

### Bend

- A **small nudge**
- You do not announce it
- It **looks like luck**
- Plausibly deniable

### Claim

- A **larger shove**
- More **legible to the world**
- Tends to leave a **collectable wake**
- Creates debt that wants to resolve

### Insufficient Funds (Debt-Backed Spend)

When you cannot afford a bend or claim, your ossir can broker a debt-backed spend:

- Ossir offers terms to seat the outcome now and log an obligation
- The effective “vig” is higher than earning Fortune through normal wagering
- The obligation enters the collection pipeline like any other claim-shaped spend
- Third parties can legally satisfy the obligation and assume your debt (see Debt Transfer)

---

## Gaining Fortune

You gain Fortune by **wagering on events outside your control**.

This design prevents "infinite grind"—if you could farm Fortune by choosing outcomes you can influence, the system breaks.

### Three Levers

| Lever | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stake** | What you risk |
| **Odds** | What you accept |
| **Resolution clarity** | How clean the event resolves |

**The world rewards:**
- Real uncertainty
- Real risk
- Clean resolution

### Collateralized Wagers

You may also wager collateral (time, labor, property) directly with your ossir. If you lose, the collateral becomes a logged obligation eligible for collection or transfer.

---

## Costs and Guardrails

### Heat

The residue of using Fortune.

Heat makes your work:
- Easier to **read**
- Easier to **track**
- Easier to **punish**

### Drift

A subtle bias that accumulates when you keep bending reality in the same direction.

- Drift makes future bends **in that direction cheaper**
- Drift makes **everything else harder**
- Drift is how people become "lucky" in one domain and **cursed in another**

### Collection

Claims that are big enough **want to settle**.

The settlement can be:
- Mundane misfortune
- That suddenly seems inevitable
- At the worst possible moment

**This is where the noir lives.** The universe isn't malicious—it's just accounting. And the books always balance.

---

## Claims — Deep Specification

### What A Claim IS

A **claim** is a **formalized Fortune spend** that creates a **recognizable obligation** in the metaphysical accounting layer.

- **Bend:** "I nudge odds and hope nobody notices."
- **Claim:** "I take a result large enough that the world can index it."

**Key property:** A claim is **trackable** and **collectible**. It leaves a signature that persists.

Claims are closer to **a secured transaction** than a curse. You borrow outcome from uncertainty and post yourself as collateral.

### Implementation (Internal, Not Theatrical)

A person implements a claim by performing a Fortune spend past a threshold.

**Two triggers:**

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Magnitude threshold** | Probability shift too large to smooth into background variance |
| **Specificity threshold** | Fortune bound to very specific outcome instead of general nudge |

Experienced people feel the difference. Ossirs hear it clearly.

**Speaking is optional:** Some people speak a short phrase as habit because it helps focus, makes the act psychologically real, and functions as a personal receipt. The phrase is not magic—it's ritualized interface.

### Claim Structure (Six Fields)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subject** | Who is bound (usually claimant, sometimes also beneficiary) |
| **Scope** | How big and how wide the outcome distortion |
| **Vector** | What kind of uncertainty borrowed (timing, encounter, mechanical failure, attention) |
| **Anchor** | Handle that makes it collectible (person, place, habit, object, **route**) |
| **Maturity** | When it wants to settle (quick or dragged for weeks) |
| **Signature** | Residue pattern (what ossirs and tuned instruments detect) |

**Note:** Routes make good anchors. This is why "routes are keys" is powerful.

### Claim Lifecycle (Three Phases)

**Phase 1: Seating**
- Claim seats into local probability landscape
- Chaotic/uncertain situations = easier seating
- Sterile/controlled situations = harder seating, louder residue

**Phase 2: Drift and Reinforcement**
- After seating, the world biases around you
- Unusually good luck in claimed direction
- Unusually bad luck in adjacent domains
- This is mechanical, not cosmic malice. Statistical tilt.

**Phase 3: Collection**
- Eventually the claim resolves into a collection event

**Three collection shapes:**

| Shape | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct reversal** | Same domain pays back | Claimed safety in chase → later trip on normal stair, break ribs |
| **Substitution** | Debt transfers to someone connected | Claimed shot lands → friend takes random hit that should have missed |
| **Constraint tightening** | Options narrow until paid | Claimed clean escape → doors that should be open are shut, friction accumulates |

**The world does not punish. It closes books.**

### Debt Transfer and Interception

Logged obligations can be satisfied by third parties who then hold your debt under civil terms:

- A House, guild, or individual may “step in front of” collection and settle it
- Once settled, they hold a contract right to collect from you (labor, coin, terms)
- Predatory actors inflate, extend, or obscure terms to prevent payoff

### Clean vs Dirty Claims

| Type | Seats in | Wording | Settles | Residue | Result |
|------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Clean** | High uncertainty | Broad | Quickly, locally | Light | Hard to track |
| **Dirty** | Controlled conditions | Highly specific | Stretched over time | Loud | Easy to hunt |

**Dirty claims are how people get tracked and killed.**

### Claim Visibility (Who Sees What)

| Observer | What They Detect |
|----------|------------------|
| **Normal people** | Infer from behavior and coincidence patterns |
| **Ossirs** | Seating, hook signature, rising collection pressure |
| **Tuned instruments** | Claim residue, can record it |
| **Skilled opponents** | Statistical footprint; can force you into low-uncertainty environments |

### Claim Tactics

**How Protagonists Use Claims Fairly:**
- Use for pivotal windows, not routine success
- Use for "permission to act," not "I win"
- Guard looks away (fair) vs. entire patrol disappears (unfair)
- Single shot lands (fair) vs. every enemy misses (unfair)

**How Antagonists Counter Claims:**
1. Force controlled spaces — claims seat harder, become dirty
2. Reduce uncertainty with discipline — fewer seating opportunities
3. Add noise and decoys — claim anchors to wrong thing
4. Track residue — ossirs, tuned plates
5. Create moral hazard — bait repeated claims, let collection hit when weak
 6. Intercept debts — convert logged obligations into exploitable contracts

### Claims + Time/Density Interaction

Claims do **not directly power** Time or Density. They **bias the probability of outcomes** within those domains.

| System | Claim Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **Time** | "Claim my Blink window coincides with a gap in attention" |
| **Density** | "Claim the coupler seats cleanly on impact" |
| **Device timing** | "Claim the transfer impulse hits at exact instant target commits weight" |

**Claims grease precision.**

### The Scariest Part

Claims create **endogenous risk**. Every time you choose to be "lucky," you also choose to become a more legible object in the city's accounting layer. It is a self-generated pursuit signal.

That is why this feels **rational and terrifying** without needing gods.

## Fortune Uses (Plausibly Deniable)

Fortune is strongest when it stays **plausibly deniable**:

| Use | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Thread a shot through moving bodies | Without "aimbot" vibes |
| Make a guard look away | At the wrong second |
| Find the one board that doesn't creak | When silence matters |
| Misplace a key on someone else's belt | Opportunity creation |
| Get a clean jam | At the worst moment for your opponent |

Fortune does NOT:
- Replace skill
- Replace physics
- Grant superpowers
- Make you invincible

Fortune DOES:
- Create windows
- Tilt close calls
- Punish enemies at inconvenient moments
- Make the unlikely happen

---

## Interaction with Other Systems

| System | Fortune's Role |
|--------|---------------|
| **Time** | Fortune can tilt whether you get the window you need |
| **Density** | Fortune can make contact happen at the right moment |
| **Ossirs** | Ossirs sense when Fortune use is leaving a Claim-shaped wake |

---

## Forensic Tells

Fortune use is detectable through:

- Heat signature residue
- Pattern analysis (too many "lucky" outcomes)
- Claim sensing (ossirs, specialized training)
- Drift accumulation (observable behavioral skew)

---

## Story Applications

### Fortune as Character Reveal

- How characters wager shows what they value
- Drift patterns reveal hidden priorities
- Collection timing creates dramatic irony
- Risk tolerance defines personality

### Fortune as Plot Engine

- Debts accumulate across arcs
- Collections can be foreshadowed or surprising
- Drift creates predictable vulnerabilities
- Wagering creates scene tension

### Fortune as Thematic Core

- Luck is not free
- The universe is accounting, not chaos
- Every advantage creates a liability
- There is no one to plead with

---

## Thematic Role: Law vs Oath

**Fortune Claims are Oaths to the universe.**

When you seat a Claim, you post yourself as collateral. This is not a metaphor—it's the mechanics. The accounting layer logs the obligation, and the collection will find you.

| System Element | Thematic Mapping |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Fortune balance** | What you've earned through genuine risk |
| **Claim structure** | A sworn promise—you take now, you pay later |
| **Collection** | The universe enforcing the oath you made |
| **Debt Transfer** | Third parties assuming your obligations—contracts built on oaths |

**Why this matters for stories:**

- Claims are personal. You can't negotiate, can't appeal, can't plead. The books balance.
- Debt Transfer weaponizes this—someone else can buy your obligation and collect *their* way.
- The Law/Oath tension: Legal frameworks (Order Companies, contracts) are built on top of metaphysical oaths (Claims). Human bureaucracy rides the universe's enforcement.

**The absence of Hospitality:** In a world where debts transfer and collection is inevitable, there's no free help. Every favor you accept becomes a ledger entry somewhere.

---

## Quick Reference

**Fortune = probability budget spent to tilt outcomes**

**Gain:** Wager on events outside your control (stake + odds + resolution clarity)

**Spend:**
- Bend (small, deniable)
- Claim (large, leaves wake)

**Costs:**
- Heat (residue, trackable)
- Drift (directional bias accumulation)
- Collection (debts settle, badly)

**Best uses:** Plausibly deniable tilts, not superpowers
