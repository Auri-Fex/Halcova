# CHRONOMASS — Time Manipulation (Complete Reference)

## Core Concept

Chronomass is a **biological fuel** that enables time manipulation. It's harvested, processed, traded, and regulated like any industrial commodity—but one that lets users bend time.

---

## The Three Categories

### 1. SEATCRAFT (Innate)
**User Type:** Living user with inherent ability (a "Seat")
**Effect:** Generates local time-slow envelopes
**Control:** Full envelope control; can modulate size, intensity, duration

### 2. RIGCRAFT (Hybrid)
**User Type:** Non-Seat user with a living-driver harness ("Rig")
**Effect:** Limited envelope behavior through biological interface
**Control:** Constrained by Rig capacity and fuel state

### 3. CLOCKWORK (Devices)
**User Type:** Any operator
**Effect:** Measure, resist, anchor, screen, contain—but **cannot distort time**
**Control:** Device-dependent; passive or triggered

---

## Core Effects

### BLINK
**Definition:** Burst envelope enabling "impossible speed" along a real path.
**Important:** This is **not teleportation**. The user moves along a continuous path—just impossibly fast relative to observers.
**Tells:** Entry/exit residue; path disturbance; witness impossibilities

### STUDY (DWELL)
**Definition:** Skin-close dilation for learning, practice, or extended perception.
**Effect:** User experiences subjective time at a different rate than surroundings.
**Cost:** Chronomass burn; extended Dwell creates fatigue debt.

---

## Scaling (Nonlinear)

**Cost Formula:** Envelope size × duration × intensity
**Key Rule:** Costs **explode** at scale; residue strengthens with larger effects

| Scale | Cost | Residue |
|-------|------|---------|
| Personal | Manageable | Light |
| Room-sized | Expensive | Moderate |
| Building-sized | Ruinous | Heavy |
| Block-sized | Essentially impossible | Catastrophic |

## Reserve States

### Seat States
Full → ¾ → ½ → ¼ → Low → Empty

### Rig States
Fed → Sated → Thin → Dry → Starved → Venting

### Device States
Charged → Spent → Overheated → Breached

---

## Countermeasures

### SYNC MANTLE (Locked Countermeasure)
**Type:** Wearable chronomass metering harness
**Effect:** Keeps a non-caster **comparatively active** inside an enemy envelope
**Costs:** Constant burn, tremor/nausea, screenable
**Limitation:** Not absolute protection; reduces disadvantage rather than eliminating it

### Other Countermeasure Stack
- **Trip lattices:** Announce envelope events
- **Cadence pins:** Keep squads synced so Blink can't peel them cleanly
- **Anchor clocks:** Create fixed time reference points

---

## Chronomass Economy

### Source Channels
1. **Kronvar Belt (legal mainline):** Charter farms produce most **Set** lots
2. **Jitknal Labyrinth (grey):** Wild traps produce **Raw/Cut** lots; high residue risk
3. **Brinav March (seasonal):** Brackwater blooms create shock supply and counterfeit incentives

### Truth States
| State | Stability | Legality | Risk |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Raw** | Unstable | Quarantine-only | High |
| **Set** | Stable | Legal trade | Low |
| **Cut** | Variable | Street/illegal | Medium-High |

### Custody Path
**Bonded quay intake → assay/grading → registry release**
Skipping assay = seizure, quarantine, or "maintenance closure" that ruins you

---

## Forensic Detection

- **Assay residue:** Lantern reads detect recent chronomass use
- **Vent bloom scars:** Physical marks from improper venting
- **Mantle wear patterns:** Equipment degradation tells
- **Gate-log impossibilities:** Travel times that don't match physics

---

## Professional Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Blink Courier** | High-speed envelope delivery |
| **Rig Runner** | Non-Seat using Rigcraft professionally |
| **Mantled Marshal** | Enforcement with Sync Mantle training |
| **Assay Burner** | Tests and grades chronomass lots |
| **Meterwright** | Builds and maintains chronomass devices |

---

## Story Hooks

1. Rig running low at critical moment (state management drama)
2. Blink impossibility detected in gate logs (investigation)
3. Bad Set lot causing delayed failures
4. Mantle malfunction during envelope event
5. Wild chronomass trap gone wrong in Jitknal

## Thematic Role

**Chronomass embodies the Artifice vs Soul tension.**

| Category | Thematic Position |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Seatcraft (Innate)** | Soul—rare, personal, leaves heavy residue. Your authentic ability marks you. |
| **Rigcraft (Hybrid)** | The compromise—using devices to approximate what you weren't born with. |
| **Clockwork (Devices)** | Artifice—common, impersonal, safer. You operate tools, not yourself. |

**The world prefers Clockwork.** Devices are regulated, predictable, purchasable. Innate Seats are tracked, registered, suspected.

**Why this matters:** If you're born with Seatcraft, you carry a liability. Your soul is visible in ways device-users can hide. The system wants you documented, controlled, or working for someone who can afford your Heat signature.

**Story pressure point:** A character with innate ability can *always* do more than someone with devices—but they can never hide what they are.
