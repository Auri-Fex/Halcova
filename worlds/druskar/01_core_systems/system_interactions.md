## Design Principle

This is the part that makes the world feel **designed rather than piled**.

The three systems interact cleanly because each does something different:

| System | Role | Access |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Fortune** | The timing grease | **UNIVERSAL** — everyone has it |
| **Density** | The physics leverage | **RARE** — specialized talent or devices |
| **Time** | The turn-stealing layer | **RARE** — specialized talent or devices |

**Ossirs** are also universal—everyone carries one. They're the instrumentation layer that lets people navigate the Fortune economy and detect Time/Density use.

## Fortune: The Timing Grease

Fortune makes you **win the window**.

- It does NOT replace skill
- It does NOT replace physics
- It tilts close calls
- It makes unlikely moments happen
- It creates opportunity

**Fortune asks:** "Did you get lucky?"

---

## Density: The Physics Leverage

Density **changes momentum, traction, and impact**.

- It turns route geometry into advantage
- It makes contact moments decisive
- It rewards preparation and positioning

**Density asks:** "Can you use the physics?"

---

## Time: The Turn-Stealing Layer

Time **creates windows, denies agency, and rewards planning**.

- Devices exist to prevent it from becoming absolute
- It's the most powerful but most expensive
- It requires countermeasure awareness

**Time asks:** "Can you take the turn?"

## Interaction Rules

### Two-System Combinations (Clean)

You can usually combine two layers cleanly:

| Combination | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Fortune + Time** | Bend to get the window you need for Blink |
| **Fortune + Density** | Bend to make contact happen at the right moment |
| **Time + Density** | Blink to close distance, density-shifted strike on arrival |

### Three-System Combinations (Rare and Costly)

Combining all three in one beat should be:

- **Rare**
- **Costly**
- **Creates a signature the whole city can smell**

This is the "rule of cool" constraint. You CAN do it. The question is whether you can afford the Heat.

## Chronomass: The Device Fuel (Not Universal)

**Critical clarification:** Chronomass is NOT consumed by all three systems equally.

| System | Chronomass Role |
|--------|----------------|
| **Fortune** | **NOT powered by chronomass**—it's a commodity and Heat amplifier only |
| **Time (Innate)** | **NOT required**—Seatcraft talent doesn't need fuel |
| **Time (Devices)** | **Required**—mantles and rigs burn chronomass |
| **Density (Innate/Rigcraft)** | **NOT required**—body-cost system |
| **Density (Devices)** | **Required**—paired couplers burn chronomass |

This creates **different resource constraints** for different character types:
- Innate talents worry about body strain, not fuel
- Device users worry about chronomass supply and quality
- Fortune users worry about Claims, not fuel

---

## Heat: The Common Consequence

All three systems create Heat:

| System | Heat Character |
|--------|---------------|
| **Fortune** | Subtle, pattern-detectable, cumulative |
| **Time** | Obvious, signature-specific, physiologically trackable |
| **Density** | Loud, especially from devices, materially detectable |

This creates **forensic vulnerability**: use anything, leave traces.

---

## Ossirs: The Common Warning System

Ossirs detect distortion from all three systems:

| System | Ossir Detection |
|--------|----------------|
| **Fortune** | Claim-shaped wakes, consequence accumulation |
| **Time** | Pattern distortion from envelope deployment |
| **Density** | Pattern distortion from rigcraft and device use |

This creates **situational awareness**: a well-tuned ossir warns you about nearby system use.

## Tactical Implications

### The Prepared Fighter

- Has Fortune budget managed
- Has density capability (innate, rigcraft, or device)
- Has time countermeasures (device or awareness)
- Has ossir tuned and fed

### The Desperate Fighter

- Fortune budget depleted or Claimed
- Density pushing strain limits
- No time capability or countermeasure
- Ossir noisy or absent

### The Elite Fighter

- Deep Fortune reserves, clean of Drift
- Innate or refined density talent
- Seatcraft time capability OR excellent device
- Well-tuned ossir with known error modes

---

## Story Implications

### Power Isn't Linear

Having one system maxed doesn't make you unbeatable. The interaction space creates rock-paper-scissors dynamics:

- Time beats raw speed but loses to prepared countermeasures
- Density beats physics but loses to timing
- Fortune beats close calls but loses to overwhelming force

### Preparation Matters More Than Raw Power

The fighter who knows what's coming and has the right tools beats the fighter with more raw capability who's surprised.

### Every Advantage Creates Vulnerability

- Fortune use creates Claims
- Time use creates physiological debt and Heat
- Density use creates strain and signature
- All three together creates a beacon

## Scene Design Guidelines

When designing action scenes, ask:

1. **What's the Fortune situation?** (Budgets, Claims pending, Drift patterns)
2. **What's the Density situation?** (Capabilities, strain levels, devices available)
3. **What's the Time situation?** (Seatcraft present? Devices present? Countermeasures?)
4. **What are the ossirs saying?** (Clean? Noisy? Warning?)
5. **What's the Heat situation?** (Who's watching? Who cares?)

## Quick Reference

| System | Role | Ask |
|--------|------|-----|
| Fortune | Timing grease | "Did you get lucky?" |
| Density | Physics leverage | "Can you use the physics?" |
| Time | Turn-stealing | "Can you take the turn?" |

**Two systems = clean**
**Three systems = rare, costly, signature**

**Common currency:** Chronomass
**Common consequence:** Heat
**Common warning:** Ossirs
