## Core Concept

Time work is **rare**. It is the high-end layer. **Not everyone has access.**

Unlike Fortune (which everyone has) and ossirs (which everyone carries), time talent is specialized:
- **Seatcraft** is innate and uncommon
- **Rigcraft** requires black-market equipment and marginal talent
- **Clockwork** requires expensive devices

Time is the **turn-stealing layer**—it creates windows, denies agency, and rewards planning. Devices exist to prevent it from becoming absolute.

---

## Canon Locks (Non-Negotiable)

### No-Field Rule
**Dead matter cannot create time distortion.** If time bends, something living is doing it.

### Devices Cannot Originate
Devices can **manage exposure and participation**. They do **not originate** true time bending on their own.

### Chronomass Activation is Mechanical
Metering and feedback loops. **No spoken trigger required.**

---

## Ability Categories

### Seatcraft (Innate)

- A person can generate the effect because they are the **living driver**
- Rarest category
- Highest ceiling
- Natural talent, trainable but not grantable
- **Does NOT require carrying Chronomass**—the talent is innate

### Rigcraft (Black-Market Hybrids)

- A rig helps a **marginal talent do more**
- Or helps a time-capable person **do it cleaner**
- Grey/black market
- Higher risk, mixed legality
- **Chronomass-driven**—rigs need fuel

### Clockwork (Pure Device)

- **Cannot bend time by itself**
- Can keep someone **functional in the envelope**
- Can **countermeasure** timing tricks
- **Chronomass-driven**—mantles burn fuel
- This is why Blink isn't "I win"—devices let non-casters participate

---

## Core Abilities

### Blink

**Not teleport.** A burst of local time-slow around the user with a **distance and intensity budget**.

- Rewards **pathing and planning**, not anime movement
- You still have to physically move
- Environment still matters
- Witnesses see you blur

**Tactical reality:** Blink is powerful but not absolute. Time devices let non-casters remain active in your envelope, turning the fight into "who prepared better" instead of "who has Blink."

### Study (or Dwell)

**Skin-close personal dilation.** Lets someone learn, read, practice, or plan without affecting the room.

- Elegant "support power"
- Useful without being flashy
- Good for training, analysis, decision-making
- Personal scope only

---

## Costs (Nonlinear Scaling)

Time work scales **nonlinearly**. Bigger and colder costs **explode**.

### Cost Categories

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Chronomass consumption** | Fuel burned to maintain the effect (devices/rigs only—innate talent doesn't consume chronomass) |
| **Heat signature** | Detectable residue that can be tracked |
| **Physiological blowback** | Migraines, tremor, nausea, sensory lag, sleep debt |
| **Cognitive cost** | Impulsive or slow after heavy use |

### Time Sickness (Chronomass Exposure)

Chronomass exposure has an **unmistakable body signature**—physiological, not mystical:

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vertigo** | Comes in pulses |
| **Double hearing** | Delayed or echoed audio |
| **Visual afterimages** | Lag behind moving objects |
| **Tremor** | Fine motor control degradation |
| **Nausea/dry-mouth** | Standard toxic response |
| **Memory shear** | Can recount a sequence but lose the order experienced |

### Scaling Reality

- Small envelope, short duration = manageable
- Large envelope OR long duration = expensive
- Large envelope AND long duration = catastrophic
- Cold (slow time more) costs more than fast

---

## Time Devices

### What They Do

A time device allows a **non-time-caster to remain active** inside someone else's time envelope.

This is a **countermeasure**, not a "time gun."

### What They Are

A **participation permit** with costs:

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Chronomass burn | Fast consumption while active |
| Heat signature | **Obvious**—everyone knows you're using |
| Overheat/breach risk | Can fail catastrophically |

### Tactical Impact

Time devices turn Blink from "I win" into "I win **only if I also control the environment and the reads**."

A Blink user facing multiple device-equipped opponents has to plan, not just activate.

---

## Forensic Tells

Time work leaves traces:

- Chronomass residue patterns
- Heat signature mapping
- Physiological indicators on user (tremor, sensory lag)
- Witness reports of "blur" events
- Environmental micro-traces (disturbed dust patterns in frozen time)

---

## Interaction with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fortune** | Can tilt whether you get the window; can't create the window itself |
| **Density** | Density-shifted mass behaves interestingly in time envelope (conservation still applies) |
| **Ossirs** | Detect time work as pattern distortion; early warning system |
| **Chronomass** | Time work is the heaviest chronomass consumer |

---

## Story Applications

### Time Work as Power Hierarchy

- Seatcraft users are elite
- Rigcraft users are desperate or criminal
- Clockwork users are prepared professionals
- Having no time capability means relying on devices or allies

### Time Work as Tactical Puzzle

- Blink isn't a win button
- Envelope control matters
- Device countermeasures create fair fights
- Planning beats raw talent

### Time Work as Cost Engine

- Big moves have big prices
- Physiological debt accumulates
- You can't just spam your way through
- Recovery time is real

## Quick Reference

**Time work = rare, high-end, turn-stealing layer**

**Canon locks:**
- Dead matter can't create distortion (No-Field)
- Devices manage, don't originate
- Activation is mechanical (chronomass metering)

**Categories:**
- Seatcraft (innate, rare)
- Rigcraft (black-market hybrid)
- Clockwork (device, countermeasure)

**Abilities:**
- Blink (local time-slow, distance/intensity budget, NOT teleport)
- Study/Dwell (personal dilation for learning/planning)

**Costs (nonlinear):**
- Chronomass
- Heat
- Physiological blowback
- Cognitive debt

**Devices:** Participation permits, not time guns. Let non-casters stay active in envelope.
