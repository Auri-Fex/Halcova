# DENSITY — Mass/Volume Manipulation (Complete Reference)

## Core Concept

Density manipulation allows redistribution of mass and volume—but with strict limits that prevent "size superhero" nonsense. It's constrained, costly, and leaves evidence.

---

## The Three Categories

### 1. INNATE DENSITY (Rare)
**Model:** Cap/Flow/Strain
- **Cap:** Maximum density shift possible
- **Flow:** Rate of density change
- **Strain:** Accumulated damage from use

**Key Rule:** Biomechanics is real. Pushing the dial **injures you**.

### 2. DENSITY RIGCRAFT (Self-Only)
**Effect:** Redistributes mass through the body under Δ caps and gradient rules.
**Key Limit:** No net mass or volume change—just redistribution.

**Best Use Pattern:** Short pulses (contact windows)
- Harden for impact
- Soften for absorption
- Shift weight for leverage

**Failure Modes:**
- Torque tears
- Shear damage
- Oscillation injuries

### 3. TRANSFER MATES (Paired Devices)
**Definition:** Two matched clamps that couple two **non-living objects**.

**Critical Lock:** Mates **do not latch to living targets**.

## Transfer Mate Modes

### MODE M (Mass Transfer)
**Effect:** Swap mass between two objects
**Constraint:** Volumes remain fixed
**Result:** One object becomes denser, one becomes lighter

### MODE B (Bulk Transfer)
**Effect:** Transfer mass + volume together
**Constraint:** Receiver grows under jig/template constraint
**Risk:** Uncontrolled growth; structural instability

### MODE V (Volume Transfer)
**Effect:** Exchange packing/void space
**Constraint:** Mass remains fixed
**Result:** 
- Expanded object becomes weaker (more void)
- Compacted object becomes brittle (less void)

**Important:** This is packing/porosity manipulation, **not free strength**.

---

## Anti-Abuse Locks

1. **Mates do not latch to living targets** — No shrinking/growing people
2. **Mode V is packing/porosity, not "free strength"** — Compacted isn't stronger, just denser
3. **Rigcraft never changes volume** — Self-only, redistribution only
4. **Costs scale nonlinearly** — Big transfers cost disproportionately more
5. **All use leaves forensic evidence** — Scorch, seam dust, oscillation scars

## Costs

**Chronomass burn:** All Transfer Mate operations consume chronomass
**Heat vent:** Operations generate waste heat that must be managed
**Residue:** Forensic evidence accumulates on devices and targets

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Evidence |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Torque tears** | Rigcraft gradient exceeded | Internal tissue damage |
| **Shear damage** | Rapid density shift | Structural failure lines |
| **Oscillation scars** | Unstable density cycling | Wave-pattern damage |
| **Clamp scorch** | Mate overload | Burn marks on clamp contact points |
| **Seam dust** | Bulk transfer instability | Fine particulate at transfer boundary |

---

## Professional Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Rigweight Bruiser** | Combat use of density Rigcraft |
| **Mate Saboteur** | Transfer Mate specialist for industrial/criminal work |
| **Clampwright** | Builds and maintains Transfer Mates |
| **Jigwright** | Creates geometry constraints for Mode B operations |
| **Load Balancer** | Mode M specialist for crane/gate operations |

---

## Industrial Applications

**Legitimate Uses:**
- Crane load balancing (Mode M)
- Gate counterweighting
- Emergency barrier deployment (Mode V)
- Cargo density adjustment for shipping

**Grey/Criminal Uses:**
- Smuggling (density-adjusted hidden compartments)
- Sabotage (structural weakening via Mode V)
- Industrial espionage (equipment theft via Mode B miniaturization)

---

## Forensic Detection

- **Clamp scorch:** Burn marks at Transfer Mate contact points
- **Seam dust:** Fine particulate at transfer boundaries
- **Oscillation scars:** Wave-pattern damage from unstable cycling
- **Donor/receiver geometry tells:** Mismatch between apparent and actual properties
- **Residue patterns:** Chronomass residue specific to density operations

## Story Hooks

1. Transfer Mate sabotage causing infrastructure failure
2. Rigweight Bruiser pushing too hard, suffering internal damage
3. Mode V barrier failing at critical moment (known weakness)
4. Counterfeit goods detected via density anomaly
5. Jig failure causing uncontrolled Mode B growth
