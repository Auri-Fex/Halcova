## Core Definition

An ossir is a **bonded signal-organism** that sits between a person and the metaphysical "accounting layer" of Druskar. It does not cast. It does not generate Fortune. It **measures**, **classifies**, and **warns**.

**The key creative decision that makes them work:**
Ossirs are not emotion-readers. They are **instrumentation**.

**Universal presence:** In Druskar, everyone has an ossir—this is the common state, like everyone having Fortune access.

## Physical Description

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Size** | Fist-sized (typical) |
| **Shape** | Non-humanoid. More like a knot of membrane and gripping lobes than a little devil |
| **Key structure** | Ribbed membrane—not decoration, it's a resonator that couples to rider's bone and gear |
| **Communication** | Tones, harmonics, click trains—bone-conducted through collarbone, jaw, or wrist |

## What Ossirs Do (Four Jobs)

### 1. Detect Probability Curvature

When someone spends Fortune, reality "leans." Ossirs sense that lean as a shift in a background pattern.

### 2. Detect Claim Threads and Collection Risk

Big bends leave a wake that wants to settle later. Ossirs can tell "clean bend" from "claim-shaped bend."

### 3. Track Heat and Residue

Chronomass use, time devices, heavy density transfers all leave residue that behaves like a trail. Ossirs read it earlier than humans.

### 4. Compress Into Cues

They translate a high-dimensional mess into a small cue set your POV can act on fast—tones, harmonics, click trains.

---

## How They Work (The Mechanism)

Think of an ossir as a living combination of:
- **Tuning fork**
- **Seismograph**
- **Filter bank**

### The Physics

1. The world has a "baseline noise floor"—a stable pattern that is usually invisible
2. Fortune use, chronomass flow, time envelopes, and paired transfer seating create **pattern discontinuities**
3. The ossir's membrane resonates differently at those discontinuities
4. It produces **tone outputs** that are not speech—they're classifications

**This is why they feel rational and scary.** They're a bio-instrument that reacts to accounting and distortion.

## Bonding and Personalization

### Imprint

Ossirs calibrate to a specific rider's:
- Gait rhythm
- Respiration timing
- Habitual Fortune style (small bends versus claims)
- Typical Heat tolerance

**Two consequences:**
1. Your ossir becomes uniquely useful to you
2. Your ossir becomes less reliable if someone else tries to use it

### Variation Axes

Ossirs vary in three story-relevant ways:

| Axis | Variation |
|------|-----------|
| **Timbre profile** | Clean pitch with stacked harmonics / click trains / low jaw-hums |
| **Error mode** | Goes silent under stress / over-warns / misses slow threats but nails fast ones |
| **Sensitivity band** | Better at Fortune curvature / Heat trails / time smear |

This lets ossirs feel like people's tools AND liabilities, not universal cheat sensors.

## Ossirs and Fortune

### What They Can Detect

Four distinctions ossirs are good at:

| Detection | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Bend vs Claim** | Bend = smooth slope, tone stays stable. Claim = hooked ridge, tone wobbles then locks |
| **Clean bend vs messy bend** | Clean = local. Messy = splashes into other probabilities, wider wake |
| **Drift accumulation** | Persistent harmonic that doesn't fully return to baseline when someone keeps bending same direction |
| **Collection proximity** | The "hook" gets louder when a claim is about to settle |

### Can Ossirs Track Fortune Trails?

**Yes, but with limits that keep the world fair:**
- They can follow **Heat and claim residue** like scent on wind
- They **cannot** read intent or see the future
- They get confused in dense environments:
  - Busy works
  - Heavy chronomass traffic
  - Crowds spending small Fortune
  - Storms
  - Industrial vibration

**Ossirs are not bloodhounds that solve your mystery. They are early warning and tactical advantage.**

## Ossir Feeding: The Behavioral Economics Trap

### Do Ossirs "Feed" on Fortune?

**Not on Fortune itself.** They feed on **byproduct**.

Fortune spending creates residue (Heat and drift noise). Ossirs metabolize a portion of that residue, which:
1. Keeps them stable and calibrated
2. Reduces false positives

**They are not generating power. They are reducing noise by consuming waste.**

### The "Offering" Behavior

People can and will "offer" a small bend to an ossir—but it is **not worship**. It is **calibration**.

**Why riders do it:**
- A micro-bend produces a clean, controlled curvature signal
- The ossir "tastes" it and retunes its filters
- The rider gets better signal clarity for the next day

**Why it is dangerous:**
It creates an **incentive problem**:
- Riders start doing "just one more micro-bend" to keep their instrument sharp
- That increases drift and Heat over time
- They become dependent on small bends as maintenance

**This is exactly the kind of slow addiction the world loves.** A maintenance habit that is also a moral hazard.

---

## Ossirs and Time

Time effects produce a distinctive signature:
- A time envelope smears event timing into a "beat blur"
- A time device keeping someone active inside the envelope produces a secondary pattern—like a steady counter-beat

**Ossirs can warn you:**
- Envelope present
- Envelope edge nearby
- Device participation present

**Ossirs cannot:** Tell you who cast it unless you're close enough to pick up Heat on the person.

---

## Ossirs and Density

Density and transfer devices produce "steps" and "seats":
- A properly seated mass transfer feels like a smooth notch shift
- A badly seated transfer produces jagged pulses and recoil noise

**Ossirs are good at detecting:**
- Paired coupling events
- Timed impulse transfers
- Mis-seated rigs that are about to bite the user

**This keeps density combat readable in prose without over-explaining.**

---

## Limits and Failure States

Ossirs have hard limits, or they become a plot solver.

| Limit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Saturation** | Too much distortion → noisy or mute |
| **Cross-talk** | Rider stressed/exhausted/Heat-sick → readings unreliable (instrument coupled to rider's body) |
| **Spoofing** | Skilled crews can lay decoy residue or use "dirty" chronomass for false trails |
| **Dependency** | Over-calibration through constant micro-bends → drift-prone and psychologically reliant |

## Prose Guidelines

### Two Rules for Showing Ossirs

1. **Describe the signal once as a physical phenomenon**
   - Membrane vibration
   - Jaw hum
   - Click train

2. **Then only show interpretation through action**
   - He changes route
   - Delays a bend
   - Refuses a claim
   - Checks a coupler
   - Aborts a time push

**This makes ossirs feel like a real instrument in a lived world, and keeps the smart-reader tone intact.**

## Story Questions (Remaining)

- [ ] Where do ossirs come from? (Bred? Found? Grown?)
- [ ] How is bonding initiated?
- [ ] Can an ossir be transferred to a new rider? (Imprint suggests difficult)
- [ ] What happens when an ossir dies?
- [ ] Legal status variations by type?

## Quick Reference

**Ossir = bonded signal-organism, instrumentation not emotion-reader**

**Four jobs:**
1. Detect probability curvature (Fortune spending)
2. Detect claim threads and collection risk
3. Track Heat and residue
4. Compress into actionable cues

**Mechanism:** Ribbed membrane resonator coupled to rider's bone. Reacts to pattern discontinuities.

**Imprint:** Calibrates to specific rider. Becomes less reliable for others.

**Fortune detection:** Bend vs Claim, clean vs messy, drift accumulation, collection proximity

**Feeding:** Metabolizes Fortune byproduct (Heat/drift noise). NOT powered by Fortune itself.

**The trap:** "Offering" micro-bends for calibration creates drift dependency—maintenance habit that's also moral hazard.

**Limits:** Saturation, cross-talk, spoofing, dependency

## Thematic Role

**Ossirs sit at the boundary between Artifice and Soul.**

They are instruments—not companions, not spirits. They measure, classify, warn. This is Artifice.

But they *bond*. They calibrate to *you specifically*. The "offering" habit creates dependency that feels like relationship. People talk to them, name them, mourn them. This is where Soul bleeds through.

**The thematic tension:** Ossirs are how the system reads your soul. Every Fortune bend, every Heat signature, every Claim thread—your ossir translates your authentic choices into accountable data. You cannot hide from your own instrument.

**Story pressure point:** What happens when your ossir's readings betray you? When the truth you carry becomes the evidence against you?
