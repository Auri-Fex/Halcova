# ARCANE-PUNK DEVICE ECOSYSTEM

## Core Rule

Most devices exist to control **flow** (water, people, fuel, truth, liability). Combat use is an industrial tool pushed into illegal contexts.

---

## H1) Civic Infrastructure (Commission / Gateworks)

| Device | Function | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Gateclock boards** | Schedule teeth + ticks; master timing | Lock gates |
| **Spill governors** | Pressure regulation; intentional floods as policy | Spillways |
| **Towpath tick beacons** | Cadence references in fog | Towpaths |
| **Lock teeth** | Physical gate engagement | Lock mechanisms |
| **Brace seats** | Structural reinforcement mounts | Gate housings |

---

## H2) Seal and Custody (Seal Houses)

| Device | Function | User |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Custody seals** | Tamper evidence via engineered resin behavior | Seal Houses |
| **Sealboxes** | Sealed containers for bonded cargo | Bonded yards |
| **Mark readers** | Verify dot-strings, admissibility, routing | Seal benches |
| **Stamp plates** | Apply House-specific seal marks | Seal clerks |

---

## H3) Chronomass Handling (Assay Economy)

| Device | Function | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Assay lanterns** | Residue/grade reads | Assay benches |
| **Setters** | Raw→Set conversion under metered control | Setter benches |
| **Purge kits** | Controlled venting; always logged | Assay/decon |
| **Grade vials** | Sample storage with stability indicators | Everywhere |

---

## H4) Time Countermeasure Stack

| Device | Function | User |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Sync mantles** | Active-in-envelope protection | Mantled personnel |
| **Trip lattices** | Announce envelope events | Security perimeters |
| **Cadence pins** | Keep squads synced against Blink peeling | Order Companies |
| **Anchor clocks** | Fixed time reference points | Critical infrastructure |

---

## H5) Density Engineering Stack

| Device | Function | Constraint |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Bulk jigs** | Mode B geometry constraint | Prevents uncontrolled growth |
| **Load balancers** | Mode M stabilization for cranes/gates | Requires calibration |
| **Volume spreaders** | Mode V emergency bridging/barriers | Known weakness at scale |
| **Transfer Mates** | Paired clamps for density operations | Non-living only |

---

## H6) Enforcement/Inspection Tools

| Device | Function | Evidence Type |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Seam chalk** | Marks density transfer boundaries | Visual |
| **Residue cuffs** | Collect chronomass residue samples | Chemical |
| **Portable assay plates** | Field testing for chronomass | Grade reading |
| **Evidence pouches** | Sealed sample containers | Custody chain |

**Key Principle:** Evidence handling is procedural. "Proof over names" is how contracts pay out.

## H7) Comms and Navigation (Non-Radio)

| Device | Function | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Signal boards** | Posted slips tied to ticks | Master schedule reference |
| **Route compasses** | Point to next permitted authority lane | Not north—legal direction |
| **Tick beacons** | Time/location reference signals | Especially useful in fog |
| **Slip rails** | Organized posting system | New/Else rail separation |

---

## H8) Labor/Medicine/Survival

| Device | Function | Risk |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Tremor dampers** | Counter mantle side effects | Chronic use damage |
| **Heat sinks** | Manage waste heat from operations | Overflow burns |
| **Respirators** | Filter endemic spores/vapors | Filter saturation |
| **Decon lanes** | Systematic contamination removal | Queue bottleneck |

---

## H9) Domestic Devices

| Device | Function | Forensic Tell |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Wick heaters** | Home heating with endemic fuel | Wickmold soot signature |
| **Ledger lamps** | Time-stamped proof for wages/curfews | Light duration records |
| **Seal boxes (domestic)** | Small-scale tamper evidence | Resin fracture patterns |

---

## Device Forensics Summary

Every device leaves evidence. Counterfeit devices fail the evidence test.

| Device Type | Primary Tell |
|-------------|--------------|
| Seal resin | Fracture geometry |
| Assay lantern | Wick film pattern |
| Transfer Mate | Clamp scorch + seam dust |
| Sync mantle | Wear pattern + tremor signature |
| Chronomass lot | Grade reading + vent history |

## Thematic Role: Artifice

**Devices are Artifice made material.**

The device ecosystem represents what Druskar values: documented, regulated, predictable, enforceable. Every device category serves the same purpose—turning supernatural capability into infrastructure.

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Measurable** | Devices produce readings, states, tells—all accountable |
| **Regulated** | Seal Houses certify, Order Companies enforce, Commission schedules |
| **Impersonal** | Anyone can operate a device; innate ability is rare |
| **Safer** | Devices distribute Heat; innate users concentrate it |

**Why people choose Artifice:**
- Devices don't mark you. Innate ability leaves forensic trails on *you*.
- Devices are purchasable. Innate ability is born or bonded.
- Devices can be abandoned. Your soul bleeds through regardless.

**The cost of Artifice:**
- When devices fail, you have nothing.
- When devices are confiscated, you're defenseless.
- When the system controls the devices, it controls you.

**Story pressure point:** A character who relies entirely on devices is safer but dependent. A character with innate ability is dangerous but visible. The system prefers the former.
