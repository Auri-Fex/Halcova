# ODDSWORK — Luck as Settlement (Complete Reference)

## Core Concept

Oddswork is **luck as a tradeable, trackable, enforceable commodity**. It operates like a financial system where probability itself has a ledger.

---

## The Three Ledgers

### 1. FORTUNE
**Definition:** Spendable balance used to tilt outcomes in your favor.

**Earning Fortune (Control Test):**
- Fortune can **only** be earned by wagering on outcomes you **cannot control**
- Fraud-tainted wagering produces Heat/Claim risk instead of clean Fortune
- The universe knows the difference between "didn't control" and "pretended not to control"

**Spending Fortune:**
- Small bends: survivable, low Heat
- Medium bends: become lifestyle; regular Heat accumulation
- Large bends: create correlated Claims and enforcement interest

### 2. HEAT
**Definition:** Attention and externality load created by probability bends.

**Sources:**
- Active Fortune spending
- Improbable outcomes (even natural ones draw suspicion)
- Proximity to other high-Heat individuals
- Repeated "lucky" patterns

**Consequences:**
- Heat clusters attract investigators
- Insurance companies track Heat signatures
- Order Companies use Heat as probable cause
- High Heat makes you expensive to associate with

### 3. CLAIMS
**Definition:** Deferred settlement that comes due later—often clustered and context-cruel.

**Behavior:**
- Claims accrue invisibly
- Settlement timing is unpredictable
- Claims often cluster (multiple coming due at once)
- Context-cruel: Claims tend to settle at the worst possible moment
- Cannot be fully tracked by the holder

## Professional Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Pool Captain** | Manages collective Fortune pools; spreads Heat |
| **Claim Surgeon** | Attempts to predict/manage Claim settlement timing |
| **Queue Broker** | Arranges Fortune trades and wager opportunities |

---

## Forensic Detection

**Heat clustering:** Investigators map where improbable outcomes cluster geographically or around individuals.

**Streak signatures:** Patterns around queues, schedules, auctions that indicate Fortune spending.

**Claim timing correlations:** When multiple Claims settle simultaneously, it suggests coordinated Fortune use.

---

## Economic Integration

- Fortune is not officially currency but functions as one
- Insurance companies price around Heat exposure
- Contracts often include Oddswork disclosure clauses
- "Clean Fortune" (earned through genuine uncontrolled wagers) trades at premium
- "Dirty Fortune" (fraud-tainted) is detectable through Heat signature

---

## Social Implications

- Gambling is not vice; it's **Fortune farming**
- Casinos are **Fortune factories** with regulated Heat dispersal
- "Lucky" individuals are viewed with suspicion (high Heat)
- Claims create social debt that affects reputation
- Oddswork disclosure is part of professional licensing

## Story Hooks

1. A character with high Claims approaching settlement timing
2. Heat investigation targeting innocent-looking patterns
3. Fortune pool politics between competing factions
4. Claim Surgeon miscalculation with catastrophic results
5. Queue Broker running a dirty Fortune scheme
