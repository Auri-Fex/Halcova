## THE SUBSTRATE

**CHRONOMASS** = Refined chronophage resin. Reactive working fluid. Responds to metering (valves, throttles, wick mesh, coil drivers). **Leaves Heat.**

**Origin:** Chronophages ("time flies")—native insects that metabolize time-adjacent gradients and excrete resin.

**Four Dangers:**
1. **Spoiling** (stutter, surge, recoil)
2. **Time sickness** (vertigo, double hearing, afterimages, tremor, memory shear)
3. **Heat** (forensic trace, device stress, ossir confusion)
4. **Mechanical failure** (coils crack, valves slip, seals spit)

## THE THREE SYSTEMS

| System | One-Line | Access | Chronomass? | Cost |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| **FORTUNE** | Probability budget to tilt outcomes | **UNIVERSAL** | NO | Heat, Drift, Collection |
| **TIME** | Turn-stealing via local dilation | **RARE** | Devices only | Heat, blowback, cognitive debt |
| **DENSITY** | Physics leverage via mass/volume | **RARE** | Devices only | Strain, shear, loud Heat |

**OSSIRS** = Universal. Everyone carries one. Instrumentation layer for Fortune/Heat/system detection.

## DENSITY DEVICE MODES

| Mode | What Transfers | Effect |
|------|---------------|--------|
| I | Mass only | Volume constant, weight changes |
| II | Volume only | Mass constant, size changes |
| III | Mass + Volume | Full property swap |
| IV | Timed Impulse | High-flow momentary, rewards skill |
| V | Volume (no mass swap) | Size changes, density spikes, **failure-prone** |

## OSSIRS (Universal Instrumentation)

**What:** Bonded signal-organism. Instrumentation, NOT emotion-reader. **Everyone has one.**

**Four Jobs:**
1. Detect probability curvature (Fortune spending)
2. Detect claim threads / collection risk
3. Track Heat and residue
4. Compress into actionable cues (tones, harmonics, clicks)

**Mechanism:** Ribbed membrane resonator coupled to rider's bone. Reacts to pattern discontinuities in the world's "noise floor."

**Fortune Detection:**
- Bend vs Claim (smooth slope vs hooked ridge)
- Clean vs messy bend
- Drift accumulation (persistent harmonic)
- Collection proximity (hook gets louder)

**The Calibration Trap:** "Offering" micro-bends keeps ossir sharp but creates drift dependency. Maintenance habit = moral hazard.

**Limits:** Saturation (too much distortion), cross-talk (rider stress), spoofing (decoy residue), dependency (over-calibration)

## INTERACTION RULES

| Combo | Clean? |
|-------|--------|
| Fortune + Time | ✓ |
| Fortune + Density | ✓ |
| Time + Density | ✓ |
| All Three | RARE — costly, signature, whole city smells it |

## FORENSIC TELLS (Every System)

- Heat signature (residue, trace)
- Pattern analysis (too many coincidences)
- Ossir detection (distortion sensing)
- Physiological indicators (time: tremor; density: strain)
- Material evidence (coupling sites, stress patterns)

## CANON LOCKS (Non-Negotiable)

- [ ] **Conservation-first:** Nothing free. Everything has cost.
- [ ] **Fortune is UNIVERSAL:** Everyone has it. Everyone plays the game.
- [ ] **Ossirs are UNIVERSAL:** Everyone carries one. Instrumentation layer.
- [ ] **Time/Density are RARE:** Specialized talent or expensive devices.
- [ ] **No-Field rule:** Dead matter can't create time distortion.
- [ ] **Devices manage, don't originate:** Time devices are countermeasures, not time guns.
- [ ] **Chronomass is mechanical:** Metering and feedback, no spoken triggers.
- [ ] **Nonlinear scaling:** Bigger effects cost exponentially more.
- [ ] **Heat is always on:** You cannot use systems without leaving traces.
- [ ] **Fortune ≠ Chronomass:** Fortune is powered by wagers, not fuel.
- [ ] **Innate talents ≠ Chronomass:** Seatcraft and density rigcraft don't need fuel—devices do.
- [ ] **Chronomass from chronophages:** "Time flies" are the supply chain, not mascots.
- [ ] **Ossir calibration trap:** Micro-bend offerings create drift dependency.

## SCENE CHECKLIST

Before writing any scene with system use:

1. **Fortune:** Budget? Claims pending? Drift pattern?
2. **Time:** Seatcraft present? Devices? Countermeasures?
3. **Density:** Capabilities? Strain levels? Devices?
4. **Ossirs:** What are they saying? Clean or noisy?
5. **Heat:** Who's watching? Who will care?
6. **Cost:** What does this use actually cost the character?
