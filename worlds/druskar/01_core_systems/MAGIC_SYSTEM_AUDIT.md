# DRUSKAR MAGIC SYSTEM AUDIT

> **Purpose:** Logic/rationality check + Claims model integration  
> **Status:** ✅ CORE SYSTEMS DOCUMENTED + CLAIMS SPECIFIED  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-01-04

---

## Executive Summary

**MAJOR UPDATE:** Full Claims specification integrated. Logic audit completed.

The Druskar magic systems are **fundamentally sound** with good internal consistency:
1. **Clear access hierarchy** (Fortune/Ossirs universal, Time/Density rare)
2. **Distinct mechanical roles** (Fortune = timing, Density = physics, Time = turn-stealing)
3. **Consistent cost structures** (Heat, drift, physiological debt, chronomass burn)
4. **Appropriate failure states** (spoiling, time sickness, strain/shear, collection)

**Primary Gap Filled:** Claims now have full mechanical specification.

## CLAIMS — FULL SPECIFICATION (NEW)

### What A Claim IS

A **claim** is a **formalized Fortune spend** that creates a **recognizable obligation** in the metaphysical accounting layer.

- **Bend:** "I nudge odds and hope nobody notices."
- **Claim:** "I take a result large enough that the world can index it."

**Key property:** A claim is **trackable** and **collectible**. It leaves a signature that persists.

### What Claims Are NOT

- Not a spoken spell
- Not a legal document
- Not necessarily visible to normal humans
- Not "the universe has feelings"

Claims are closer to **a secured transaction** than a curse. You borrow outcome from uncertainty and post yourself as collateral.

---

### Why Claims Exist (Design Rationale)

The world needs two things to stay coherent:
1. Fortune must be powerful enough to matter
2. Fortune must not be free, repeatable, or untraceable

**Claims are the enforcement mechanism.** They are the cost accounting that makes probability manipulation stable and scary.

---

### How A Claim Is Implemented

**Implementation is internal, not theatrical.**

A person implements a claim by performing a Fortune spend past a threshold.

**Two triggers:**

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Magnitude threshold** | Probability shift too large to smooth into background variance |
| **Specificity threshold** | Fortune bound to very specific outcome instead of general nudge |

Experienced people feel the difference. Ossirs hear it clearly.

**Speaking is optional:** Some people speak a short phrase as habit because it helps focus, makes the act psychologically real, and functions as a personal receipt. The phrase is not magic—it's ritualized interface.

---

### Claim Structure (Six Fields)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subject** | Who is bound (usually claimant, sometimes also beneficiary) |
| **Scope** | How big and how wide the outcome distortion |
| **Vector** | What kind of uncertainty borrowed (timing, encounter, mechanical failure, attention) |
| **Anchor** | Handle that makes it collectible (person, place, habit, object, **route**) |
| **Maturity** | When it wants to settle (quick or dragged for weeks) |
| **Signature** | Residue pattern (what ossirs and tuned instruments detect) |

**Note:** Routes make good anchors. This is why "routes are keys" is powerful.

---

### Claim Lifecycle (Three Phases)

#### Phase 1: Seating

Claim seats into local probability landscape.
- Chaotic/uncertain situations = easier seating
- Sterile/controlled situations = harder seating, louder residue

#### Phase 2: Drift and Reinforcement

After seating, the world biases around you:
- Unusually good luck in claimed direction
- Unusually bad luck in adjacent domains

**This is mechanical, not cosmic malice. Statistical tilt.**

#### Phase 3: Collection

Eventually the claim resolves into a **collection event**.

**Three shapes:**

| Shape | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct reversal** | Same domain pays back | Claimed safety in chase → later trip on normal stair, break ribs |
| **Substitution** | Debt transfers to someone connected | Claimed shot lands → friend takes random hit that should have missed |
| **Constraint tightening** | Options narrow until paid | Claimed clean escape → doors that should be open are shut, people arrive early, friction accumulates |

**The world does not punish. It closes books.**

---

### Clean vs Dirty Claims

| Type | Seats in | Wording | Settles | Residue | Result |
|------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Clean** | High uncertainty | Broad | Quickly, locally | Light | Hard to track |
| **Dirty** | Controlled conditions | Highly specific | Stretched over time | Loud | Easy to hunt |

**Dirty claims are how people get tracked and killed.**

---

### Claim Visibility (Who Sees What)

| Observer | What They Detect |
|----------|------------------|
| **Normal people** | Infer from behavior and coincidence patterns |
| **Ossirs** | Seating, hook signature, rising collection pressure |
| **Tuned instruments** | Claim residue, can record it |
| **Skilled opponents** | Statistical footprint; can force you into low-uncertainty environments |

---

### Claim Tactics

#### How Protagonists Use Claims Fairly

- Use for **pivotal windows**, not routine success
- Use for **permission to act**, not "I win"

| Fair Use | Unfair Use |
|----------|------------|
| Guard looks away | Entire patrol disappears |
| Single shot lands | Every enemy misses |
| One door stays unlatched | Whole building opens |

#### How Antagonists Counter Claims

1. **Force controlled spaces** — claims seat harder, become dirty
2. **Reduce uncertainty with discipline** — fewer seating opportunities
3. **Add noise and decoys** — claim anchors to wrong thing
4. **Track residue** — ossirs, tuned plates
5. **Create moral hazard** — bait repeated claims, let collection hit when weak

**This makes Fortune users feel like gamblers under pressure.** Exactly the tone wanted.

---

### Claims + Time/Density Interaction

Claims do **not directly power** Time or Density. They **bias the probability of outcomes** within those domains.

| System | Claim Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **Time** | "Claim my Blink window coincides with a gap in attention" |
| **Density** | "Claim the coupler seats cleanly on impact" |
| **Device timing** | "Claim the transfer impulse hits at exact instant target commits weight" |

**Claims grease precision.**

---

### The Scariest Part (Design Win)

Claims create **endogenous risk**.

Every time you choose to be "lucky," you also choose to become a more legible object in the city's accounting layer. **It is a self-generated pursuit signal.**

That is why this feels **rational and terrifying** without needing gods.

---

## DARK BUT ENTERTAINING ASSESSMENT

### What Makes It Dark

| Element | Darkness Factor |
|---------|-----------------|
| Fortune accounting | No one to plead with; universe just balances books |
| Collection mechanics | Debts settle at worst possible moments |
| Claims as pursuit signals | Using luck makes you trackable |
| Drift accumulation | Cursed in domains you neglect |
| Time sickness | Physiological horror |
| Density failure states | Microfractures, shear, joint collapse |
| Chronomass spoiling | Chemistry + negligence = "fated" accidents |
| Calibration trap | The helpful habit destroys you |

### What Makes It Entertaining

| Element | Entertainment Factor |
|---------|---------------------|
| Plausibly deniable Fortune | Cool moments without superhero vibes |
| Tactical time work | Planning beats raw talent |
| Density combat moments | Impact-focused, grapple-ready |
| Device countermeasures | Fair fights despite power differences |
| Ossir personalization | Tools with personality and liability |
| Chronomass economy | Heist/supply-chain plots |

### Balance Verdict: ✅ WELL CALIBRATED

**Key design wins:**

1. **Costs are mechanical, not moralistic**
   - Not punished for being greedy—punished because math works that way
   - Creates dread without preachiness

2. **Power has hard limits**
   - Fortune tilts, doesn't replace skill
   - Time can be countered by devices
   - Density has brutal failure states
   - No "I win" buttons

3. **Information asymmetry creates tension**
   - Ossirs detect but don't solve
   - Heat marks but doesn't condemn
   - Claims trackable but require expertise

4. **Characters can choose risk level**
   - Small bends nearly free
   - Big claims available but costly
   - Real dramatic choices

## CANON STATEMENT (For Integration)

> **A claim is a Fortune spend large enough to become a collectible obligation.** It seats into uncertainty, leaves a signature that ossirs can hear, and later resolves as a collection event that closes the borrowed probability.
>
> Claims have structure: a subject who is bound, a scope defining the distortion's size, a vector identifying what kind of uncertainty is borrowed, an anchor that makes it trackable, a maturity window for settlement, and a signature residue pattern.
>
> Collection takes three shapes: **direct reversal** (claimed safety becomes sudden injury), **substitution** (debt transfers to someone connected to you), or **constraint tightening** (options narrow until payment is extracted).
>
> **Clean claims** seat in high uncertainty, use broad wording, settle quickly, and leave light residue. **Dirty claims** seat in controlled conditions, are highly specific, stretch payment over time, and leave signatures that can be tracked.
>
> **The world does not punish. It closes books.**
