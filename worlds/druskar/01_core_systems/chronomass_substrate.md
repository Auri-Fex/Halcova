## Core Definition

Chronomass is a **refined reactive working fluid**. Think of it like the arcane-punk equivalent of high-test fuel plus solvent plus battery.

Chronomass is the reason you can have an arcane-punk world with combat tech that still feels mechanical.

---

## Physical Form

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Raw harvest** | Viscous resin and volatile condensate |
| **Refined grades** | Stabilized into sealed grades that can be metered through valves and coils without "running away" |
| **Transport** | Casks with **shock control** and **salt-thread sealing** (vibration and thermal swings push it toward instability) |

---

## Origin: The "Time Flies" Concept

Chronomass comes from Druskar-native insects: the **chronophages**.

- Street people call them **"time flies"** because it's easier than saying "chronophage" and because the farms look like fly works
- Chronophages metabolize **time-adjacent gradients** and excrete a resin that can be stabilized into Chronomass
- They are **not mascots**—they are a supply chain and a public hazard

---

## Why It Powers Tech

Chronomass responds to **metering**:
- Valves
- Throttles
- Wick mesh
- Coil drivers
- Living feedback loops

This is why the world can be **arcane-punk rather than wand fantasy**.

## The Four Dangers

These should be treated like the dangers of volatile fuel plus industrial chemical plus "physics debt."

### 1. Spoiling and Runaway Behavior

Chronomass can "spoil" if it is:
- Poorly stabilized
- Contaminated
- Overheated
- Shock abused

**Practical outcomes:**
- Devices stutter and then surge
- Timing effects become jagged instead of smooth
- Paired transfer devices mis-seat and recoil
- Mantles that should allow movement in a time envelope instead cause partial lock and injury

**Narrative use:** Spoiled Chronomass is how you get accidents that look like fate but are actually chemistry plus negligence.

### 2. Exposure: Time Sickness

Chronomass exposure has an **unmistakable body signature**. Not mystical, not emotional—**physiological**.

**Acute exposure symptoms (CANON):**

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vertigo** | Comes in pulses |
| **Double hearing** | Delayed or echoed audio |
| **Visual afterimages** | Lag behind moving objects |
| **Tremor** | Fine motor control degradation |
| **Nausea/dry-mouth** | Standard toxic response |
| **Memory shear** | Can recount a sequence but lose the order you experienced it in |

This lets you write danger without needing "the world is angry at you" vibes.

### 3. Heat: Trace and Attention

Chronomass use leaves **Heat**. Heat is the forensic residue and the social alarm bell.

**What Heat does in practice:**
- Makes you easier to track by trained crews and instruments
- Increases the risk that devices misbehave under stress
- Makes certain places "feel wrong" to ossirs (party loses signal confidence)

**Heat is the reason arcane tech is powerful but not casually spammed.**

### 4. Mechanical Failure States

Every big effect gets a simple failure mode tied to parts:

| Component | Failure Mode |
|-----------|--------------|
| Coil drivers | Burn and crack |
| Valve teeth | Slip |
| Wick mesh | Clog |
| Seals | Spit |
| Reservoirs | Bulge before breach |

This is where arcane-punk earns its keep.

## Relationship to the Three Systems

### Fortune

**Fortune is NOT powered by Chronomass.** It is powered by your personal fortune budget and wager rules.

Chronomass intersects Fortune in two places:
1. **As a commodity** people wager on and steal
2. **As a Heat amplifier**—Fortune use around Chronomass is more likely to attract consequences

### Time

**Time talent is innate and rare.** Chronomass is how the world industrializes timing effects.

| Category | Chronomass Role |
|----------|-----------------|
| Innate Blink | Does NOT require carrying Chronomass |
| Time devices/mantles | Chronomass-driven |
| Abuse effects | Micro-lock, coil burn, bodily strain |

### Density

Same model as time.

| Category | Chronomass Role |
|----------|-----------------|
| Innate density rigcraft | Body-cost system (cap/flow/strain), no Chronomass required |
| Density devices (non-innates) | Chronomass-driven and paired-coupled |
| Spoiled Chronomass | Especially dangerous in paired transfer modes—creates bad seating and recoil events |

### Ossirs

- Tuned with measured chronomass vapor
- Detect chronomass-related pattern distortion
- Lose signal confidence in high-Heat areas

## The On-Page Explanation

For Book 1, at the first "Chronomass transport" moment, the reader needs one clean sentence:

> "Chronomass was refined chronophage resin, stabilized so it would obey valves and coils, and if it spoiled it did not explode—it stuttered, and stutter was how people got hurt."

---

## Quick Reference

**Chronomass = refined chronophage resin, reactive working fluid**

**Physical:** Raw resin → refined grades → casks with shock control and salt-thread sealing

**Origin:** Chronophages ("time flies")—native insects that excrete time-reactive resin

**Metering:** Valves, throttles, wick mesh, coil drivers, living feedback

**Four Dangers:**
1. Spoiling/runaway (stutter, surge, recoil)
2. Time sickness (vertigo, double hearing, afterimages, tremor, memory shear)
3. Heat (forensic trace, device stress, ossir confusion)
4. Mechanical failure (coils crack, valves slip, seals spit)

**System relationships:**
- Fortune: NOT powered by chronomass (commodity and Heat amplifier only)
- Time: Innate talent doesn't need it; devices do
- Density: Innate rigcraft doesn't need it; paired devices do
