# INTERNAL RIVALS — The State Fights Itself

## Strategic Reality

Puljitos isn't unified. Knalvossak's monopoly on turning fuel into legality creates resentment. Other power centers want a piece of that legitimacy.

---

## KROVAM — The Belt Market Rival

**Suffix:** -am (market town)
**Location:** Kronvar Belt
**Full Name:** Kronvar Beltmarket

### Position
Not a commission-seat. Krovam wants **"truth power"** (grading legitimacy) so Knalvossak stops skimming margin by monopoly.

### Argument
"We grow the chronomass. We process it. Why does Knalvossak get to decide what it's worth?"

### Power Base
- Belt Houses (especially House Velt and House Ornan)
- Setter operations
- Krovam Shield Service (Order Company)

### Tactics
- Push for "Belt-grade" as independent standard
- Challenge Knalvossak assay reads
- Build Krovam Bench authority
- Use quarantine as leverage (control what's "touch-legal")

### Weakness
- No direct water access to outer trade
- Dependent on Knalvossak routing for export
- Krovam Bench constantly challenged by Knalvossak Houses

---

## RASKESH — The Marchwater Rival

**Suffix:** -esh (quay/port enclave)
**Location:** Brinav March
**Full Name:** Marchwater Port Enclave

### Position
Wants to bond and export without routing everything through Knalvossak. They see Knalvossak as a choke; Knalvossak treats them as a leak.

### Argument
"The March has its own water. Why should we pay Knalvossak to reach it?"

### Power Base
- March bloom economy
- Smuggling infrastructure
- Reedward Contract Patrol (Order Company—complicated relationship)

### Tactics
- Build Raskesh Bench authority
- Establish "good enough" bonding standards
- Court Veskari as alternative outlet
- Exploit bloom season chaos to move goods

### Weakness
- Knalvossak questions every Raskesh stamp
- Selren blacklists Raskesh more readily than Knalvossak
- Bloom season cuts both ways (opportunity and chaos)

## SARNKETH — The Quarantine Throat

**Suffix:** -keth (checkpoint hamlet)
**Location:** Kronvar Belt / Knalvossak approach
**Function:** Quarantine checkpoint where lots become **touch-legal**

### What "Touch-Legal" Means
Permissible to handle under quarantine protocol. Not "good"—just "not automatically seized for contact."

### Strategic Position
Sarnketh creates late-failure scandals that become policy weapons. If a lot passes Sarnketh and fails later, who's responsible?

### Power Dynamics
- **Belt Houses** want lenient standards (faster throughput)
- **Knalvossak** wants strict standards (maintains monopoly)
- **Sarnketh officials** are caught between (and can profit from both)

### Scandal Potential
- Late-failure lots create lawsuits
- "Who stamped it touch-legal?" is a career-ending question
- Sarnketh stamps become political ammunition

## THE BELT HOUSES — Internal Kronvar Rivalries

### House Velt
**Philosophy:** High-volume, conservative protocols, low variance, hard to counterfeit
**Strength:** Reliability; Knalvossak trusts Velt stamps
**Weakness:** Slow; expensive; loses market share to cheaper options

### House Ornan
**Philosophy:** Experimental starters, aggressive yields, higher late-failure risk
**Strength:** Higher profit margins; innovation
**Weakness:** Late-failure scandals; Knalvossak skepticism

### House Kivren
**Philosophy:** Transport/custody specialists; profit from routing and schedule control
**Strength:** Don't compete on production—compete on logistics
**Weakness:** Dependent on other Houses for actual chronomass

### Inter-House Conflict
- Velt vs. Ornan: Conservative vs. aggressive processing
- Both vs. Kivren: Production vs. transport margins
- All vs. Knalvossak: Belt autonomy vs. city monopoly

---

## ORDER COMPANY RIVALRIES

### Gaturline Order (Knalvossak)
**Wants:** Everything routed through Knalvossak lanes
**Benefit:** Gate fees, escort contracts, seizure percentages

### Krovam Shield Service (Belt)
**Wants:** Belt autonomy and lower Knalvossak interference
**Benefit:** Convoy protection, quarantine control fees

### Reedward Contract Patrol (March)
**Wants:** The March to stay "dangerous"
**Benefit:** Higher contract rates when risk is high

### Structural Conflict
Each Order Company profits from conditions that hurt the others:
- Gaturline wants centralization
- Krovam Shield wants regional autonomy
- Reedward wants chaos

## How Internal Rivals Use External Pressure

| Rival | Uses Veskari | Uses Selren |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Krovam** | Threatens to route Belt exports differently | Points to Selren standards to justify independence |
| **Raskesh** | Courts as alternative outlet | Victim of blacklisting; uses for sympathy |
| **Sarnketh** | Blames for contamination pressure | Uses quarantine standards as cover |

---

## Story Potential

| Scenario | Conflict |
|----------|----------|
| Belt House starter war | Ornan innovation vs. Velt tradition |
| Krovam bench challenge | Who decides what's real? |
| Raskesh bonding scandal | Knalvossak weaponizes quality |
| Sarnketh late-failure | Chain of blame |
| Order Company turf war | Enforcement contract disputes |
