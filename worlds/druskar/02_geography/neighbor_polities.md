# NEIGHBOR POLITIES — External Pressure on Puljitos

## Strategic Reality

Puljitos survives by turning chokepoints into legitimacy. But it's squeezed from two directions:
- **Veskari** from the sea (tariffs and blockades)
- **Selren** from the land (quarantine and blacklists)

This external pressure keeps Puljitos mean. The state can't afford to be soft when rivals are waiting to strangle its commerce.

## VESKARI — Tariff + Blockade Doctrine

### Governing Principle
**"Tolls are sovereignty."**

Paper-backed cutters and lawful-looking privateers enforce Veskari's position that controlling passage means controlling legitimacy.

### Regions (Trade Map Style)

| Region | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Veskesh Reach** | Capital port; administrative center |
| **Tarvek Yardchain** | Yards, chain stock, hull frames |
| **Sornam Coastmarket** | Auctions, charter brokers, blockade drafting |
| **Reedward Shoals** | Marsh-islands; smuggling and inspectors |

### Sea Lane Choke: BRINAV NARROWS

**Control Point:** Skelur (ur) — fort-watch
**Method:**
- Buoy chain defines legal channel
- Tick beacons establish timing requirements
- Bond cutters enforce compliance
- Assay lanterns justify seizures as "customs"

**Veskari Position:** If it passes through the Narrows without paying, it's contraband. Period.

### Veskari Tactics

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Tariff bands** | A/B/C pricing tiers based on cargo and season |
| **Channel restriction** | Narrow the legal channel during disputes |
| **Drift enforcement** | Treat off-cadence movement as evasion |
| **Customs seizure** | Assay "failures" become legal theft |

### Relations with Puljitos
- Constant tariff negotiation
- Mutual accusations of piracy vs. smuggling
- Seasonal escalation during bloom tiers
- Neither wants war; both want maximum extraction

## SELREN — Quarantine + Blacklist Doctrine

### Governing Principle
**"Clean passage outranks commerce."**

Selren denies admissibility before they seize goods. They don't need to take your cargo—they just make it worthless by declaring it inadmissible.

### Regions

| Region | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Selrendur Keepseat** | Capital fortress administration |
| **Whitecord Cordon** | Border belt of lanes, pens, burn pits |
| **Harmek Step** | Upland logistics spine |
| **Clinvek Works** | Decon kit, filters, meters—evidence supply |

### Border Choke: WHITECORD GATE

**Control Point:** Vordketh (keth) — checkpoint complex
**Trade Name:** Whitecord Gate
**Method:** Three-lane system

| Lane | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Clear** | Immediate passage (rare) |
| **Wash** | Decontamination required |
| **Hold** | Detained pending review |

**Selren Position:** Your papers are only as good as your cleanliness. Contaminated cargo is inadmissible cargo.

### Selren Tactics

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Blacklisting** | Declare bench/carrier/lot class inadmissible |
| **Wash requirements** | Force expensive decontamination |
| **Hold delays** | Time costs money |
| **Reinstatement theater** | Make getting off blacklist expensive |

### Relations with Puljitos
- Selren throttles Puljitos by admissibility
- Puljitos answers by routing around (smuggling pressure into Jitknal)
- Each side uses the other as excuse for internal policy
- "Selren standards" becomes code for excessive caution

## How External Pressure Shapes Internal Politics

### Veskari Pressure Creates:
- Demand for alternative routes (benefits Raskesh, Jitknal smugglers)
- Tariff-avoidance corruption (benefits certain Commission clerks)
- Convoy economics (benefits Order Companies, especially Krovam Shield)

### Selren Pressure Creates:
- Quarantine bureaucracy (benefits Seal Houses, especially Kelm)
- Decon industry (benefits Clinvek-aligned suppliers)
- Blacklist fear (used as internal political weapon)

## Diplomatic Instruments

### With Veskari
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Tariff Notice Slip** | Channel posture and pricing |
| **Bond papers** | Pre-cleared cargo documentation |
| **Customs warrant** | Seizure authorization |

### With Selren
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Blacklist Notice Slip** | Who/what is inadmissible |
| **Wash certification** | Decon completion proof |
| **Admissibility note** | Bench-specific acceptance |

---

## Story Potential

| Scenario | Conflict |
|----------|----------|
| Narrows blockade during bloom season | Economic warfare escalation |
| Blacklist targeting specific House | Internal Puljitos factional fight |
| Veskari privateer with legal charter | "Legitimate" piracy |
| Selren contamination accusation | Proving a negative |
| Playing Veskari against Selren | Dangerous diplomacy |

## Thematic Role: The Absence of Hospitality

**External pressure demonstrates why hospitality died.**

Puljitos is squeezed between two powers that treat movement as leverage. This pressure makes the internal system mean, defensive, and transactional.

| Polity | What They Enforce |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Veskari** | Tolls are sovereignty—every passage is priced |
| **Selren** | Cleanliness outranks commerce—admissibility is denial power |

**Why hospitality is absent:**
- When external threats are constant, sharing becomes weakness
- When tariffs and blacklists are normal, every favor is a potential liability
- When passage requires papers, shelter requires custody

**The thematic wound:** Somewhere in history, there were guest-rights. Travelers were welcomed. Help didn't create debt. But Veskari tariffs and Selren blacklists made that impossible. Now, protection means custody, and shelter means collateral.

**Story pressure point:** A character offering hospitality in this environment isn't just generous—they're creating vulnerability. What happens when the person you sheltered without papers gets traced back to you?
