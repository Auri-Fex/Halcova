## The Five Tracts

### T1·JITKNAL — The Labyrinth
**Legacy Written:** Jitknalos
**Spoken/Trade:** Jitknal
**Descriptor:** Labyrinth

**Character:** Where navigation becomes probability. The last reliable hardground ends at Knalvossak; beyond lies the Labyrinth.

**Economy:**
- Grey market chronomass (wild traps)
- Raw/Cut lots with high residue risk
- Smuggling routes that bypass official channels

**Governance:** Nominally Puljitos; practically ungovernable. The state's reach extends to the edges but not into the heart.

**Key Locations:**
- Jitesh (esh) — drift landing
- Jitot (ot) — outstation
- Lanterncut (bare) — posted narrow cut

---

### T2·KRONVAR — The Belt
**Descriptor:** Belt

**Character:** The legal mainline. Charter farms produce most Set chronomass lots. This is where fuel becomes legitimate.

**Economy:**
- Charter chronomass farms (Kronofag cultivation)
- Setter operations (Raw→Set conversion)
- Quarantine infrastructure

**Governance:** Strong state presence; Belt Houses hold significant power

**Key Locations:**
- Krovam (am) — rival market city; wants grading legitimacy
- Sarnketh (keth) — quarantine throat; touch-legal stamp point

**Belt Houses:**
- **House Velt:** High-volume, conservative protocols, low variance
- **House Ornan:** Experimental starters, aggressive yields, higher late-failure risk
- **House Kivren:** Transport/custody specialists; profit from routing and schedule control

---

### T3·BRINAV — The March
**Descriptor:** March

**Character:** Seasonal chaos. Brackwater blooms create shock supply and counterfeit incentives. The March makes its own rules during surge weeks.

**Economy:**
- Seasonal chronomass blooms
- Smuggling infrastructure
- Night-reed routes

**Governance:** State control fluctuates with bloom tiers; Reedward Patrol profits from danger

**Key Locations:**
- Raskesh (esh) — rival port enclave; wants export autonomy
- Brinefield (bare) — low flats industry

**Bloom Calendar:** See Appendix A in world_bible.md

### T4·KESTNAR — The Step
**Descriptor:** Step

**Character:** Upland logistics spine. Elevation changes managed through stepped lock systems.

**Economy:**
- Lock infrastructure maintenance
- Elevation transit services
- Mountain-source water management

**Governance:** Commission-controlled; strategic for water flow

---

### T5·VARNEK — The Flats
**Descriptor:** Flats

**Character:** Low-lying industrial zones. Processing, storage, and labor-intensive operations.

**Economy:**
- Bulk processing
- Warehouse districts
- Labor pools

**Governance:** Mixed Commission and private control

## Inter-Tract Tensions

| Tract | Wants | Threatens |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Jitknal | Autonomy | Bypass legitimate channels |
| Kronvar | Grading authority | Undercut Knalvossak monopoly |
| Brinav | Export freedom | Leak cargo around controls |
| Kestnar | Water priority | Upstream leverage |
| Varnek | Labor rights | Strike disruption |

## Tract Movement

**Legal Movement:** Requires proper stamps, seals, and routing through designated gates
**Grey Movement:** Jitknal routes bypass official channels but carry risk
**Enforcement:** Order Companies patrol tract boundaries; crossing wrong creates evidence
