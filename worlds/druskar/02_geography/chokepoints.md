# CHOKEPOINTS — Strategic Pressure Points

## Core Principle

In Druskar, controlling a chokepoint means controlling legitimacy. The state's power is the ability to turn **water movement into lawful movement**.

---

## Primary Chokepoints

### 1. KNALVOSSAK GATE SYSTEM
**Controller:** Canal Commission + Seal Houses + Order Companies
**Function:** Where fuel becomes legal
**Mechanism:** Lock ladder + registry spine + custody chain

**Why It Matters:**
- Last reliable hardground before Jitknal
- Assay authority determines grade
- Seal authority determines admissibility
- Schedule authority determines who waits

### 2. BRINAV NARROWS (External)
**Controller:** Veskari (Skelur fort-watch)
**Function:** Sea lane choke to outer trade
**Mechanism:** Buoy chain + tick beacons + bond cutters

**Why It Matters:**
- Only reliable passage to non-Salkorin trade
- Tariff extraction point
- "Customs" seizures as economic warfare

### 3. WHITECORD GATE (External)
**Controller:** Selren (Vordketh checkpoint)
**Function:** Land border choke
**Mechanism:** Three-lane system (Clear/Wash/Hold)

**Why It Matters:**
- Controls overland access to Selren markets
- Quarantine authority = admissibility authority
- Blacklist power as diplomatic weapon

### 4. SARNKETH THROAT
**Controller:** Shared (Belt/Knalvossak tension)
**Function:** Quarantine checkpoint for Belt chronomass
**Mechanism:** Touch-legal stamps

**Why It Matters:**
- Late-failure scandals originate here
- Belt vs. City politics crystallize at this point
- Stamp authority = liability assignment

### 5. JITKNAL ENTRIES
**Controller:** Nominally Puljitos; practically contested
**Function:** Grey market access points
**Mechanism:** Posted cuts, drift landings, outstations

**Why It Matters:**
- Bypass for official channels
- High risk, high reward routing
- Enforcement is probabilistic, not certain

|-------|---------|----------|
| **Vosseketh** | Gaturline | First checkpoint approach |
| **Luskil** | Commission | Lock village; queue management |
| **Caskesh** | Seal Houses | Bonded quay intake |

### Within Kronvar Belt

| **Setter benches** | Houses | Raw→Set conversion control |

### Within Brinav March

| **Raskesh** | Local/contested | Alternative export |
| **Night-reed routes** | Smugglers | Unofficial channels |

## Chokepoint Economics

### Value Creation
Chokepoints create value by:
1. **Scarcity:** Limited passage capacity
2. **Verification:** Authority to declare things "real"
3. **Delay:** Time is money; queue position has value
4. **Risk transfer:** Who's liable if something goes wrong?

### Extraction Methods
| Method | Who Benefits |
|--------|--------------|
| **Fees** | Commission, Seal Houses |
| **Priority pricing** | Anyone controlling queue |
| **Seizure percentages** | Order Companies |
| **Insurance requirements** | Everyone in the chain |
| **Stamp/seal charges** | Seal Houses |

## Chokepoint Warfare

### Legal Weapons
| Weapon | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Closure orders** | Stop movement entirely |
| **Admissibility holds** | Make cargo worthless in place |
| **Tariff escalation** | Price out competitors |
| **Blacklisting** | Deny access to entire categories |
| **Rolling closures** | Trap without "targeting" |

### Grey Weapons
| Weapon | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Schedule manipulation** | Conveniently inconvenient timing |
| **Selective enforcement** | Catch some, ignore others |
| **QC laundering** | Use contamination excuses |
| **Outbench rejection** | Refuse stamps from rivals |

---

## Bypass Routes

### Jitknal Labyrinth
**Risk:** Navigation hazard; enforcement probability
**Reward:** Skip Knalvossak entirely
**Evidence:** Gate-log gaps; residue patterns

### March Night Routes
**Risk:** Bloom season contamination; Reedward Patrol
**Reward:** Skip Narrows tariffs
**Evidence:** Bloom film; rot kelp signatures

### Overland (Limited)
**Risk:** Road conditions; Selren patrols
**Reward:** Avoid water chokepoints entirely
**Evidence:** Travel time impossibilities; wrong residue

## Story Applications

| Chokepoint | Story Potential |
|------------|-----------------|
| Gate queue | Desperation, bribery, violence |
| Seal bench | Bureaucratic combat; forged papers |
| Narrows passage | Tariff negotiation; chase |
| Whitecord lanes | Quarantine drama; blacklist consequences |
| Sarnketh | Blame game; scandal exposure |
| Jitknal entry | Risk/reward calculation; navigation peril |
