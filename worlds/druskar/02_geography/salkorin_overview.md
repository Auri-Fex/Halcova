# SALKORIN — Continental Overview

## The Macro Picture

**Salkorin** is the mapped continent where the canal-states matter. It's defined by:
- Cold-shelf geography where roads rot
- Canal systems as the only reliable arteries
- The **Brinav Gulf** (brackwater sea) as the economic heart
- Chronomass as the fuel that makes everything valuable

---

## Climate and Terrain

### Cold Shelf Conditions
- **Roads rot:** Ground conditions make overland transport unreliable
- **Canals work:** Waterways are the only stable infrastructure
- **Seasonal variation:** Bloom seasons affect water quality and commerce

### Water Systems
- **Brinav Gulf:** Brackwater sea; blooms, tariffs, and "customs" legitimacy
- **Canal networks:** Artificial waterways connecting natural water bodies
- **Lock systems:** Elevation changes managed through engineered locks

## Major Polities

### PULJITOS (Primary Arena)
**Position:** Cold shelf; canal-dependent
**Power:** Turns water movement into lawful movement
**Structure:** Five tracts, multiple competing power centers

### VESKARI (External Rival)
**Doctrine:** "Tolls are sovereignty"
**Method:** Tariffs and lawful blockades
**Chokepoint:** Brinav Narrows (Skelur fort-watch)

### SELREN (External Rival)
**Doctrine:** "Clean passage outranks commerce"
**Method:** Quarantine and blacklists
**Chokepoint:** Whitecord Gate (Vordketh checkpoint)

## Strategic Geography

### The Brinav Narrows
**Controller:** Veskari (Skelur fort-watch)
**Function:** Sea lane choke between Brinav Gulf and outer waters
**Method:** Buoy chain + tick beacons define legal channel; bond cutters enforce

### The Whitecord Gate
**Controller:** Selren (Vordketh checkpoint)
**Function:** Land border choke
**Method:** Three lanes (Clear / Wash / Hold); admissibility throttling

### The Jitknal Labyrinth
**Controller:** Nominally Puljitos; practically ungovernable
**Function:** Grey market chronomass source; navigation hazard
**Reality:** Where legal becomes probability

## What Makes Salkorin Different

1. **Water is infrastructure:** Not just transportation but the basis of state power
2. **Chokepoints are policy:** Control a gate, control legitimacy
3. **Bureaucracy is geography:** Where you can get papers stamped determines where you can go
4. **Seasons are economic:** Bloom tiers change the rules of commerce
5. **Evidence is everything:** "Proof over names" runs the whole system
