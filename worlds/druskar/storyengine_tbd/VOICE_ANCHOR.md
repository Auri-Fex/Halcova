# DRUSKAR SAGA — Voice Anchor

## POV Strategy

### Recommended Approach
**Third person limited, rotating POV**

**Rationale:**
- Allows access to multiple faction perspectives
- Maintains tension through limited information
- Enables register shifts through character voice
- Supports political complexity

### POV Rules
1. One POV per chapter (no head-hopping)
2. POV character knows only what they can observe/deduce
3. POV affects vocabulary and technical detail level
4. Emotional state affects perception

## Prose Voice

### Baseline Style
- Concrete sensory detail over abstraction
- Technical vocabulary used naturally (not explained)
- Short sentences for action; longer for reflection
- Active voice dominant

### What to Avoid
- "As you know, Bob" exposition
- Anachronistic vocabulary
- Purple prose
- Over-explaining magic systems

### Sample Baseline
"The assay lantern flickered twice before the wick caught. Mira held it over the cask rim, watching for the telltale darkening that meant residue. Clean. She marked the slate and moved to the next one, forty-six to go before the shift bell."

## Dialogue Voice

### Register Awareness
Characters shift registers based on:
- Who they're speaking to (superior/peer/subordinate)
- Context (formal/professional/casual)
- Stress level (high stress → register errors)
- Deception (wrong register = tell)

### Register Examples

**Stamped (Formal):**
"House Verran acknowledges receipt of Bloom Advisory BA·26·2·14 and will adjust admissibility posture accordingly."

**Trade (Professional):**
"Verran's tightening up on the bloom stuff. Advisory came through this morning—tier two."

**Street (Casual):**
"Verran's getting jumpy about blooms. Watch your cargo."

### Dialogue Markers by Background

| Background | Markers |
|------------|---------|
| Commission clerk | Precise, form-numbers, schedule-conscious |
| Order marshal | Clipped, procedural, evidence-focused |
| Belt House | Production vocabulary, yield-conscious |
| Street/smuggler | Slang-heavy, suffix-dropping, nicknames |
| Veskari | Tariff vocabulary, toll-conscious |
| Selren | Quarantine vocabulary, cleanliness emphasis |

## Description Voice

### Environment
- Functional over beautiful
- Infrastructure as character
- Weather affects operations
- Industrial sounds and smells

**Example:**
"The lock chamber smelled of chainsnail chalk and towbeast sweat. Water sloshed against the gates in the rhythm of the upstream spill—steady, which meant the governors were holding. For now."

### Characters
- Observed details over internal states (for non-POV)
- Clothing indicates role and status
- Equipment tells history
- Physical state shows stress

**Example:**
"Jorek's mantle hung loose at the shoulders—not wear, just a bad fit. Borrowed or scavenged. His boots were better: Gaturline issue, proper for wet stone. Contract work, then, not Order-born."

### Action
- Quick, specific, consequential
- Position and timing matter
- Equipment limits and enables
- Injuries persist

**Example:**
"The Blink went wrong at the third stride. Tarek felt the envelope collapse, momentum suddenly real, and his shoulder hit the gate housing hard enough to spin him. He kept his feet—barely—and heard the mantle-chorus of pursuers snap back into sync behind him."

## Emotional Voice

### How to Convey Emotion
- Physical sensation (gut-twist, throat-tight, vision-narrow)
- Perception shifts (details sharpen or blur)
- Thought patterns (racing, stuck, scattered)
- Behavioral changes (register slips, physical tics)

### What to Avoid
- Naming emotions directly ("he felt angry")
- Melodrama
- Internal monologue info-dumps
- Emotional consistency (stress creates inconsistency)

**Example:**
"The slip said QC·26·114. Mira read it twice, then a third time, as if the letters might rearrange themselves into something less catastrophic. They didn't. Quarantine closure. Her section. Her shift. Her name on the pre-closure read."

---

## Technical Voice

### Magic Systems
- Describe effects, not mechanisms
- Use consistent terminology
- Let readers infer rules from behavior
- Technical detail appropriate to POV expertise

### Bureaucracy
- Slip codes and docket numbers as flavor
- Procedure as obstacle and opportunity
- Paper trails as plot elements
- Forms as weapons

### Forensics
- Evidence described concretely
- Investigation as detective work
- "Proof over names" as philosophy
- Tell details matter
