## KELSAR FAMILY

### TAREK KELSAR
**Full Name (Stamped):** Tarek Kelsar  
**Trade Name:** Tarek Kelsar  
**Street Name:** Tar, Tarek

**Age:** 13  
**Role:** Protagonist (POV)  
**Affiliation:** Independent (grey economy)  
**Primary System:** Time (Rigcraft — Focus/Dwell focus)

**Physical:**
- [TBD based on drafting needs]
- Carries his rig concealed
- Ossir attachment: [collarbone/wrist — TBD]

**Background:**
Son of an unlicensed rig-wright (Dren, deceased) and a trained legal rig-wright (Sava, bonded). Grew up around device work. Started learning the technical side before he could run cargo. After his father's death and mother's enslavement, became the planner and problem-solver for himself and his sister.

**Motivation:**
- **Wants:** To free his mother. To understand what happened to his father.
- **Fears:** Losing Venn. Being too slow to save anyone. Becoming what the system says he is.

**Competencies:**
- Route planning (knows Knalvossak's cuts and timing patterns)
- Rig maintenance and tuning (learned from both parents)
- Focus/Dwell use (can think faster, learn faster, plan in compressed time)
- Reading situations (ossir signals + pattern recognition)
- NOT a fighter (knows it, works around it)

**Limitations:**
- Physical confrontation (he loses)
- Emotional pressure (ossir goes quiet when he needs it most)
- Tendency to overthink when action is needed
- Drift accumulation he doesn't want to acknowledge

**Fortune Relationship:**
- Uses small bends constantly for survival (route timing, attention gaps)
- Has accumulated significant drift toward "escape" outcomes—good at running, bad at standing ground
- Calibrates ossir with micro-bends daily (the trap his mother taught him)
- **Book 1 key moment:** Collection event hits in Chapter 3—constraint tightening during chase
- **Book 1 key moment:** Chooses a dirty claim in Chapter 12—creates trackable signature to survive
- Understands the mechanics intellectually but still falls into the behavioral traps

**Rig Details:**
- Time Rigcraft (Focus/Dwell focus)
- Personal dilation only—cannot create envelopes that affect others
- Built by his father specifically for his temperament
- Not a combat rig; an academic's rig
- Costs: physiological blowback after heavy use (headaches, time-lag confusion)

**Ossir Details:**
- Name: [TBD]
- Timbre: Clean-pitch, analytical
- Sensitivity: Good at Heat trails, pattern discontinuities
- Error mode: Goes quiet under emotional stress
- Calibration habit: Micro-bends for sharpness (learned from mother)

**Arc Direction:**
Book 1: Survivor focused on immediate problems  
Series: Grows into someone willing to stake real things for truth and family

**Voice Notes:**
- Observational internal narration
- Technical vocabulary when thinking about devices/systems
- Shorter sentences under stress
- Avoids direct confrontation in dialogue when possible
- Register shifts when dealing with officials vs. street contacts

### VENN KELSAR
**Full Name (Stamped):** Venn Kelsar  
**Trade Name:** Venn Kelsar  
**Street Name:** Venn

**Age:** 11  
**Role:** Deuteragonist (major supporting)  
**Affiliation:** Independent (grey economy)  
**Primary System:** Density (Rigcraft — redistribution)

**Physical:**
- [TBD based on drafting needs]
- Smaller than peers but moves like she's larger
- Rig worn [TBD — probably torso-integrated]
- Ossir attachment: [belt or wrist — TBD]

**Background:**
Two years younger than Tarek. Learned to fight because their father was often gone and someone had to protect their space in the margins. Natural talent for density rigcraft—the body-sense came easily. More visceral than her brother, more present in the moment.

**Motivation:**
- **Wants:** To hit back. To get their mother free. To stop running.
- **Fears:** Tarek getting hurt because she wasn't fast enough. Becoming trapped like their mother.

**Competencies:**
- Density rigcraft (redistribution for combat moments)
- Street-level violence (knows how to hurt people who try to hurt her)
- Reading immediate threats (ossir tuned for danger)
- Nerve (doesn't freeze when things go wrong)
- Protecting Tarek (her primary function in her own mind)

**Limitations:**
- Impulse control (acts before thinking)
- Strain management (pushes her rig too hard)
- Long-term planning (that's Tarek's job)
- Over-warning ossir when tired (noise instead of signal)

**Fortune Relationship:**
- Uses bends for combat moments—"the hit lands," "I'm faster"
- Has accumulated drift toward "aggression" outcomes—good at fighting, bad at not fighting
- Calibrates ossir with micro-bends (same habit as Tarek, same trap)
- Less aware of her drift than Tarek; doesn't track her bends mentally
- Will take dirty claims without hesitation if the alternative is losing
- Her collection events tend toward direct reversal—she gets hurt doing what she claimed to do well
- Strain management (pushes her rig too hard)
- Long-term planning (that's Tarek's job)
- Over-warning ossir when tired (noise instead of signal)

**Rig Details:**
- Density Rigcraft (redistribution focus)
- Can shift mass within her body—lighter arm, heavier fist; better balance, harder impact
- Does NOT change total mass or volume
- Built by father for her natural body-sense
- Costs: strain, shear risk, recovery time needed

**Ossir Details:**
- Name: [TBD]
- Timbre: Click-train, urgent
- Sensitivity: Immediate threats, density work detection
- Error mode: Over-warns when tired
- Calibration habit: Micro-bends (same as Tarek, learned from mother)

**Arc Direction:**
Book 1: Reactive fighter, protector mode  
Series: Learns to choose her battles instead of taking all of them

**Voice Notes (as perceived by Tarek):**
- Direct speech, few wasted words
- Physical communication (gestures, positioning)
- More register-fluid than Tarek (adapts faster to context)
- Says things Tarek is thinking but won't say

## PARENTS

### DREN KELSAR (deceased)
**Full Name (Stamped):** Dren Kelsar  
**Trade Name:** Dren Kelsar  
**Street Name:** Dren, "the Wright"

**Status:** Deceased (six months before story begins)  
**Cause:** Officially equipment failure. Actually murdered.  
**Role:** Unlicensed rig-wright. Built children's rigs. Found something dangerous.

**Background:**
Skilled rig-wright who never got licensed—possibly couldn't afford it, possibly chose to stay outside the system. Worked the grey market. Built and repaired rigs for people who couldn't or wouldn't go through official channels. Good enough that people sought him out. Careful enough that he survived for years.

**What he found:**
[To be developed through series]
- Evidence of something House Ornan wanted buried
- Important enough to kill for
- Connected to experimental chronomass work

**Legacy:**
- The rigs Tarek and Venn carry
- The skills Tarek has for maintenance/tuning
- The knowledge that got him killed
- House Ornan’s intercepted Fortune debt and predatory contract that enslaved his wife

### SAVA KELSAR (bonded labor)
**Full Name (Stamped):** Sava Kelsar  
**Trade Name:** Sava Kelsar  

**Status:** Bonded labor to House Ornan  
**Duration:** Four months into contract (started two months after Dren's death)  
**Condition:** Deteriorating. The work is killing her.

**Background:**
One of the few legally licensed rig-wrights. Her skills were the real target—House Ornan wanted her expertise and manufactured a Claim to get it. She taught her children everything she could before she was taken: rig maintenance, ossir calibration, how to read the city.

**Current situation:**
- Working on House Ornan's experimental projects
- Heavily supervised, limited contact with outside
- Physical and mental strain accumulating
- Children have limited information about her condition

**Role in series:**
- The reason for everything
- Living proof of what Claims can cost
- Source of information when contact is possible
- Her rescue is the series goal
