## Sample Tone Passages

**Action:**
"The Blink came wrong—too shallow, envelope collapsing before he cleared the gate. Tarek felt the snap as normal time reasserted, momentum suddenly real, and hit the wet stones harder than he'd hit anything in years. Behind him, the mantle-chorus of Gaturline marshals thrummed back into sync."

**Procedure:**
"The slip read QC·26·114, which meant quarantine class, which meant Verran would want assay reads within six ticks of any lot that touched the affected cuts. Mira did the math: forty-seven casks in the yard, three burners on shift. They'd be reading by lantern-light until dawn."

**Politics:**
"House Ornan's experimental starters had cut Belt yields by a third. House Velt called it reckless. House Kivren called it an opportunity. The Commission called it a reason to tighten assay thresholds, which meant more work for Knalvossak benches and less margin for everyone else. The math was obvious. The solution wasn't."
