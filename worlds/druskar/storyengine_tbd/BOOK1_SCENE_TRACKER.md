## FORTUNE ECONOMICS THROUGH-LINE

### What the Reader Should Understand by End of Book 1

1. **Small bends accumulate** — The siblings' survival routine has created debt
2. **Collection is mechanical** — Not punishment, just accounting
3. **Dirty claims are trackable** — Tarek's choice in Chapter 12 has consequences
4. **The system rewards risk until it destroys you** — The behavioral trap is real
5. **Visibility changes the game** — Public exposure creates different rules
6. **House Ornan understands all of this** — They're not just brutes; they're claim-counter specialists

### What Carries Into Book 2

- Tarek's dirty claim signature is still readable
- Both siblings have drift patterns that will cause problems
- Ornan’s converted contract shows backdated amendments and inflated valuations
- Ornan's counter-tactics will escalate
