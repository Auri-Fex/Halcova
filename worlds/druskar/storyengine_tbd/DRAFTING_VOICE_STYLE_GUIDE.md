# DRUSKAR — Drafting Voice & Style Reference

## Purpose
This is the **working reference** for maintaining consistent voice, style, and tone while drafting prose. Keep this open while writing.

---

## THE DRUSKAR VOICE (Quick Reference)

### What It Is
- **Concrete over abstract** — Show the resin fracture, don't explain seal theory
- **Procedural without being dry** — Bureaucracy has teeth; make them bite
- **Gritty without nihilism** — Things cost; hope requires work
- **Technical vocabulary lived-in** — Characters don't explain their world to each other

### What It Isn't
- Exposition dumps ("As you know, the three systems...")
- Purple prose (save the poetry for funerals)
- Quippy/Marvel-style dialogue
- Omniscient authorial commentary

---

## PROSE MECHANICS

### Sentence Structure
**Action:** Short, punchy, verb-forward
> The Blink collapsed. Tarek hit stone. His shoulder screamed.

**Procedure:** Medium length, cause-and-effect chain
> The slip read QC·26·114, which meant assay reads within six ticks, which meant Mira's section would be running lanterns until the board rail stopped accepting posts.

**Reflection:** Longer, more interior, can breathe
> He'd known the Claim was coming. Everyone knew, eventually. But knowing it and feeling the weight settle into his chest like cold water were different things entirely.

### Paragraph Rhythm
- Vary length: short punches, medium development, occasional longer breath
- End paragraphs on consequence or tension, not description
- One idea per paragraph in action; can layer in reflection

### Word Choice
- **Prefer:** Anglo-Saxon roots, technical terms used casually, concrete nouns
- **Avoid:** Latinate abstractions, adverbs (especially "-ly"), words that explain emotion

**Instead of:** He angrily slammed his fist on the table in frustration.
**Write:** His fist hit the table. The ledger jumped.

## DIALOGUE PRINCIPLES

### Register Awareness (Critical)
Characters shift register based on context. This is **not optional**.

| Context | Register | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Official document | Stamped | "House Verran acknowledges receipt of Closure Order CO·26·QC·7." |
| Professional conversation | Trade | "Verran's going tight on the bloom stuff. Advisory this morning." |
| Casual/stress | Street | "Verran's jumpy. Watch your cargo." |

### Register as Character Signal
- **Wrong register for context** → Outsider, nervous, deceptive, or disrespectful
- **Register slip under stress** → Real emotion breaking through
- **Code-switching** → Competent adaptation to social context

### Dialogue Markers by Background

| Background | Verbal Markers |
|------------|----------------|
| Commission clerk | Tick-counts, docket numbers, schedule references |
| Order marshal | Procedural language, evidence focus, clipped sentences |
| Belt House | Yields, grades, starter vocabulary |
| Street/smuggler | Slang, suffix-dropping, nicknames |
| Assay professional | Grade states, residue vocabulary, burn metaphors |

### Dialogue Rhythm
- People interrupt and overlap
- Complete sentences are formal; fragments are natural
- Questions often aren't answered directly
- Subtext matters more than text

**Bad:**
> "What happened at the gate?"
> "The convoy was delayed because of a QC closure. The assay showed residue."

**Better:**
> "The gate?"
> "QC'd." A shrug. "Residue on the lead cask. Verran wouldn't touch it."
> "How much residue?"
> "Enough."

---

## DESCRIPTION APPROACH

### Environment as Character
The canals, gates, and bureaucratic infrastructure aren't backdrop—they're participants.

**Instead of:** The gate was large and imposing.
**Write:** The gate teeth were seated, which meant traffic was stopped, which meant someone was paying for every tick of delay. Mira counted the barges backed up behind the closure board. Fourteen. At standard demurrage, someone would be bleeding by nightfall.

### Sensory Priority
1. **Sound** — Echoes on stone, chain rattle, water slap, the chorus of mantles
2. **Smell** — Brackwater, blekkult vapor, wickmold soot, towbeast sweat
3. **Touch** — Wet stone, residue grit, resin fracture edge, tremor-numb fingers
4. **Sight** — Functional details, not scenic beauty
5. **Taste** — Rare; save for impact (blood, contamination, rot kelp confusion)

### Weather and Time
- Weather affects operations (fog delays, freeze risk, bloom humidity)
- Time measured in ticks, not hours
- Seasons are bloom tiers and work schedules, not poetry

---

## ACTION SEQUENCE STYLE

### Pacing
- **Before:** Build tension through constraint awareness (low reserves, closing window, limited escape routes)
- **During:** Short sentences, present-tense feeling, specific body mechanics
- **After:** Consequences persist (injuries, evidence, witnesses, resource depletion)

### Chronomass Action (Blink/Envelope)
- Describe entry: the moment of commitment, the world slowing
- Inside: the strange clarity, the cost ticking
- Exit: the snap back, disorientation, residue tells

**Example:**
> The mantle chorus behind him synced. Three, maybe four marshals, all comparatively-active. That was the problem with Gaturline—they could afford the burn.
> 
> Tarek reached. The envelope came up ragged, ¾ reserve and falling. The world slowed to amber.
> 
> Ten strides to the cut. Inside the envelope, he could see the splash patterns where his boots would hit standing water, calculate the angle through the narrows. Outside, the marshals would see him blur.
> 
> He moved.
> 
> The envelope collapsed three strides early. He hit the corner wrong, shoulder into stone, momentum suddenly real. The mantled marshals snapped back into normal time behind him, already triangulating.

### Density Action (Rigcraft/Transfer Mate)
- Rigcraft: internal sensation of shifting weight, brief windows of advantage
- Transfer Mates: contact confirmation, transfer initiation, heat vent, evidence creation

### Oddswork Action
- Fortune spending: the feeling of tilting probability, the immediate Heat
- Claim settlement: the cruel timing, the "of course it's now" realization

---

## INVESTIGATION SCENES

### Evidence Discovery
- Physical observation first
- Deduction follows (character thinking through implications)
- Questions raised matter as much as questions answered

**Pattern:**
> What they see → What it means → What's still unknown → What to do next

### Interview/Interrogation
- Subtext layer: what questions aren't being asked?
- Register shifts signal trust/distrust
- Lies are usually true statements missing context

---

## POLITICAL SCENES

### Power Dynamics
- Who has what leverage?
- What's the cost of each option?
- Who's watching this conversation?

### Coalition/Negotiation
- Everyone wants something
- Offers have costs; refusals have costs
- The deal isn't done until the paperwork is filed

---

## EMOTIONAL BEATS

### Conveying Emotion (Show, Don't Label)
**Physical sensation:**
> His gut twisted. vs. He felt anxious.

**Perception shift:**
> The ledger numbers blurred. vs. He was distracted.

**Behavioral change:**
> She answered in Trade when Stamped was expected. vs. She was uncomfortable.

### Quiet Moments
- Rare; earn them with preceding tension
- Interior reflection allowed
- Often interrupted (this is not a restful world)

---

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### Exposition Problems
- ❌ "As you know, Bob" dialogue
- ❌ Narrator explaining how magic works
- ❌ Historical info-dumps
- ✓ Details emerge through use and consequence

### Tone Problems
- ❌ Quippy humor in tension moments
- ❌ Grimdark nihilism (nothing matters)
- ❌ Melodrama (everything is the worst)
- ✓ Stakes feel real; outcomes feel earned

### Technical Problems
- ❌ Magic that doesn't follow established rules
- ❌ Evidence that appears without source
- ❌ Travel times that ignore geography
- ✓ Consistency in system mechanics and world logic

### Dialogue Problems
- ❌ Everyone sounds the same
- ❌ Speeches instead of conversation
- ❌ Explaining things to people who'd know them
- ✓ Register variation, subtext, interruption, fragment

## SAMPLE PASSAGES (Reference Anchors)

### Action Anchor
> The Blink came wrong—too shallow, envelope collapsing before he cleared the gate. Tarek felt the snap as normal time reasserted, momentum suddenly real, and hit the wet stones harder than he'd hit anything in years. Behind him, the mantle-chorus of Gaturline marshals thrummed back into sync.
> 
> He rolled. Bad shoulder, worse angle, but roll or die. Something cracked—rib or stone, didn't matter which. The first marshal was already moving, residue cuffs out, the procedural litany starting before Tarek could get his feet under him.
> 
> "By authority of contract—"
> 
> Tarek ran.

### Procedure Anchor
> The slip read QC·26·114, which meant quarantine class, which meant Verran would want assay reads within six ticks of any lot that touched the affected cuts. Mira did the math: forty-seven casks in the yard, three burners on shift. They'd be reading by lantern-light until dawn.
> 
> "Brin Gauge?"
> 
> Kavel checked the posted strip. "Up two since morning. Three by nightfall if it holds."
> 
> "It won't hold." Mira marked her slate. "Pull the bloom protocol kit. We're going Tier 2 before the board admits it."

### Politics Anchor
> House Ornan's experimental starters had cut Belt yields by a third. House Velt called it reckless. House Kivren called it an opportunity. The Commission called it a reason to tighten assay thresholds, which meant more work for Knalvossak benches and less margin for everyone else.
> 
> "The yields will recover," Ornan's man said. Young, confident, wearing House colors like armor. "Sixth-generation starters always—"
> 
> "Fifth-generation starters killed three bench workers in Sarnketh." The Velt patriarch didn't raise his voice. He didn't need to. "Sixth-generation hasn't been tested outside controlled conditions."
> 
> "Which is why we need the variance—"
> 
> "No."

### Quiet Anchor
> The wick heater sputtered. Wickmold getting thin—he'd need to buy a fresh block before the next cold snap, assuming he still had credit with the fuel ward.
> 
> Assuming he was still here.
> 
> The Claim had settled that morning. Not the worst timing—he'd been awake, at least, and alone. But the thing about Claims was that they clustered. Where there was one, there were more. And the weight of it, the knowledge that the universe had marked you for payment, made everything else feel thin.
> 
> He watched the wick flame steady itself and tried to remember what clean Fortune felt like.
