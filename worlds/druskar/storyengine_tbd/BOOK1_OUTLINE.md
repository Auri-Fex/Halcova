## One-Sentence Summary

Tarek and Venn Kelsar's routine cargo run goes wrong when they're recognized by someone who knew their father—and wanted him dead—forcing them to run, fight, and discover that a legitimate Fortune debt was intercepted and converted into a predatory contract that trapped their mother.

---

## Opening State

### Political Context
- House Ornan expanding influence in the Kronvar Belt
- Tension between Belt Houses and Knalvossak's monopoly on assay authority
- Grey market thriving because official channels are slow and expensive

### Economic Context  
- Chronomass prices volatile (experimental work affecting yields)
- Insurance markets stressed
- Good time to be a grey runner if you're fast and quiet

### Personal Context (Kelsars)
- Six months since Dren's death
- Four months since Sava's bonding
- Tarek and Venn have established a survival routine
- They're looking for proof Ornan trapped Sava with predatory contract terms but haven't found it
- They're running low on hope

---

## The Inciting Job

### Setup
Tarek and Venn are offered a job through their usual grey contact: move a sealed case from Caskesh (bonded quays) to Jitesh (drift landing) without going through assay. Simple enough. Pays well. Timing is tight.

### What they think it is
- Unassayed chronomass (their usual work)
- Someone avoiding tariffs or delays
- Routine grey cargo

### What it actually is
- Documents, not chronomass
- Evidence connected to House Ornan
- Someone is trying to move proof out of Knalvossak
- The pickup was watched

### The Complication
At the handoff, someone recognizes Tarek. Not as a runner—as Dren Kelsar's son.

The recognition triggers a response. People come for them. Not gate guards or Order marshals. House muscle. The kind who don't file paperwork.

## Act Structure (Rough)

### ACT 1: The Run (Chapters 1-4)

**Chapter 1: The Job**
- Establish Tarek and Venn's routine
- Show their living situation, their dynamic, their skills
- The job offer comes through their contact
- Decision to take it

**Chapter 2: The Pickup**
- Moving through Knalvossak (show the city)
- The handoff at Caskesh
- Something feels off (ossir signals, observed but can't pinpoint)
- They get the case and move

**Chapter 3: The Recognition**
- En route to delivery
- Intercepted by someone who shouldn't know their route
- "You're Dren's boy."
- Fight/flight sequence
- Venn's rig use (density combat)
- **COLLECTION EVENT:** Tarek's accumulated micro-bends from months of grey running choose NOW to settle—constraint tightening. The door that should be unlocked isn't. The alley that should be clear has someone in it. Every easy exit closes. He feels his ossir go loud with collection pressure.
- They escape but barely—and Tarek realizes their Fortune debt is coming due

**Chapter 4: The Fallout**
- They can't make the delivery
- They can't go to their usual safe spots
- They open the case
- Inside: documents about House Ornan. Including references to their father.

**First Plot Point:**
The documents reference a "Kelsar audit" that was supposed to be destroyed. Their father wasn't just investigating—he did a formal audit of something. And someone in House Ornan signed off on his death.

---

### ACT 2A: Running and Learning (Chapters 5-8)

**Chapter 5: Going Dark**
- Finding new shelter (someone their father knew? A contact's contact?)
- Processing what they found
- First look at the documents: financial records, audit notes, names
- They don't understand all of it, but they understand enough

**Chapter 6: The Debt Transfer Connection**
- Cross-referencing what they found
- Documents point to an intercepted Fortune debt converted into a labor contract with inflated terms
- Same signatories. Same timing. This was coordinated.
- First real hope: if they can prove this, the contract can be voided

**Chapter 7: The Reach**
- House Ornan is looking for them harder now
- They're not just runners who saw something—they're Kelsar's children
- Someone tries to buy them off (come in quietly, we'll make this go away)
- They refuse

**Chapter 8: The Source**
- They track down who sent the documents
- Someone inside House Ornan who's scared
- This person knew their father. Helped with the audit.
- Reveals: Dren found evidence of experimental work that's killing people. Belt workers. The yield failures everyone blames on "starter problems" are cover for something worse.

**Midpoint:**
The contact gives them a location—where more proof is hidden. But getting there means going into Ornan territory. Into the Belt.

---

### ACT 2B: The Choice (Chapters 9-12)

**Chapter 9: The Decision**
- They can take what they have to the Seal Houses. It might be enough to raise questions.
- Or they can get more proof. Enough to actually free their mother.
- Venn wants to go. Tarek knows the risks.
- They go.

**Chapter 10: Belt Country**
- Moving through Kronvar territory
- Different rules, different dangers
- Tarek's Focus rig useful for learning patterns, timing
- Venn on edge—too many threats, ossir over-warning

**Chapter 11: The Cache**
- They find where their father hid backup proof
- It's worse than they thought: test subjects. Workers who came in healthy and came out broken. Records of who and when.
- Their mother is working in the same facility.

**Chapter 12: Caught**
- House Ornan anticipated this
- The trap closes
- Fight sequence (Venn's density work pushed hard)
- **THE CLEAN/DIRTY DECISION:** Tarek faces a choice:
  - **Clean claim:** "We get lucky enough to find A way out" — broad, settles fast, light residue, but might not be enough
  - **Dirty claim:** "The specific guard on the east door looks away for exactly six seconds" — wins the moment, but creates a trackable signature Ornan can follow
  - **He chooses dirty.** They need to survive. He'll deal with being hunted later.
- Tarek has to use Focus in a crisis (think his way through the consequences of his choice)
- They escape with the proof but not clean—they're hurt, they're marked, and now Ornan's instruments have a lock on Tarek's claim signature

**Dark Moment:**
They have the evidence. But House Ornan knows they have it. Their faces are known. Their mother is still inside and now Ornan knows she's leverage. They can't go to the authorities without putting her at greater risk.

---

### ACT 3: The Gambit (Chapters 13-16)

**Chapter 13: Allies**
- They need help. Can't do this alone.
- Their grey contact comes through with a connection
- Someone who hates House Ornan for their own reasons
- Alliance of convenience formed

**Chapter 14: The Plan**
- They can't take down House Ornan with what they have—not yet
- But they can make it public that questions exist
- Force an official audit. Force Seal House involvement.
- Create protection by creating visibility

**Chapter 15: The Move**
- Executing the plan
- Getting the evidence into the right hands
- House Ornan tries to stop them
- Action sequence: chase through Knalvossak, using everything they've learned
- Venn fighting, Tarek thinking

**Chapter 16: The Aftermath**
- The evidence reaches a Seal House (Verran? Someone outside House Ornan's influence)
- Official questions are raised
- House Ornan can't touch the Kelsars openly now—too visible
- But their mother is still bonded. The contract still stands.
- The proof they have questions the contract but doesn't void it. Yet.

**Resolution:**
They've survived. They've learned the truth. They've created protection through visibility. But:
- Their mother is still trapped
- House Ornan is still dangerous
- The larger conspiracy (what Dren found about the experimental work) is still hidden
- They have allies now, but also more enemies
- This was round one. They're still in the fight.

## Character Arcs (Book 1)

### Tarek
**Starts:** Surviving day to day, protecting the routine, hoping for proof  
**Learns:** His father was a hero who died trying to expose monsters  
**Ends:** Committed to finishing what Dren started, even knowing the cost

### Venn
**Starts:** Fighting whatever's in front of her, reactive protection  
**Learns:** Some fights can't be won with fists; some can't be won without them  
**Ends:** Understands the long game but still ready to throw down

---

## System Integration

### Fortune (ever-present)
- Multiple small bends throughout for survival moments
- **Chapter 3: COLLECTION EVENT** — Constraint tightening hits Tarek mid-chase; accumulated micro-bends settle at worst moment
- **Chapter 12: CLEAN/DIRTY DECISION** — Tarek chooses a dirty claim to escape; creates trackable signature
- Drift accumulation shown (their luck biasing toward escape routes, away from confrontation)
- The ossir calibration habit as ongoing behavior (and as part of the trap)
- **Ornan uses claim-counter tactics throughout:** controlled spaces, disciplined crews, noise/decoys, residue tracking, moral hazard baiting

### Time (Tarek's rig)
- Focus/Dwell used for learning, planning, perception
- At least one crisis use where he has to think his way out
- Physiological cost shown (post-use headaches, time-lag)

### Density (Venn's rig)
- Combat redistribution in multiple fights
- Strain shown (she pushes too hard at least once)
- Recovery time as limitation

### Ossirs
- Tarek's going quiet under stress (at worst moment)
- Venn's over-warning when tired
- Calibration habit shown (micro-bends)
- Signal reading as learned skill

---

## Location Focus

**Primary:** Knalvossak metro ring  
- Caskesh (bonded quays) — the pickup
- Jitesh (drift landing) — intended delivery
- Street-level Knalvossak — chase sequences
- Margins living spaces — their home situation

**Secondary:** Kronvar Belt  
- Ornan territory — the cache location
- Different feel from city

---

## Evidence Trail

**Created during Book 1:**
- The documents they intercepted
- The cache of proof from Dren's hiding spot
- Whatever they leave behind in escapes

**Discovered during Book 1:**
- Predatory debt transfer paperwork and backdated amendments
- The audit their father conducted
- The experimental work records

**Left for future books:**
- Full scope of experimental chronomass work
- Who else is involved beyond House Ornan
- How to actually void the contract and clear the debt

---

## Hooks for Book 2

- House Ornan is damaged but not destroyed
- Mother still bonded, possibly in more danger
- The inside contact (potential ally or liability)
- The larger conspiracy only partially revealed
- Their new visibility is protection but also limitation
