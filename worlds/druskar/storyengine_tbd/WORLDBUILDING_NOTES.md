# DRUSKAR SAGA — Worldbuilding Notes

## Design Philosophy Notes

### Why This World Works
1. **Chokepoints create drama** — Control a gate, control legitimacy
2. **Bureaucracy has teeth** — Forms aren't boring when they're weapons
3. **Evidence matters** — "Proof over names" makes investigation meaningful
4. **Systems have costs** — No free power; every advantage has a price
5. **External pressure maintains tension** — Veskari and Selren keep Puljitos mean

### Tonal Balance
- Gritty but not nihilistic
- Procedural but not dry
- Political but not incomprehensible
- Magical but not whimsical
