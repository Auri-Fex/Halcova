# DRUSKAR SAGA — Antagonist Profiles

## Antagonist Philosophy

In Druskar, antagonists aren't evil—they're **competing interests** with incompatible goals. The best antagonists:
- Have legitimate grievances
- Use the system as weapon
- Leave evidence trails
- Create problems that can't be punched away

## INDIVIDUAL ANTAGONISTS

### HOUSE ORNAN (Institutional + Individual)

**Position:** Belt House. Kronvar territory. Experimental chronomass starter work.  
**Public Face:** Innovative, ambitious, pushing chronomass yields for Puljitos prosperity  
**Reality:** Willing to kill to protect secrets. Forges Claims to acquire skilled labor. Poisoning workers with experimental processes.

---

#### ORNAN TACTICAL DOCTRINE (Claim-Counter Operations)

House Ornan doesn't just have money and muscle. **They understand Fortune mechanics** and use them systematically to hunt people who rely on luck.

**Five Counter-Tactics:**

| Tactic | Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Force controlled spaces** | Herd targets into predictable locations | Claims seat harder, become dirty and trackable |
| **Reduce uncertainty** | Professional crews, disciplined procedures | No "lucky" gaps to exploit |
| **Add noise/decoys** | Multiple pursuit vectors, false trails | Claim anchoring becomes unreliable |
| **Track residue** | House ossirs, tuned instruments | Every dirty claim marks the target |
| **Create moral hazard** | Pressure targets into repeated claiming | Let collection hit when target is depleted |

**Applied to the Kelsars:**
- Chapter 3: Ornan crews don't leave gaps; the recognition triggers immediate coordinated response
- Chapter 7: The "buy them off" offer is moral hazard—designed to make them relax and claim-deplete
- Chapter 12: The trap at the cache is a controlled space; Tarek's dirty claim is exactly what they wanted

---

#### ORNAN ENFORCEMENT LEAD: [NAME TBD]

**Role:** The hunter who understands Fortune warfare  
**Background:** Former Order Company officer who learned claim-tracking on the job  
**Method:** Patient, systematic, understands that Fortune users defeat themselves if you wait  
**Relationship to Kelsars:** Professional. Not personal. Just doing the job.

**Tactical Notes:**
- Carries tuned ossir specifically calibrated for claim signatures
- Knows that young runners over-claim when scared
- Will let targets escape once or twice to mark them with dirty claims
- Closes the trap when collection pressure is high

---

#### ORNAN INSIDE CONTACT: [NAME TBD]

**Role:** The scared one who helped Dren, now helping the kids  
**Background:** Junior auditor who assisted Dren's investigation; didn't realize what they were documenting until too late  
**Method:** Information drops, carefully timed; terrified of discovery  
**Relationship to Kelsars:** Guilt-driven. Knew their father. Feels responsible.

**Why they help:**
- Saw what Ornan did to Dren
- Knows Sava is in the same facility that's killing workers
- Can't live with it but can't openly fight

**Risk to Kelsars:**
- Every contact is a potential leak
- Ornan knows there's a mole; hunting systematically
- Contact's fear may lead to betrayal or disappearance

---

#### ORNAN HOUSE HEAD: [NAME TBD]

**Role:** The authority who ordered Dren's death  
**Background:** Third-generation Belt House leadership; believes in "progress"  
**Method:** Never directly dirty; insulated by layers of deniability  
**Relationship to Kelsars:** Doesn't know their names. They're a file number.

**Philosophy:**
- The experimental work is worth the cost
- Workers are replaceable; innovation isn't
- Dren was a threat to years of investment
- The children are a cleanup problem, not a vendetta

---

### [ADDITIONAL ANTAGONISTS TO BE DEVELOPED]

**Antagonist archetypes to consider:**
- Corrupt Commission clerk (sells closures)
- Ambitious House scion (wants monopoly)
- Order Captain with side business (selective enforcement)
- Smuggler kingpin (controls Jitknal routes)
- Veskari customs officer (legal piracy)
- Selren admissibility judge (political blacklisting)

## ANTAGONIST DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Making Antagonists Compelling
- Give them a point (they're not wrong about everything)
- Make their methods logical (within their worldview)
- Create evidence of their actions (forensics work both ways)
- Let them win sometimes (raises stakes)

### Institutional vs. Personal
- **Institutional:** The system working as designed, against protagonists
- **Personal:** Individual using system for personal gain
- **Hybrid:** Personal ambition amplified by institutional power

### Evidence Trails
Every antagonist action should create:
- Documents (slips, stamps, logs)
- Physical evidence (residue, wear, geometry tells)
- Witnesses (who saw what, when)
- Timing patterns (schedule correlations)
