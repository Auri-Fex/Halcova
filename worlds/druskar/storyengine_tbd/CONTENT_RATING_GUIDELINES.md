## VIOLENCE GUIDELINES

### Permitted
| Element | Handling | Frequency |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Combat/fighting | Consequential, not gratuitous; injuries persist | Moderate |
| Chase sequences | Tension-driven, physical stakes | Frequent |
| Threat of violence | Used for tension; not torture-porn | As needed |
| Character injury | Shown with consequence; recovery matters | Moderate |
| Death (off-page) | Referenced, implied, aftermath shown | Occasional |
| Death (on-page) | Quick, not lingered on; emotional weight | Rare |

### Not Permitted
- Torture scenes depicted in detail
- Gore/dismemberment described graphically
- Violence against children depicted graphically (threat is okay)
- Sexual violence (can be implied in backstory, never depicted)

### Violence Philosophy
Violence should feel **real and costly**, not exciting or triumphant. When Venn fights, she gets hurt. When someone dies, it matters. The noir tone comes from consequence, not graphic content.

## LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

### Permitted
| Element | Handling |
|---------|----------|
| Invented profanity | World-specific curses preferred |
| Mild real profanity | Damn, hell, bastard — sparingly |
| Intense emotional language | "I'll kill you" as threat, not literal |

### Not Permitted
- F-bombs or sexual profanity
- Slurs of any kind
- Excessive profanity that reads as adult

### Language Philosophy
Street register dialogue can be rough without being explicit. Invented profanity (world-specific curses) adds flavor without content concerns.

## DARK THEMES GUIDELINES

### Permitted (Core to Story)
| Theme | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| Parent death | Central to plot; grief shown honestly |
| Parent enslavement | Central to plot; hope for rescue |
| Child labor/survival | Protagonists work to survive; shown as wrong |
| Systemic injustice | Core theme; protagonists fight against it |
| Grief and loss | Handled with emotional honesty |
| Moral complexity | Characters make hard choices |
| Exploitation | Shown as evil; protagonists resist |

### Handled Carefully
| Theme | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Despair | Always balanced with agency/hope |
| Trauma | Present but not wallowed in |
| Betrayal | Shown but not nihilistic |
| Death of named characters | Meaningful, not shock value |

### Not Permitted
- Nihilism as conclusion (hope must survive)
- Child death depicted graphically
- Suicide depicted or ideated
- Self-harm depicted

### Dark Theme Philosophy
This is **dark fantasy with hope**, not grimdark. The world is hard, the system is unjust, but the protagonists have agency. They fight back. They matter. Readers should feel tension and fear, not despair.

---

## ROMANCE/RELATIONSHIP GUIDELINES

### Permitted
| Element | Handling |
|---------|----------|
| Sibling bond | Central relationship; protective, complex |
| Found family | Allies become family |
| Crushes/attraction | Age-appropriate, not central to plot |
| Hand-holding, hugs | Natural expressions of connection |

### Not Permitted
- Romantic/sexual content beyond hand-holding
- Age-inappropriate relationships
- Romance as primary plot driver (this is action/adventure)

### Relationship Philosophy
Tarek is 13, Venn is 11. Romance is not the focus. Family is.

---

## SUBSTANCE USE GUIDELINES

### Permitted
| Element | Handling |
|---------|----------|
| Chronomass as dangerous substance | Central to world; consequences shown |
| Adults drinking | Background, not focus |
| Addiction metaphor (Fortune) | Behavioral, not substance |

### Not Permitted
- Protagonists using recreational substances
- Drug use depicted positively
- Detailed depiction of intoxication

---

## CONTENT CHECKLIST (Per Chapter)

Before finalizing any chapter, verify:

- [ ] Violence has consequence, not spectacle
- [ ] No graphic gore or torture
- [ ] Language appropriate for upper YA
- [ ] Dark themes balanced with agency
- [ ] No nihilistic conclusions
- [ ] Relationship content age-appropriate
- [ ] Systemic injustice shown as wrong, not normalized

---

## SENSITIVITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Handle With Care
| Topic | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Bonded labor (slavery parallel) | Shown as evil; protagonists fight against |
| Economic exploitation | Systemic, not individual villainy |
| Family separation | Central trauma; hope for reunion |
| Child vulnerability | Protagonists have agency despite circumstances |

### Consultation Recommended
- If depicting cultures/backgrounds outside author experience
- If trauma depiction feels uncertain
- If violence level feels borderline
