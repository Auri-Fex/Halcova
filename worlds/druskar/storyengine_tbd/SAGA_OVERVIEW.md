## Thematic Pillars (How They Apply)

**Law vs Oath vs Hospitality:**
- *Law:* The Commission, the Seal Houses, the procedures that trap Sava
- *Oath:* Fortune Claims—Sava's wager was real; the universe logged it
- *Hospitality (absent):* The siblings survive in a world with no free shelter

**Artifice vs Soul:**
- *Artifice:* Devices, rigs, forged documents—how the system operates
- *Soul:* The siblings' authentic bond; their father's conscience; what bleeds through the paperwork

**Central Question:** *Can you fight a system that's designed to make fighting cost more than compliance?*

## One-Sentence Summary

Thirteen-year-old Tarek Kelsar and his fighter sister Venn run grey cargo in Knalvossak to survive after their father's murder and their mother's enslavement—until a job gone wrong reveals their father was killed for what he discovered, and the same people now want them.

## The Kelsar Family

### Tarek Kelsar (13) — POV
**Role:** Problem-solver, technical, academic  
**Rig:** Time (Focus/Dwell focus) — personal dilation for thinking, not combat  
**Ossir:** Clean-pitch, analytical. Good at Heat trails. Goes quiet under emotional stress.  
**Function:** Plans routes, solves problems, understands how things work  
**Arc:** From survivor to someone willing to risk everything for truth

### Venn Kelsar (11)
**Role:** Fighter, instinct, nerve  
**Rig:** Density (Rigcraft redistribution) — combat moments, body-cost  
**Ossir:** Click-train, urgent. Over-warns when tired.  
**Function:** Handles what happens when plans fail  
**Arc:** From reactive fighter to someone who chooses her battles

### Dren Kelsar (deceased)
**Role:** Father, unlicensed rig-wright  
**Death:** Six months before story begins. Ruled accident. Was murdered.  
**Legacy:** Built the siblings' rigs. Found something dangerous.

### Sava Kelsar (bonded labor)
**Role:** Mother, trained rig-wright (one of few legal ones)  
**Status:** Bonded to House Ornan via intercepted Fortune debt (predatory collection)  
**Condition:** Deteriorating. The work is killing her.

## The Conflict Layers

### Immediate: Survival
- Grey cargo running to eat
- Staying off official notice (unlicensed rigs = seizure)
- Avoiding the people who killed their father

### Personal: Family
- Mother trapped in House Ornan
- Father's death unresolved
- The siblings only have each other

### Mystery: The Truth
- Father didn't make the stake that enslaved their mother—documents forged
- Father was investigating something before he died
- He was killed to stop him; the Claim was the cover-up

### Systemic: House Ornan
- Belt House with experimental chronomass work
- Aggressive, expanding, willing to destroy a family
- What are they protecting? What did Dren find?

---

## The Fortune Economy (Series Throughline)

**Universal presence:** Everyone has Fortune. Everyone uses it. Everyone pays for it.

**The siblings' relationship with Fortune:**
- They use small bends to survive (grey cargo work needs luck)
- They calibrate their ossirs with micro-bends (the habit their mother taught them)
- They're both starting to feel drift (luck biasing in ways they don't control)
- They know—viscerally—what Claims can cost (their mother's freedom)

**The behavioral economics hook:**
- Every bend is a choice
- Small bends feel free but accumulate
- The system rewards risk-taking until it destroys you
- "Just one more" is how people lose everything

---

## The Intercepted Debt (Series Engine)

**Sava’s original wager and debt:**

- Sava made a legitimate high-stakes wager with her ossir (to save the family during a crisis). She lost. The obligation was logged for collection.
- House Ornan intercepted the collection — they “paid” the debt and converted it into a labor contract with Sava.
- The predation is not the wager itself; it’s the inflated, extended, and falsified terms Ornan enforces to prevent payoff.

**Claim/Contract fields Ornan manipulates:**

| Field | What It Says | The Forgery |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Subject** | Sava Kelsar (original obligor) | Ornan adds co-liability, post-dating Dren |
| **Scope** | Labor until “debt cleared” | Amounts inflated via falsified valuations |
| **Vector** | Original wager loss logged by ossir | Ornan misstates trigger causes (e.g., chronomass “accident”) |
| **Anchor** | Contract routing (employer/house) | Home and routes added as leverage without consent |
| **Maturity** | Should be finite, stated window | Converted to open-ended via illegal amendments |
| **Signature** | Real ossir-logged obligation | Paperwork mismatch; altered after transfer |

**Why it matters for the story:**
- The debt and its transfer were legitimate; the ongoing bondage is not
- Proving predatory alteration voids Ornan’s contract rights
- Ornan is destroying payroll, valuation, and amendment records
- The siblings must recover originals that show the pre-transfer terms

**The smoking gun (discovered Book 1):**
Facility and contract logs show the “chronomass accident” that triggered Sava’s forced term never occurred as stated (or was double-counted), and amendments expanding scope/maturity were backdated after transfer to Ornan.

## Series Arc (Five Books)

### Book 1: [Title TBD]
A job goes wrong. The siblings are exposed to someone who knew their father. First evidence the stake documents are forged. They learn Dren was investigating something.

**Stakes:** Survival + first real hope that they can prove the Claim is false

### Book 2: [Title TBD]
Following Dren's trail leads toward Krovam (Belt rival territory). They discover he found evidence of a scheme bigger than one House. The scheme involves experimental chronomass work.

**Stakes:** The truth is bigger than they thought + new enemies

### Book 3: [Title TBD]
Sava's condition is deteriorating faster. The siblings face a choice: continue investigating or take a dangerous job that could buy out her contract. The job is connected to what Dren found.

**Stakes:** Mother's life vs. the investigation + impossible choice

### Book 4: [Title TBD]
The truth about Dren's death. He didn’t just find evidence—he was going to expose Ornan’s predatory debt interception program. He was killed, and the altered contract trail was the cover-up. The siblings have enough to bring it down.

**Stakes:** They can destroy House Ornan but it will destroy them too

### Book 5: [Title TBD]
The confrontation. What are Tarek and Venn willing to actually stake—not Fortune, but really stake—to free their mother and finish what their father started?

**Stakes:** Everything

## World Position

**Location:** Knalvossak and surrounding metro ring  
**Social Position:** Margins. Grey economy. Skilled but unlicensed.  
**Legal Status:** Precarious. Orphans without charter-hold. Unlicensed rigs.  
**Economic Status:** Hand-to-mouth. What they earn running cargo.

**Contacts (to be developed):**
- Grey market job-givers
- Fence/information contacts
- People who knew their father
- Potential allies and betrayers

---

## Antagonist: House Ornan

**Position:** Belt House. Kronvar territory. Experimental starter work.  
**Public face:** Innovative, ambitious, pushing chronomass yields  
**Reality:** Willing to kill to protect secrets. Manufactured the Kelsar Claim.  

**What they're hiding:**
- Experimental chronomass work killing workers
- Forged Claims to acquire skilled labor (Sava is not the only one)
- Yield failures blamed on "starter problems" are actually poisoning
- Dren's audit documented all of it before they killed him

## House Ornan's Tactical Playbook (Claim-Counter Operations)

Ornan doesn't just have money and muscle. **They understand Fortune mechanics** and use them to hunt people who rely on luck.

### Five Counter-Tactics (Used Against the Kelsars)

| Tactic | How It Works | Story Application |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Force controlled spaces** | Claims seat harder in low-uncertainty environments; dirty claims are easier to track | They herd the siblings into predictable locations |
| **Reduce uncertainty with discipline** | Professional crews don't leave gaps for Fortune to exploit | Their hunters don't make "lucky" mistakes |
| **Add noise and decoys** | Multiple pursuit vectors make claim anchoring unreliable | Siblings can't just "claim" the right escape route |
| **Track residue** | House ossirs and tuned instruments follow claim signatures | Every big bend the siblings make marks them |
| **Create moral hazard** | Bait repeated claims, let collection hit when target is weak | They want the siblings desperate and Fortune-depleted |

**Key figures:**
- **Ornan Enforcement Lead:** TBD — The hunter who understands Fortune warfare
- **Ornan Inside Contact:** TBD — The scared one who helped Dren, now helping the kids
- **Ornan House Head:** TBD — The authority who ordered Dren's death
