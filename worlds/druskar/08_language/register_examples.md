## Code-Switching in Dialogue

Characters naturally shift registers based on context:

**Formal meeting:**
"House Verran acknowledges receipt of the Bloom Advisory BA·26·2·14 and will adjust admissibility posture accordingly."

**Same person, later, to colleague:**
"Verran's going to tighten up on the bloom stuff. Advisory came through this morning."

**Same person, at tavern:**
"Verran's getting jumpy about blooms again. Watch your cargo."

| Too casual for context | Disrespectful, over-familiar, rebel |
| Mixing registers | Stress, deception, unfamiliar with local customs |
| Wrong suffix usage | Not from here, educated differently |
| Legacy forms (Jitknalos) | Old-fashioned, rural Belt origin, legal training |
