# DRUSKAR — World Overview

**Primary Nation:** Puljitos
**Primary City Arena:** Knalvossak (Trade: Knalvoss; Street: Voss)

## The Elevator Pitch

Druskar is an **arcane-punk canal-state** where water is law, paperwork is power, and the supernatural has been industrialized into infrastructure. Set on a cold shelf where roads rot, the canals are the only reliable arteries of commerce, migration, and control.

The state of **Puljitos** survives by turning chokepoints into legitimacy: locks + seals + assay truth. Three supernatural systems have been domesticated into economic and bureaucratic machinery:
- **Oddswork** (luck as settlement/debt)
- **Chronomass** (time manipulation via biological fuel)
- **Density craft** (mass/volume redistribution)

Every use leaves evidence. Bureaucracy is physical. Forensics beat names.

## Design Pillars

1. **Conservation-first** — No free matter; work is paid
2. **Nonlinear scaling** — Big effects cost disproportionately more
3. **Forensics-first** — Every use leaves evidence
4. **Bureaucracy is physical** — Chokepoints make paperwork real
5. **Arcane-punk is infrastructure** — Meters, seals, assays, filters, clocks, routing
6. **Firearms baseline** — Revolvers and carbines are normal

## The Three Systems (Quick Reference)

### ODDSWORK (Luck)
- **Fortune:** spendable balance to tilt outcomes
- **Heat:** attention/externality load
- **Claims:** deferred settlement that comes due later

### CHRONOMASS (Time)
- **Seatcraft:** innate time-slow envelopes
- **Rigcraft:** harness-driven limited envelopes
- **Clockwork:** devices that measure/resist/anchor/screen

### DENSITY
- **Innate:** rare Cap/Flow/Strain
- **Rigcraft:** self-only redistribution
- **Transfer Mates:** paired clamps for non-living objects

---

## Power Structure

### External Pressure
- **Veskari:** tariff + blockade doctrine (Brinav Narrows)
- **Selren:** quarantine + blacklist doctrine (Whitecord Gate)

### Internal Rivals
- **Krovam:** wants grading legitimacy
- **Raskesh:** wants export autonomy
- **Sarnketh:** quarantine throat creates policy weapons

### Knalvossak Triangle
- **Canal Commission:** schedules, closures, gate priority
- **Seal Houses:** identity, validity, cargo truth
- **Order Companies:** contract coercion, seizure, escort

---

## Tone and Genre

**Genre:** Arcane-punk industrial noir
**Tone:** Gritty, procedural, forensic
**Violence:** Present but consequential
**Magic:** Industrialized, regulated, leaves evidence
**Conflict:** Economic, bureaucratic, legal warfare as common as physical

## Key Themes

### Thematic Pillars (see [01_story_spine/thematic_core.md](01_story_spine/thematic_core.md))

**Law vs Oath vs Hospitality:** *Every favor is a debt, every promise is a contract, and there's no such thing as free shelter.*
- Law (Commission protocols) vs Oath (Order contracts, Claims) vs Hospitality (absent—the wound)
- Human connection has been monetized; shelter costs; help creates debt

**Artifice vs Soul:** *The paperwork is real. The devices are real. But you're still bleeding through.*
- Artifice (devices, documents, seals) protects through erasure
- Soul (innate ability, authentic self) is a liability that leaves evidence
- The system tries to reduce you to ledger entries; the soul refuses

### Supporting Themes
- Legitimacy vs. legality
- The cost of power (literal and social)
- Bureaucracy as both oppression and protection
- Infrastructure as battlefield
- Evidence over accusations
- The price of shortcuts
