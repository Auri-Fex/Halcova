**Version:** v1.2 (Comprehensive + Zoomed-Out Strategic Board + Arcane-Punk Device Ecology + Biota Policy)

> **Navigation:** This is the canonical reference document. For quick reference, see [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md). For story development, see [storyengine_maimingwars/](storyengine_maimingwars/).

**Hard locks**

* **World:** Druskar
* **Continent (mapped):** Salkorin
* **Sea / gulf:** Brinav (Brinav Gulf)
* **Country-state:** Puljitos
* **Primary city arena:** Knalvossak (Trade: Knalvoss; Street: Voss)
* **Region/tract legacy:** Jitknalos is legacy written; **spoken/trade: Jitknal**
* **Tracts:** **no tract suffixes** (no “-os”); classification via **descriptor words** + **dot tract codes**
* **Conlang:** **no hyphens**
* **Marks:** dot-only (middle dot) formatting everywhere

---

## A) Design pillars

1. Conservation-first (no free matter; work is paid).
2. Nonlinear scaling (big effects cost disproportionately more).
3. Forensics-first (every use leaves evidence).
4. Bureaucracy is physical (chokepoints make paperwork real).
5. Arcane-punk is infrastructure (meters, seals, assays, filters, clocks, routing). Combat gear is a subset.
6. Firearms baseline (revolvers and carbines are normal).

---

## A2) Thematic pillars

**Full reference:** [01_story_spine/thematic_core.md](01_story_spine/thematic_core.md)

### Law vs Oath vs Hospitality
*Every favor is a debt, every promise is a contract, and there’s no such thing as free shelter.*

| Force | System Expression |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Law** | Commission protocols, closure orders, admissibility requirements |
| **Oath** | Order contracts, Fortune Claims, bonded obligations |
| **Hospitality** | *Absent*—the wound. Human connection has been monetized. |

### Artifice vs Soul
*The paperwork is real. The devices are real. But you’re still bleeding through.*

| Force | System Expression |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Artifice** | Devices, documents, seals—survival through becoming a ledger entry |
| **Soul** | Innate ability, authentic self—liability that leaves Heat and evidence |

**Central Question:** *What does it cost to stay human in a world that prices everything?*

---

## B) Macro geography and political board

### B1) The macro labels

* **Salkorin:** the mapped continent where the canal-states matter.
* **Brinav Gulf:** brackwater sea system; blooms, tariffs, and “customs” legitimacy.

### B2) Puljitos placement

Puljitos sits on a cold shelf where roads rot and canals are the only reliable arteries. The state’s power is the ability to turn  **water movement into lawful movement** .

---

## C) Administrative naming and codes

### C1) Tracts and regions (new canon)

* **Tracts are bare names** in speech and on most maps.
* Classification uses  **descriptor words** : Belt, March, Step, Flats, Labyrinth.
* Bureaucracy uses  **dot tract codes** :

**Puljitos stamped tract format (default):** `T#·Name`
(Optionally, external-facing paperwork may prepend a polity tag, but it is not required in internal Puljitos docs.)

Examples:

* **T1·Jitknal** (Jitknal Labyrinth)
* **T2·Kronvar** (Kronvar Belt)

### C2) Settlement suffixes (still used for towns/cities, not tracts)

Suffixes label  *function* , not “regional flavor.” Do not suffix-spam locally.

* **ak** chartered commission seat (rare)
* **am** market town / exchange hub
* **vek** works/yard settlement
* **esh** quay/port enclave
* **ur** fort/keep
* **keth** checkpoint hamlet
* **il** lock-village
* **ot** outstation/camp
* **ar** borough/jurisdiction label (limited; mostly administrative)
* **en** ward/quarter label (limited; mostly internal/census)
* **bare names** are common (historic cores, infamous cuts, lived quarters)

---

## D) Puljitos tract board (locked)

1. **Jitknal Labyrinth** — **T1·Jitknal** (legacy written: Jitknalos)
2. **Kronvar Belt** — **T2·Kronvar**
3. **Brinav March** — **T3·Brinav**
4. **Kestnar Step** — **T4·Kestnar**
5. **Varnek Flats** — **T5·Varnek**

---

## E) Primary city arena — Knalvossak

### E1) Why it exists

Knalvossak sits on the last reliable hardground lip where the state can meter flow before Jitknal turns navigation into probability.

### E2) City anatomy (three-layer model)

1. **Lock Ladder:** gates, teeth, braces, spillways, governors.
2. **Registry Spine:** Commission offices + Seal benches adjacent to gates.
3. **Tow/Market Belt:** labor, hunger, repairs, and the street economy wrapped around throughput.

### E3) Power triangle (Knalvossak)

* **Canal Commission:** schedules, closures, gate priority, emergency protocol.
* **Seal Houses:** identity, validity, cargo truth, admissibility.
* **Order Companies:** contract coercion; seizure and escort as paid services.

### E4) Proof standard (how people get caught)

Gate logs, schedule boards, assays, custody seals, device residues, Heat clustering, Claim timing.

---

## F) Knalvossak metro ring (mixed suffix rule enforced)

**Approach chain**

* **Vosseketh** (keth) checkpoint hamlet
* **Knalvam** (am) tow market
* **Luskil** (il) lock village
* **Gatur** (ur) fortified watch

**Seaward works**

* **Caskesh** (esh) bonded quays
* **Hullvek** (vek) hull yard and braces
* **Brinefield** (bare) low flats industry

**Inland edge**

* **Jitesh** (esh) drift landing
* **Jitot** (ot) outstation
* **Lanterncut** (bare) posted narrow cut

**Specialized craft**

* **Pinsvek** (vek) Transfer Mate craft row

**Bare-name cores**

* **Pechaten** (bare) old clerk row neighborhood
* **Belkran** (bare) oldest charter stone core

---

## G) The three systems (Luck / Time / Density)

# G1) ODDSWORK — Luck as settlement (universal access)

### Ledgers

* **Fortune:** spendable balance used to tilt outcomes.
* **Heat:** attention/externality load created by bends.
* **Claims:** deferred settlement that comes due later (often clustered and context-cruel).

### Earning Fortune (Control Test)

Fortune can only be earned by wagering on outcomes you  **cannot control** . Fraud-tainted wagering produces Heat/Claim risk instead of clean Fortune.

### Spending Fortune

Small bends are survivable; medium bends become lifestyle; large bends create correlated Claims and enforcement interest.

### Forensics

Heat clustering, streak signatures around queues/schedules/auctions, Claim timing correlations.

---

# G2) TIME — Chronomass timecraft (No-Field compliant)

### Categories

* **Seatcraft (innate):** living user generates local time-slow envelopes.
* **Rigcraft (hybrid):** non-Seat user drives limited envelope behavior using a living-driver harness.
* **Clockwork (devices):** measure/resist/anchor/screen/contain; do not distort time.

### Core effects

* **Blink:** burst envelope enabling “impossible speed” along a real path. Not teleport.
* **Study (Dwell):** skin-close dilation for learning/practice.

### Scaling (nonlinear)

Envelope size × duration × intensity; costs explode and residue strengthens.

### Reserve states

* **Seat:** Full → ¾ → ½ → ¼ → Low → Empty
* **Rig:** Fed → Sated → Thin → Dry → Starved → Venting
* **Device:** Charged → Spent → Overheated → Breached

### Locked countermeasure: Sync Mantle

Wearable chronomass metering harness that keeps a non-caster **comparatively active** inside an enemy envelope.
Costs: constant burn, tremor/nausea, screenable; not absolute.

---

# G3) DENSITY — Innate / Rigcraft / Transfer Mates

### Innate density (rare)

Cap/Flow/Strain model; biomechanics is real; pushing the dial injures you.

### Density Rigcraft (self-only redistribution)

No net mass or volume change; redistributes mass through the body under Δ caps and gradient rules. Best use pattern is short pulses (contact windows). Failures: torque tears, shear, oscillation.

### Transfer Mate devices (paired clamps; non-living only)

Two matched mates couple two  **non-living objects** .
Costs: chronomass burn + heat vent + residue; failures are violent and forensic.

**Modes**

* **Mode M (Mass Transfer):** swap mass; volumes fixed.
* **Mode B (Bulk Transfer):** transfer mass+volume; receiver grows under jig/template constraint.
* **Mode V (Volume Transfer):** exchange packing/void; mass fixed; expanded becomes weaker, compacted becomes brittle.

**Anti-size-superhero locks**

* Mates do not latch to living targets.
* Mode V is packing/porosity, not “free strength.”
* Rigcraft never changes volume.

---

## H) Arcane-punk device ecosystem (the world is more than combat)

**Rule:** most devices exist to control **flow** (water, people, fuel, truth, liability). Combat use is an industrial tool pushed into illegal contexts.

### H1) Civic infrastructure (Commission / Gateworks)

* Gateclock boards (schedule teeth + ticks)
* Spill governors (pressure regulation; intentional floods are policy tools)
* Towpath tick beacons (cadence references in fog)

### H2) Seal and custody (Seal Houses)

* Custody seals and sealboxes (tamper evidence as engineered resin behavior)
* Mark readers (verify dot-strings, admissibility, routing)

### H3) Chronomass handling (Assay economy)

* Assay lanterns (residue/grade reads)
* Setters (Raw→Set conversion under metered control)
* Purge kits (controlled venting; always logged)

### H4) Time countermeasure stack (No-Field compliant)

* Sync mantles (active-in-envelope)
* Trip lattices (announce envelope events)
* Cadence pins (keep squads synced so Blink can’t peel them cleanly)

### H5) Density engineering stack

* Bulk jigs (Mode B geometry constraint)
* Load balancers (Mode M stabilization for cranes/gates)
* Volume spreaders (Mode V emergency bridging/barriers with known weakness)

### H6) Enforcement/inspection tools

* Seam chalk, residue cuffs, portable assay plates
* Evidence handling is procedural; “proof over names” is how contracts pay out.

### H7) Comms and navigation (non-radio)

* Signal boards (posted slips tied to ticks)
* Route compasses (point to next permitted authority lane, not north)

### H8) Labor/medicine/survival

* Tremor dampers, heat sinks, respirators, decon lanes
* Domestic devices: wick heaters, ledger lamps (time-stamped proof for wages/curfews)

---

## I) Chronomass economy (where fuel comes from, and how it becomes legal)

### I1) Three source channels

1. **Kronvar Belt** (legal mainline): charter farms produce most **Set** lots.
2. **Jitknal Labyrinth** (grey): wild traps produce **Raw/Cut** lots; high residue risk.
3. **Brinav March** (seasonal): brackwater blooms create shock supply and counterfeit incentives.

### I2) Custody path into legality (default)

**Bonded quay intake → assay/grading → registry release**
Skipping assay is the fastest route to seizure, quarantine, or a “maintenance closure” that ruins you.

### I3) Commercial truth states

* **Raw:** unstable, quarantine-handled.
* **Set:** stable, main legal trade form.
* **Cut:** adulterated street form; cheaper, dirtier, more forensic.

---

## J) Biota policy (Option A locked)

### J1) Core rule

 **Druskar is mostly Earthlike** , with a **small endemic layer** concentrated where canals, quarantine, chronomass handling, and industrial cultures overlap.

### J2) Puljitos Field List (15 entries; stamped · street · habitat · use · hazard · forensic tell)

(kept exactly as established)

1. Kronofag · Chron · Belt farms/Jitknal traps · chronomass source · residue outbreaks · banded wick-darkening
2. Setstarter · Starter · Aselvek benches · stabilizes Raw→Set · delayed lot failure · late vent-bloom scars
3. Blekkult · Bleach · Brinefield/Aselvek lanes · decon/antiseptic · lung-burn vapor · pale brass film + throat rash
4. Filtmat · Mat · respirators/vents · living filters · spore false positives · lantern flags but grades don’t match
5. Resinvet · Resin · Seal Houses · tamper seals · pests/counterfeit resin · fracture geometry mismatch
6. Bindermit · Mites · bonded yards · pest · manufactured “tamper” · uniform nibble-line on seal edge
7. Totheel · Teeth · gate housings · pest · jams teeth/bites divers · grease smear + brass scoring
8. Chainsnail · Chalk · chains/governors · biofoul · drag/governor slip · chalk spiral on links
9. Siltwasp · Pin · braces/spill courts · pest · brace weakening/tremor stings · pinhole nest lines + sting clusters
10. Bloomgnat · Gnat · March blooms · rare additive · assay contamination · sticky lantern sheen, wet-iron smell
11. Rotkelp · Rot · brackwater flats · membranes/packing · confusion off-gas · black-green nail film + cloth odor
12. Shellstock · Shell · trough farms · protein · spoil storms · gut-sick clusters tied to trough stamp
13. Gelstock · Gel · vat houses · protein/glue · fast spread contamination · clear-brown stringing on tools
14. Towbeast · Tow · Knalvam/Luskil · hauling · panic in envelope events · hoof-splay prints across cuts
15. Wickmold · Wick · domestic heaters · heat stability · soot-sweet fumes · soot signature + sweet hair/cloth smell

### J3) Legal consequence

Quarantine is not cosmetic. It exists because endemic biota can ruin grade, compromise seals, destabilize lockworks, and create plausible deniability for seizures.

---

## K) Neighbor polities (external pressure that keeps Puljitos mean)

# K1) Veskari — tariff + blockade doctrine

**Doctrine:** “Tolls are sovereignty.” Paper-backed cutters and lawful-looking privateers.

**Regions (trade map style; stamped identifiers used on filings)**

* **Veskesh Reach** (capital port)
* **Tarvek Yardchain** (yards, chain stock, hull frames)
* **Sornam Coastmarket** (auctions, charter brokers, blockade drafting)
* **Reedward Shoals** (marsh-islands, smuggling and inspectors)

**Sea lane choke (locked)**

* **Skelur** (fort-watch) controlling the **Brinav Narrows**
  Buoy chain + tick beacons define the legal channel; bond cutters enforce; assay lanterns justify seizures as “customs.”

# K2) Selren — quarantine + blacklist doctrine

**Doctrine:** “Clean passage outranks commerce.” They deny admissibility before they seize goods.

**Regions**

* **Selrendur Keepseat** (capital fortress administration)
* **Whitecord Cordon** (border belt of lanes, pens, burn pits)
* **Harmek Step** (upland logistics spine)
* **Clinvek Works** (decon kit, filters, meters—evidence supply)

**Border choke (locked)**

* **Vordketh** (checkpoint complex) — trade name **Whitecord Gate**
  Three lanes: Clear / Wash / Hold. Selren throttles Puljitos by admissibility. Puljitos answers by routing around (smuggling pressure into Jitknal).

---

## L) Internal Puljitos rivals (the state fights itself)

### L1) Rival market city (locked)

* **Krovam** (am) — *Kronvar Beltmarket*
  Not a commission-seat; it wants “truth power” (grading legitimacy) so Knalvossak stops skimming margin by monopoly.

### L2) Belt quarantine throat (locked)

* **Sarnketh** (keth) — quarantine checkpoint where lots become **touch-legal**
  Touch-legal = permissible to handle under quarantine protocol; not “good,” just “not automatically seized for contact.”

### L3) Rival port enclave (locked)

* **Raskesh** (esh) — *Marchwater Port Enclave*
  Wants to bond/export without routing everything through Knalvossak. Knalvossak treats it as a leak; Raskesh treats Knalvossak as a choke.

### L4) Belt Houses (minimum set; locked)

* **House Velt:** high-volume, conservative protocols, low variance, hard to counterfeit.
* **House Ornan:** experimental starters, aggressive yields, higher late-failure risk.
* **House Kivren:** transport/custody specialists; profit from routing and schedule control.

---

## M) Order Companies (private law that functions because it’s priced)

**Order doctrine:** enforcement is risk pricing. Contracts are won by reducing loss rates; “proof” matters because liability and insurance are the real courts.

### M1) The Big Three (locked)

1. **Gaturline Order** — Knalvossak / gate corridor
   Specialty: checkpoint enforcement, mantle escorts, seizure logistics.
   Signature: procedural receipts (detain slips, custody seals, timed logs).
2. **Krovam Shield Service** — Belt / Krovam / convoys
   Specialty: quarantine control, convoy protection, outbreak suppression.
   Signature: bleach film on brass; “health” used as coercion.
3. **Reedward Contract Patrol** — March / Raskesh / flats
   Specialty: smuggler interdiction, bloom-season surges, night landings.
   Signature: brackwater sheen + bloom film on lantern glass.

### M2) Structural conflict

* Gaturline wants everything routed through Knalvossak lanes.
* Krovam Shield wants Belt autonomy and lower Knalvossak interference.
* Reedward Patrol profits when the March stays “dangerous.”

---

## N) Conlang — Druskar v0.3 (de-clunk spec)

* **No hyphens.**
* Compounds concatenate; insert a single **e** only to avoid ugly clusters.
* Stress: simplex first-syllable; compounds stress the head stem (rightmost meaningful stem before a suffix).
* Registers:
  * **Stamped:** conservative spellings, full forms
  * **Trade:** shorter, readable
  * **Street:** clipped, suffix-dropping when context allows
    Example behavior: Knalvossak → Knalvoss → Voss.

---

## O) Names and marks (people, devices, custody)

### O1) Person naming registers

* **Stamped:** Given + Line + Mark
* **Trade:** Given + Line
* **Street:** clipped Given/Line or nickname
  Line is one affiliation type (place/house/works/guild/lineage), not stacked.

### O2) Device/custody marks (dot-only)

Devices and lots carry dot strings tying certification + permit class + authority routing. Counterfeiters usually misroute marks (plate swaps, partial restamps, forged permit class), creating mismatch tells.

---

## P) Unit types (action + infrastructure roles)

* Luck: Pool Captain, Claim Surgeon, Queue Broker
* Time: Blink Courier, Rig Runner, Mantled Marshal
* Density: Rigweight Bruiser, Mate Saboteur, Clampwright/Jigwright
* Infrastructure: Assay Burner, Meterwright, Seal Clerk, Governor Fitter
* Enforcement: Contract Marshal, Quarantine Warden, Bond Cutter Officer

---

## Q) Forensics reference (what investigators actually use)

* ODDSWORK: Heat clustering, streak signatures, Claim timing
* Time: assay residue, vent bloom scars, mantle wear patterns, gate-log impossibilities
* Density devices: clamp scorch, seam dust, oscillation scars, donor/receiver geometry tells
* Rigcraft: joint/tendon trauma signatures, vent handling mistakes, plate mismatches
* Biota: bloom film, resin fracture geometry, chain chalk layers, “dirty clean” assay contradictions

---

## R) Strategic board (what’s true at world scale)

* Puljitos survives by turning chokepoints into legitimacy (locks + seals + assay truth).
* Veskari squeezes with tariffs and lawful blockades at the Brinav Narrows.
* Selren squeezes with quarantine doctrine and blacklists at Whitecord Gate.
* Internally, Krovam and Raskesh pressure Knalvossak’s monopoly on turning fuel into legality.
* The Belt throat (Sarnketh) creates late-failure scandals that become policy weapons.

---

## S) Immediate expansion hooks (ready-to-build arenas)

1. **Kronvar Belt:** named quarantine town network, starter wars, labor regimes
2. **Brinav March:** bloom calendar, port politics, night-reed smuggling geometry
3. **Whitecord Gate region:** blacklist economics, admissibility theater, “wash lane” corruption
4. **Brinav Narrows:** Veskari customs doctrine, privateer charters, tariff warfare


Reviewing: world_bible.docx

Below are the **three world-bible additions** you’ve teed up (all of them):

1. **Brinav March Bloom Calendar** (with forecasting + economic consequences)
2. **Canal Commission Closure Protocol** (formal weaponizable procedure)
3. **Seal House Landscape** (who makes “truth” and how their seals tell on them)

---

# APPENDIX A — Brinav March Bloom Calendar v1.0

## A1) Calendar format (Puljitos standard)

Puljitos schedules by **Ledger Months (LM1–LM12)** and **Weeks (W1–W4)** because the state’s religion is throughput. This is an administrative convention; locals still speak in weather and work.

**Bloom risk season:** typically  **LM4–LM7** . The exact start shifts year to year and is forecasted, not guessed.

## A2) Forecasting instruments (what the March actually watches)

Puljitos does not “predict blooms.” It **issues advisories** based on gauges.

### The Brin Gauge (standard March station)

* **Device:** harbor-made gauge with a grown kelp-skin under glass; the skin puffs; a toothed ring slips a notch; a pointer holds after a tap.
* **Plain read:** “Brinav up 2 ticks” (salinity and bloom-support chemistry rising).
* **Next action:** Commission issues a Bloom Advisory tier; assay benches switch to bloom protocol.

### The Silt Glass (lockworks station)

* **Device:** settling vial with a marked spine; silt line climbs; the mark is read against a stamped band.
* **Plain read:** “Silt band entered.”
* **Next action:** spill governors are adjusted; chain crews schedule scrape and flush.

### The Lantern Wick Test (field quick check)

* **Device:** assay lantern; wick film darkens or stays clear after a pass over surface water.
* **Plain read:** “Residue present” or “clean.”
* **Next action:** route cargo to Wash Lane or clear.

## A3) Bloom tiers (what the Commission posts)

Bloom tiers are posted as slips and used for pricing, insurance, and enforcement.

* **Tier 0 — Clear Season** (LM1–LM3 usually)
  Normal assay thresholds. Normal patrol contracts.
* **Tier 1 — Drift Season** (typical LM4 W1–W2)
  Early bloom gnats appear intermittently. Lantern false positives rise.
  **Rule change:** more lots are routed to Wash Lane by default.
* **Tier 2 — Bloom Season** (typical LM4 W3 through LM6)
  Bloom gnats common; rot kelp handling spikes; brackwater sheen is frequent.
  **Rule change:** bonded quays tighten admissibility; Seal benches require additional proof steps.
* **Tier 3 — Surge Weeks** (2–4 weeks inside LM5–LM6, varies)
  Highest contamination risk and highest counterfeiting pressure.
  **Rule change:** closures become routine; Order companies get surge retainers; convoy schedules become political weapons.
* **Tier 4 — Black Weeks** (rare, usually 1–2 weeks when Brin Gauge jumps hard)
  System is in “containment posture.”
  **Rule change:** Hold Lane expands, burn pits run, and Selren admissibility becomes hostile by default.

## A4) What blooms do to the economy (immediate consequences)

* **Chronomass price:** Set lots rise in price; Cut lots flood the street; Raw becomes dangerous to even possess.
* **Insurance posture:** premiums spike; exclusions multiply; disputes surge (“late vent bloom” becomes a courtroom genre).
* **Order contracts:** Reedward Patrol makes its year in the March; Gaturline uses “safety posture” to justify seizures.
* **Smuggling pattern:** shifts from hiding cargo to hiding **biological signatures** (rot odor, bloom film, resin fracture mismatch).

## A5) Biological schedule overlay (Puljitos Field List timing)

These aren’t “seasons” in a pastoral sense. They’re maintenance nightmares with price tags.

* **Chainsnail layers** build fastest in **Tier 1–2** (governor slip risk rises).
* **Tooth-eel nesting** peaks in **Tier 2** (gate jamming incidents spike).
* **Bloom gnats** peak in **Tier 2–3** (false quarantines become plausible).
* **Rot kelp handling** spikes in **Tier 2–4** (confusion incidents rise; cheap membrane trade explodes).

---

# APPENDIX B — Canal Commission Closure Protocol v1.0

Puljitos doesn’t “close canals.” It issues **closure orders** with receipts, chain states, and liability assignments.

## B1) Closure classes (what kind of shutdown it is)

Each closure order must be one of these classes:

1. **WC — Works Closure** (maintenance/repair)
2. **QC — Quarantine Closure** (biota/residue/assay risk)
3. **SC — Safety Closure** (structural failure risk, governor instability)
4. **EC — Enforcement Closure** (active seizure operation, escort routing)

**Rule:** a closure order is invalid without a class. Misclassing is the standard way corruption wears a tie.

## B2) Required roles (signatures that make it real)

A valid closure order requires  **three sign-offs** :

* **Commission Clerk** (issues the order, posts slips)
* **Gatewright Foreman** (confirms physical lock state and brace condition)
* **Seal Bench Officer** (confirms custody impact and admissibility notes)

Optional but common add-ons:

* **Assay Burner** (QC justification)
* **Order Captain** (EC execution plan)

## B3) The closure sequence (step-by-step, procedural)

1. **Trigger Receipt Created**
   * A gauge reading, incident report, or enforcement writ is logged to a docket number.
2. **Pre-Closure Read**
   * Assay lantern and/or Brin Gauge read is taken and logged (even for WC, because QC is the easiest excuse on earth).
3. **Order Issued**
   * Closure slip created with: class, affected cuts, start tick, expected reopen tick, and responsible Order company (if any).
4. **Posting and Clocking**
   * Slip posted to the board rail (new posts only; old to Else rail).
   * Gateclock board advances to a marked closure notch for the relevant window.
5. **Physical Lock State Set**
   * Teeth engaged, braces seated, spill governors set to closure posture.
   * If the cut is navigable, **tick beacons** are set to “no-cadence” so convoys can’t plausibly claim confusion.
6. **Seal Actions**
   * Cargo already in-lane is either: sealed in place, routed to Wash Lane, or rebooked.
   * Custody seals applied to any bonded lots halted mid-route.
7. **Verification Pass**
   * A second read is taken and logged after lock state is set (this is how they prove the closure “worked”).

## B4) Reopen protocol (how it ends)

Reopen requires:

* a logged **post-closure read** (assay, silt, governor stability),
* a **brace receipt** (what was done, what was replaced),
* and a new posted slip with the reopen tick.

If QC was the class, reopen typically adds: purge kit use logged, wash lanes expanded, and admissibility notes updated.

## B5) Abuse points (how villains stay “legal”)

* **Rolling closures:** close adjacent cuts in sequence to trap a competitor convoy without “targeting” them on paper.
* **QC laundering:** use minor bloom film as a QC justification to seize unrelated cargo as “unsafe.”
* **Works pretext:** schedule “maintenance” exactly when Belt convoys arrive, then blame scarcity on biology.
* **Selective admissibility:** reopen, but only accept seals from certain benches “pending review.”

Puljitos doesn’t need moustache-twirling. It has forms.

---

# APPENDIX C — Seal House Landscape v1.0

Seal Houses are not mystical. They are  **validity factories** . They decide what counts as “tampered,” “admissible,” and “processable.”

## C1) The three major Knalvossak Seal Houses

Each House has a distinct **fracture geometry** in its resin culture. That becomes both branding and forensics.

### 1) **House Verran** (high-volume cargo truth)

* **Domain:** bonded lots, convoy seals, quay custody
* **Political posture:** Commission-aligned; prefers stability and throughput
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **ladder lines** (parallel craze bands)
* **Forensic tell:** ladder spacing is consistent; counterfeit resin shows uneven banding under lantern raking.

### 2) **House Kelm** (people and passage truth)

* **Domain:** identity admissibility, passage papers, blacklist notes
* **Political posture:** quiet power; closest to Selren’s “clean passage” doctrine
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **comb teeth** (one spine with regular tooth cracks)
* **Forensic tell:** comb spines “step” at a predictable angle; plate-swapped stamps leave angle mismatch.

### 3) **House Orvek** (device and tool truth)

* **Domain:** tool admissibility, mate set certification, mantle service records
* **Political posture:** industry-first; tied to Pinsvek and Gatvek makers
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **star bursts** (radial spokes from a single point)
* **Forensic tell:** true Orvek stars have a tight center bloom; adulterated paste blooms too wide and chalks at the edges.

## C2) Outbench reality (Krovam and Raskesh)

* **Krovam Bench:** weaker authority, constantly challenged by Knalvossak benches; often forced to over-document to be believed.
* **Raskesh Bench:** aggressive triage posture; tries to make export bonding “good enough,” which Knalvossak uses as a reason to distrust it.

## C3) How Seal Houses fight (non-violent, devastating)

* tighten admissibility requirements (more proof steps)
* issue “review holds” that function as embargoes
* selectively accept or reject outbench stamps
* sponsor Order contracts indirectly by declaring things “unsafe”

---

If you want the next “lock it into play” step, the highest leverage is a **single page of standard slip templates** (Bloom Advisory, Closure Order, Reopen Notice, Admissibility Review, Detain Receipt). That gives you diegetic paper you can drop into scenes like ammunition.

* **Next action:** spill governors are adjusted; chain crews schedule scrape and flush.

### The Lantern Wick Test (field quick check)

* **Device:** assay lantern; wick film darkens or stays clear after a pass over surface water.
* **Plain read:** “Residue present” or “clean.”
* **Next action:** route cargo to Wash Lane or clear.

## A3) Bloom tiers (what the Commission posts)

Bloom tiers are posted as slips and used for pricing, insurance, and enforcement.

* **Tier 0 — Clear Season** (LM1–LM3 usually)
  Normal assay thresholds. Normal patrol contracts.
* **Tier 1 — Drift Season** (typical LM4 W1–W2)
  Early bloom gnats appear intermittently. Lantern false positives rise.
  **Rule change:** more lots are routed to Wash Lane by default.
* **Tier 2 — Bloom Season** (typical LM4 W3 through LM6)
  Bloom gnats common; rot kelp handling spikes; brackwater sheen is frequent.
  **Rule change:** bonded quays tighten admissibility; Seal benches require additional proof steps.
* **Tier 3 — Surge Weeks** (2–4 weeks inside LM5–LM6, varies)
  Highest contamination risk and highest counterfeiting pressure.
  **Rule change:** closures become routine; Order companies get surge retainers; convoy schedules become political weapons.
* **Tier 4 — Black Weeks** (rare, usually 1–2 weeks when Brin Gauge jumps hard)
  System is in “containment posture.”
  **Rule change:** Hold Lane expands, burn pits run, and Selren admissibility becomes hostile by default.

## A4) What blooms do to the economy (immediate consequences)

* **Chronomass price:** Set lots rise in price; Cut lots flood the street; Raw becomes dangerous to even possess.
* **Insurance posture:** premiums spike; exclusions multiply; disputes surge (“late vent bloom” becomes a courtroom genre).
* **Order contracts:** Reedward Patrol makes its year in the March; Gaturline uses “safety posture” to justify seizures.
* **Smuggling pattern:** shifts from hiding cargo to hiding **biological signatures** (rot odor, bloom film, resin fracture mismatch).

## A5) Biological schedule overlay (Puljitos Field List timing)

These aren’t “seasons” in a pastoral sense. They’re maintenance nightmares with price tags.

* **Chainsnail layers** build fastest in **Tier 1–2** (governor slip risk rises).
* **Tooth-eel nesting** peaks in **Tier 2** (gate jamming incidents spike).
* **Bloom gnats** peak in **Tier 2–3** (false quarantines become plausible).
* **Rot kelp handling** spikes in **Tier 2–4** (confusion incidents rise; cheap membrane trade explodes).

# APPENDIX B — Canal Commission Closure Protocol v1.0

Puljitos doesn’t “close canals.” It issues **closure orders** with receipts, chain states, and liability assignments.

## B1) Closure classes (what kind of shutdown it is)

Each closure order must be one of these classes:

1. **WC — Works Closure** (maintenance/repair)
2. **QC — Quarantine Closure** (biota/residue/assay risk)
3. **SC — Safety Closure** (structural failure risk, governor instability)
4. **EC — Enforcement Closure** (active seizure operation, escort routing)

**Rule:** a closure order is invalid without a class. Misclassing is the standard way corruption wears a tie.

## B2) Required roles (signatures that make it real)

A valid closure order requires  **three sign-offs** :

* **Commission Clerk** (issues the order, posts slips)
* **Gatewright Foreman** (confirms physical lock state and brace condition)
* **Seal Bench Officer** (confirms custody impact and admissibility notes)

Optional but common add-ons:

* **Assay Burner** (QC justification)
* **Order Captain** (EC execution plan)

## B3) The closure sequence (step-by-step, procedural)

1. **Trigger Receipt Created**
   * A gauge reading, incident report, or enforcement writ is logged to a docket number.
2. **Pre-Closure Read**
   * Assay lantern and/or Brin Gauge read is taken and logged (even for WC, because QC is the easiest excuse on earth).
3. **Order Issued**
   * Closure slip created with: class, affected cuts, start tick, expected reopen tick, and responsible Order company (if any).
4. **Posting and Clocking**
   * Slip posted to the board rail (new posts only; old to Else rail).
   * Gateclock board advances to a marked closure notch for the relevant window.
5. **Physical Lock State Set**
   * Teeth engaged, braces seated, spill governors set to closure posture.
   * If the cut is navigable, **tick beacons** are set to “no-cadence” so convoys can’t plausibly claim confusion.
6. **Seal Actions**
   * Cargo already in-lane is either: sealed in place, routed to Wash Lane, or rebooked.
   * Custody seals applied to any bonded lots halted mid-route.
7. **Verification Pass**
   * A second read is taken and logged after lock state is set (this is how they prove the closure “worked”).

## B4) Reopen protocol (how it ends)

Reopen requires:

* a logged **post-closure read** (assay, silt, governor stability),
* a **brace receipt** (what was done, what was replaced),
* and a new posted slip with the reopen tick.

If QC was the class, reopen typically adds: purge kit use logged, wash lanes expanded, and admissibility notes updated.

## B5) Abuse points (how villains stay “legal”)

* **Rolling closures:** close adjacent cuts in sequence to trap a competitor convoy without “targeting” them on paper.
* **QC laundering:** use minor bloom film as a QC justification to seize unrelated cargo as “unsafe.”
* **Works pretext:** schedule “maintenance” exactly when Belt convoys arrive, then blame scarcity on biology.
* **Selective admissibility:** reopen, but only accept seals from certain benches “pending review.”

Puljitos doesn’t need moustache-twirling. It has forms.

# APPENDIX C — Seal House Landscape v1.0

Seal Houses are not mystical. They are  **validity factories** . They decide what counts as “tampered,” “admissible,” and “processable.”

## C1) The three major Knalvossak Seal Houses

Each House has a distinct **fracture geometry** in its resin culture. That becomes both branding and forensics.

### 1) **House Verran** (high-volume cargo truth)

* **Domain:** bonded lots, convoy seals, quay custody
* **Political posture:** Commission-aligned; prefers stability and throughput
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **ladder lines** (parallel craze bands)
* **Forensic tell:** ladder spacing is consistent; counterfeit resin shows uneven banding under lantern raking.

### 2) **House Kelm** (people and passage truth)

* **Domain:** identity admissibility, passage papers, blacklist notes
* **Political posture:** quiet power; closest to Selren’s “clean passage” doctrine
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **comb teeth** (one spine with regular tooth cracks)
* **Forensic tell:** comb spines “step” at a predictable angle; plate-swapped stamps leave angle mismatch.

### 3) **House Orvek** (device and tool truth)

* **Domain:** tool admissibility, mate set certification, mantle service records
* **Political posture:** industry-first; tied to Pinsvek and Gatvek makers
* **Seal behavior:** fractures in **star bursts** (radial spokes from a single point)
* **Forensic tell:** true Orvek stars have a tight center bloom; adulterated paste blooms too wide and chalks at the edges.

## C2) Outbench reality (Krovam and Raskesh)

* **Krovam Bench:** weaker authority, constantly challenged by Knalvossak benches; often forced to over-document to be believed.
* **Raskesh Bench:** aggressive triage posture; tries to make export bonding “good enough,” which Knalvossak uses as a reason to distrust it.

## C3) How Seal Houses fight (non-violent, devastating)

* tighten admissibility requirements (more proof steps)
* issue “review holds” that function as embargoes
* selectively accept or reject outbench stamps
* sponsor Order contracts indirectly by declaring things “unsafe”
