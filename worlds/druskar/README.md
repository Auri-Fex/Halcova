## The Pitch

*Knalvossak sits on the last reliable hardground before the Labyrinth swallows everything into probability. Here, the Canal Commission controls when things move, the Seal Houses decide what's real, and the Order Companies make sure everyone pays. Three magic systems have been industrialized into infrastructure: luck as a tradeable debt, time as a harvestable fuel, and density as an engineering tool. Every use leaves evidence. Bureaucracy has teeth.*

*Every favor is a debt. Every promise is a contract. There's no such thing as free shelter. The paperwork is real. The devices are real. But you're still bleeding through.*

*And somewhere in the gate queues and seal benches and assay lanes, there's a story waiting to be told.*
