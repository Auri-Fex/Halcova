## Thematic Pillars

### LAW vs OATH vs HOSPITALITY
*Every favor is a debt, every promise is a contract, and there's no such thing as free shelter.*

| Force | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Law** | Commission protocols, closure orders, admissibility |
| **Oath** | Order contracts, Fortune Claims, bonded obligations |
| **Hospitality** | *Absent*—shelter costs, help creates debt |

### ARTIFICE vs SOUL
*The paperwork is real. The devices are real. But you're still bleeding through.*

| Force | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Artifice** | Devices, documents, seals—survival through erasure |
| **Soul** | Innate ability, authentic self—liability that leaves evidence |

**Central Question:** *What does it cost to stay human in a world that prices everything?*
