## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Timeline Collision (Reading/Constrained) ✅ FIXED

**Original Problem:** Both stories claimed significant events on Pattern Day eve/night:
- The Reading: Fèinnav meets Àrnnav on Pattern Day
- The Constrained: Break-in happens on "Pattern Day eve"

**Solution Implemented:**
- The Reading v4: Pattern Day is the FIRST meeting between Fèinnav and Àrnnav, establishing initial alliance
- The Constrained v3: Break-in now occurs "two weeks and one day after Pattern Day"
- This allows time for the alliance to develop before escalation

### 2. Grave Ledger Paradox (Bleed) ✅ FIXED

**Original Problem:** Cèresnav's ledger was supposedly hidden at his wife's grave 37 years ago, but contained entries like "Fèinnav Còcalnòc... ink not even dry" (recent)

**Solution Implemented - TWO-LEDGER SYSTEM:**

1. **Cèresnav's Original Ledger** (at wife's grave)
   - Hidden 37 years ago, before his death
   - Contains: His personal letter to daughter, explanation of fraud methodology, his observations from when alive
   - Historical proof that the SYSTEM exists

2. **Còcalnòc Household Ledger** (in father's study)
   - Active family records maintained over generations
   - Contains: Current entries including Fèinnav's fraudulent binding
   - Ongoing proof of CURRENT fraud

**How Evidence Flows:**
- Vèirnav receives memories of the system (from Cèresnav's bleed)
- Vèirnav finds Cèresnav's letter at grave → gives to Vìzrav
- Fèinnav finds household ledger in father's study (The Reading)
- Àrnnav steals strongbox documents (The Constrained)
- Together: Historical methodology + current proof = complete evidence chain

### 3. De-Templating ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Original Problem:** Repetitive phrases across stories:
- "smelled like X and secrets" (appeared in multiple stories)
- Similar opening structures
- Template-feeling descriptions

**Solution Implemented:**
- The Reading v4: Changed to unique sensory descriptions
- Bleed v3: Fresh language throughout
- The Constrained v3: Unique descriptive approach

**Remaining:** The Warden and The Woven could benefit from minor language polish

### 4. Document Taxonomy ✅ CLARIFIED

**Final Document Structure:**

| Document | Location | Found By | Contains |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cèresnav's Letter | Wife's grave | Vèirnav → Vìzrav | Historical proof of system, methodology |
| Household Ledger | Father's study | Fèinnav | Ongoing fraud records, family entries |
| Strongbox Papers | Office safe | Àrnnav | Subset of household records, silencing orders |
| Shadow Copies | Distributed | Èitar, allies | Reproductions for leverage |
