# The Fonváros Triptych: Overview

## Three Linked Stories

Three interconnected short stories set in Fonváros during Year 476, exploring the city through different lenses: the fate system, magical practice, and class dynamics. Each story stands alone but shares characters, events, and thematic threads that reward reading all three.

**Shared Timeline**: All three stories occur during the same nine-day week in Napfény (month 8, Láng season), leading up to and including Pattern Day (Napforduló).

## The Stories

### Story One: "The Reading"
**POV**: Sára Mészáros, 15, merchant's daughter
**Logline**: On the eve of her Binding Draw, a merchant's daughter discovers that the pattern she's about to receive has already been decided—and not by Fate.
**Arc**: Faith → doubt → complicated acceptance
**Themes**: Information asymmetry, free will vs. determinism, complicity in corrupt systems

### Story Two: "Bleed"
**POV**: Gábor Árnyék, 41, Core Binder
**Logline**: A Core Binder's most reliable echo begins remembering things from its life—things the Warden Order wants kept forgotten.
**Arc**: Control → confusion → loss → choice about identity
**Themes**: Identity erosion, the economy of death, sunk cost fallacy, ethics of binding

### Story Three: "The Constrained"
**POV**: Erzsi Kovácsné, 17, laundress and criminal
**Logline**: A pattern-constrained worker in the Hand Quarter must choose between her family's survival and becoming the kind of person her pattern says she already is.
**Arc**: Survival → moral crisis → transformation
**Themes**: Structural oppression, self-fulfilling prophecy, solidarity vs. escape

## Thematic Resonance

All three stories ask: **What does the pattern mean?**

- **Sára**: Learns her pattern is a lie, must live with the truth
- **Gábor**: Learns that patterns persist beyond death, must let go
- **Erzsi**: Learns her true pattern, must decide whether to fulfill or defy it

All three protagonists face **ledgers**:
- Sára: The Registry that records lies
- Gábor: The memories Márton kept
- Erzsi: The documents that prove murder

All three must make **choices the system didn't predict**:
- Sára: Chooses knowing over ignorance
- Gábor: Chooses honoring over owning
- Erzsi: Chooses survival on her terms over survival on theirs

- Ledger revelation deepens with each story

**Alternative**: Story Three → Story Two → Story One
- Starts from the bottom, works up
- Reveals the corruption last
- More mystery, less dramatic irony
