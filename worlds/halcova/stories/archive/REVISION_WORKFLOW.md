# Hálcova Fonváros Quintet - Comprehensive Revision Workflow

## Objective
Revise all five stories to achieve 5/5 rating across all Beta Reader Checklist categories, with particular focus on:
1. **Name diversity** - Reduce suffix repetition in character names
2. **AI detection** - Eliminate AI-typical patterns
3. **Craft excellence** - Meet all story structure and voice requirements

---

## Phase 1: Name Audit & Redistribution

### Current Suffix Distribution Guidelines (from naming_conventions.md)

| Suffix | Maximum % | Maximum Count (per 50) |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| -nav (self) | 15% | 7 |
| -cal (heart) | 20% | 10 |
| -rav (bond) | 15% | 7 |
| -tar (path) | 15% | 7 |
| -maht (death) | 10% | 5 |
| -àhd (covenant) | 10% | 5 |
| -cai (duty) | 10% | 5 |
| -dav (blood alt) | 5% | 2 |
| -cad (fate) | 10% | 5 |
| Other affixes | 5% each | 2 each |

### Story-by-Story Name Analysis Needed

For each story, we need to:
1. List all character names with their suffixes
2. Identify over-represented suffixes
3. Replace names to achieve better distribution
4. Ensure name meanings still fit character arcs
