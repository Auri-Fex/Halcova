| **Warden** | - | - | - | Òràhd (guard-covenant) | Vàscalìn | -àhd (1) |

### Suffix Totals for This Story
- **-nav (self)**: 4 occurrences (Fèinnav, Thòronnav, Àrnnav) + line name Hàlmahtfhì
- **-cal (heart)**: 3 occurrences (Còcal, Sèvcal, Vàscalìn)
- **-maht (death)**: 4 occurrences (Csèndmaht, Tòvismaht x2, Hàlmahtfhì)
- **-rav (bond)**: 1 occurrence (Vìzrav)
- **-tar (path)**: 3 occurrences (Szòvòtar, Vèszttar)
- **-àhd (covenant)**: 2 occurrences (Cèresztàhd, Òràhd)

### Problems Identified
1. **-nav suffix overused**: 4 occurrences in a single story exceeds variety guidelines
2. **-maht suffix overused**: 4 occurrences, particularly problematic with the echo named Csèndmaht
3. **-cal appears acceptable**: 3 occurrences

### Recommended Name Changes

#### Priority 1: Reduce -nav repetition
**Option A**: Change mother's name
- Current: Vìzrav (water-bound) → Thòronnav (tower-self)
- **Proposed**: Vìzrav (keep) → **Thòroncai** (tower-bound/duty)
  - Maintains water-imagery in given name
  - Changes Fate from -nav to -cai
  - Still reflects her actual pattern (structure + wound)

#### Priority 2: Reduce -maht repetition
**Option B**: Change echo's name
- Current: Csèndmaht (silence-death)
- **Proposed**: **Csèndsak** (silence-silent/still)
  - Uses the -sak suffix (from sakit) which is underutilized (5% max)
  - Still captures the eerie quiet of the echo
  - Maintains the "Csènd" root

**Option C**: Change Szòvòtar's Line name
- Current: Hàlmahtfhì (son of death-silence)
- **Proposed**: **Hàlcalfhì** (son of death-heart) or **Hàlravfhì** (son of death-bond)
  - Maintains ominous "Hàl" (death) root
  - Reduces -maht count

#### Priority 3: Consider diversity
**Option D**: Change Hand Quarter girl's Given name (lower priority)
- Current: Àrnnav (shadow-self)
- **Proposed**: **Àrncad** (shadow-fate) or **Àrnsak** (shadow-still)
  - Maintains shadow imagery
  - Introduces different suffix
  - Note: This change affects continuity across quintet

### Recommended Final Names for "The Reading"

| Character | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Protagonist | Fèinnav | **Fèinnav** (keep) | Central character, name works |
| Father | Còcal | **Còcal** (keep) | Stone-heart imagery important |
| Mother | Vìzrav → Thòronnav | **Vìzrav → Thòroncai** | Reduces -nav, maintains meaning |
| Echo | Csèndmaht | **Csèndsak** | Reduces -maht, captures stillness |
| Reader | Szòvòtar Hàlmahtfhì | **Szòvòtar Hàlcalfhì** | Reduces -maht in line name |
| Hand Quarter | Àrnnav | **Àrnnav** (keep for now) | Review across quintet |
| Warden | Òràhd Vàscalìn | **Òràhd Vàscalìn** (keep) | Name works well |

### Revised Suffix Count After Changes
- **-nav**: 2 (Fèinnav, Àrnnav) ✓ Much better
- **-cal**: 3 (Còcal, Sèvcal, Hàlcalfhì, Vàscalìn) ✓ Acceptable
- **-maht**: 2 (Tòvismaht x2) ✓ Acceptable
- **-cai**: 1 (Thòroncai) ✓ Good
- **-sak**: 1 (Csèndsak) ✓ Using underutilized suffix
- **-rav**: 1 (Vìzrav) ✓ Good
- **-tar**: 2 (Szòvòtar, Vèszttar) ✓ Good
- **-àhd**: 2 (Cèresztàhd, Òràhd) ✓ Good

## Beta Reader Checklist Evaluation

### 1. Clarity + Orientation: **4/5**

**Strengths:**
- POV is clear (Fèinnav throughout)
- Scene transitions generally obvious
- Setting well-established

**Issues:**
- Line 347-350: The Hand Quarter girl is called "Àrnnav" by "someone" but reader doesn't know who spoke
- Line 892-894: Csèndmaht's memory fragment could be clearer about whose house she's remembering
- The echo/bleed mechanic needs one more line of explanation in Part One

**Fixes Needed:**
- Add dialogue tag when Àrnnav's name is first mentioned
- Clarify that the lavender house was grandfather's earlier
- Add one sentence explaining what echoes are

**Target: 5/5**

---

### 2. Hook + Momentum: **5/5**

**Strengths:**
- Immediate hook with Csèndmaht's remembered gestures
- First wrongness catalog is compelling
- Discovery in alcove is perfectly paced
- Escalation clear throughout

**No issues identified**

---

### 3. Stakes + Motivation: **5/5**

**Strengths:**
- Fèinnav's terror is palpable and specific
- Her motivation to understand is clear
- Stakes escalate naturally (personal → family → systemic)
- "What am I?" question drives entire narrative

**No issues identified**

---

### 4. Character Voice: **4/5**

**Strengths:**
- Fèinnav's observational POV is distinct
- Parents' evasiveness feels authentic
- Szòvòtar's grandfatherly menace is perfect

**Issues:**
- Lines 1247-1250: Àrnnav's cynicism occasionally sounds too polished
- Lines 567-570: Father's dialogue feels slightly expository ("The Szòvòtar is old..." / "He's conducted...")

**Fixes Needed:**
- Make Àrnnav's speech more clipped, less complete sentences
- Father's exposition: break up with action beats or mother's interruption

**Target: 5/5**

---

### 5. Dialogue Quality: **5/5**

**Strengths:**
- Most dialogue serves multiple purposes
- Subtext strong throughout
- No therapy-speak detected
- Characters withhold/evade naturally

**No significant issues**

---

### 6. Showing vs. Explaining: **4/5**

**Strengths:**
- The bribe scene is perfectly dramatized
- Fèinnav's internal processing is shown through body
- Discovery of ledger is visceral

**Issues:**
- Lines 1689-1695: The explanation of truth vs. interpretation feels slightly expository
- Lines 2145-2150: Pattern Day setup is told more than shown

**Fixes Needed:**
- Break up Szòvòtar's explanation with Fèinnav's reactions
- Show Pattern Day through sensory details first, context second

**Target: 5/5**

---

### 7. Repetition + Redundancy: **3/5** ⚠️

**Major Issues Identified:**

**Repeated Phrases:**
- "Something" appears 47 times (crutch word)
  - "something complicated" (3x)
  - "something that looked like..." (5x)
  - "something + adjective" pattern overused
- "The echo's hands" (8 times in Part One alone)
- "Pattern-privileged" / "pattern-constrained" (31 times - necessary but could vary phrasing)
- Face "did something complicated" (2x - exact phrase)

**Sentence Structure Repetition:**
- Multiple paragraphs starting with "The [noun]" pattern
- "She [verb]ed. She [verb]ed. She [verb]ed." structure appears 6 times

**Fixes Needed:**
- Replace 30+ instances of vague "something" with specific descriptions
- Vary "echo's hands" with "Csèndsak's fingers," "those dead hands," "the borrowed gesture"
- Find synonyms for pattern-privileged/constrained or restructure sentences
- Eliminate repeated "did something complicated" - describe the complexity
- Vary sentence openers throughout

**Target: 5/5** (Requires substantial revision)

---

### 8. Specificity + Texture: **4/5**

**Strengths:**
- Sensory details strong (jasmine, incense, coffee steam)
- The ledger's physical details (red leather, black ribbon)
- Festival atmosphere vivid

**Issues:**
- Lines 234-237: "polished wood and morning light" is generic
- Lines 1156-1159: Temple architecture could be more specific
- Hand Quarter description lacks unique identifying features beyond "rot and waste"

**Fixes Needed:**
- Breakfast room: add specific furniture details, family heirlooms
- Temple: specific architectural features that show wealth/power
- Hand Quarter: specific businesses, street names, distinctive buildings

**Target: 5/5**

---

**No issues identified**

---

### 12. AI Draft Red Flags: **3/5** ⚠️

**Issues Identified:**

**Symmetrical Sentences:**
- Line 445-447: "Not the lie... Not the raw read... Something new. Something chosen."
  - Classic AI parallel structure
- Line 892-895: "There was a child... There was a man... There was a ledger..."
  - Repetitive "There was" structure

**Generic Intensifiers:**
- "very" appears 2 times (acceptable but check context)
- "completely" appears 3 times
- "totally" appears 0 times (good)

**Over-explained Metaphors:**
- Lines 178-180: "cracks in porcelain" followed by immediate explanation
- Lines 2301-2305: The pen/ledger metaphor is stated rather than felt

**Instant Certainty:**
- Lines 1678-1680: "She knew that with a certainty that went deeper than thought"
  - Tells rather than shows the knowing

**Fixes Needed:**
- Break up parallel "Not X... Not Y... Something Z" structure with action
- Vary sentence structures in repetitive sections
- Remove or rewrite over-explained metaphors
- Show Fèinnav's certainty through physical sensation instead of telling it

**Target: 5/5** (Requires line-level polish)
