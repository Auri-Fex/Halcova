## Common Issues Identified (Apply to Stories 02-05)

### Critical Patterns to Watch:
1. **"Something" as crutch word** - Keep under 15 instances per story
2. **Repetitive descriptors** - Track phrases that appear 3+ times
3. **Parallel structures** - Avoid "Not X... Not Y... Something Z" patterns
4. **Over-explained metaphors** - Let images speak for themselves
5. **Sentence structure repetition** - Vary paragraph openers
6. **Generic worldbuilding** - Add specific cultural/architectural details
7. **Exposition dumps** - Break up with action/reaction beats
8. **Instant certainty tells** - Show through physical sensation

### Successful Techniques to Replicate:
1. **Sensory grounding** in opening paragraphs
2. **Action-integrated worldbuilding** - details through movement
3. **Varied paragraph openers** - no more than 2 similar in 5-paragraph sections
4. **Character-specific speech** - sentence length, vocabulary, patterns
5. **Deep POV with physical sensation** - body awareness throughout
6. **Specific cultural details** - not just "wealthy" but "how wealthy shows"
7. **Natural class terminology variation** - multiple ways to describe hierarchy

## Lessons Learned - Story 01 Revision

### What Worked Well:
- **Single comprehensive pass** rather than multiple small revisions
- **Systematic approach**: Names first, then repetition, then AI tells, then polish
- **Clear targets**: Knowing exact numbers to hit (e.g., "something" <15)
- **Specific replacements**: Having concrete alternatives ready

### Challenges Encountered:
- **Balancing variation with clarity**: Some repetition serves readability
- **Maintaining voice while removing AI tells**: Can't just delete, must rewrite authentically
- **Worldbuilding additions**: Adding detail without slowing momentum

### Time Investment:
- **Analysis & Planning**: 2-3 hours
- **Actual Revision**: 5-6 hours
- **Total**: ~8 hours for 11,850-word story
- **Efficiency**: ~1,500 words per hour with comprehensive revisions
