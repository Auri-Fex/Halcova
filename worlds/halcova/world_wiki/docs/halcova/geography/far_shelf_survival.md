# The Far Shelf: Why Anyone Lives There

## The Problem

The Far Shelf is:
- The coldest inhabited region
- The most distant from trade centers
- The poorest in conventional Residue access
- The thinnest in Loom coverage
- The harshest in growing conditions

Why does anyone live there? Why hasn't the population simply migrated to better regions?

## The Answer: The Ancient Residue Deposits

### What They Are

The Far Shelf sits atop the largest concentration of ancient, pre-Transformation Residue deposits on Hálcova.

**The Formation:**
When the Transformation occurred, the population collapse was most severe in what is now the Far Shelf. Millions died in the first centuries of the cooling. Their Residue wasn't collected (no one was organized enough to collect it). It accumulated.

For forty-five thousand years, this Residue sat in the permafrost:
- Concentrated in ancient death sites
- Preserved by the extreme cold
- Slowly compressed into dense deposits
- Creating something like "Residue ore"

**The Quality:**
Ancient Residue is different from fresh Residue:
- Much denser (10-50x concentration)
- More stable (doesn't degrade as quickly)
- Higher pattern-content (older patterns, more complex)
- Better for certain applications (especially magic, Loom operations)
