# Fonváros: The Heartlands Capital

## Overview

**Fonváros** (FON-vah-rohsh, "Thread-city") is the capital of the Heartlands and the largest city in Hálcova, with a population of approximately 250,000. It serves as the seat of the Crown, the headquarters of the Concordat, and the central node of the Loom network.

The city's name derives from an ancient term for the threads of fate—Fonváros is where the threads converge, where patterns are read, where destiny is administered.

## Geography and Layout

Fonváros sits at the confluence of two major rivers:

The city occupies both riverbanks and several islands where the rivers meet, connected by numerous bridges.
