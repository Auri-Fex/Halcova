<div class="halcova-header">Hálcova: Legal Frameworks and Pattern Law</div>

> **Document Scope**: This document details *legal systems and pattern-crimes*—the taxonomy of offenses, court structures, and enforcement mechanisms. For regional governance structures, see [governance_structures.md](governance_structures.md). For philosophical questions about pattern-governance, see [political_philosophy.md](political_philosophy.md). For a comprehensive overview combining all aspects, see [politics_law_and_systems.md](politics_law_and_systems.md).

## Overview

Law in [Hálcova](../../index.md) cannot escape [pattern](../fate_system/the_sorscad.md). The existence of readable fate, predictable behavior, and measurable destiny forces every legal system to answer questions Earth jurisprudence never faced: Can you punish inevitability? Can you contract against destiny? Is [deviation](legal_frameworks.md#deviation) a crime or a miracle?

Different regions answer differently. All answers cost something.

## The Taxonomy of Pattern-Crimes

### Deviation

**Definition**: Acting against your pattern's predictions.

**The Problem**: If patterns are divine (Orthodox view) or physically real (materialist view), deviation is either sin or impossibility. Yet it happens. Some people act against prediction.

**Orthodox Position**: Deviation is heresy. The pattern is [The Weaver&#39;s](../society/religion.md) will; defying it defies divine order. Punishment is spiritual correction as much as temporal.

**Skeptic Position**: Deviation proves patterns are probabilistic, not deterministic. "Deviants" are just statistical outliers. Criminalizing deviation criminalizes being unpredicted.

**Actual Practice**: [Heartlands](../planetary/geography.md) criminalizes deviation. [Shattered Reaches](../planetary/geography.md) doesn't (officially). Other regions vary. The [Warden Order](../society/the_warden_order.md) prosecutes deviation everywhere it can reach, creating jurisdictional conflicts.

---

### Pattern Fraud

**Definition**: Misrepresenting your pattern to gain advantage.

**Subtypes**:

*Identity Fraud*: Claiming to be someone with a different pattern. Using someone else's pattern-documentation.

*Reading Fraud*: Providing false pattern-readings. Bribing Loom-readers. Using counterfeit pattern-engines.

*Prediction Fraud*: Claiming false predictions to manipulate others. "The Loom says you'll fail unless you pay me."

*Suppression Fraud*: Hiding your pattern when legally required to disclose. Employment fraud. Marriage fraud. Contract fraud.

**Why It Matters**: Pattern information has economic value. The entire credit, insurance, and employment system rests on pattern accuracy. Fraud attacks the foundation.

**Enforcement**: Heavy everywhere. Even the Far Shelf, which hates pattern-tracking, punishes fraudulent misrepresentation. The crime isn't having a pattern—it's lying about it.

---

### Pattern Evasion

**Definition**: Avoiding pattern-reading or removing yourself from the Loom's tracking.

**The Gray Area**: Is it illegal to simply... leave? To go where the Loom doesn't reach? To refuse readings?

**Orthodox Position**: Evasion is proto-deviation. Why avoid the Loom unless you plan to deviate? Evasion is suspicious and warrants investigation.

**Autonomist Position**: You own your pattern. Refusing to share it is your right. Mandatory reading is slavery.

**Actual Practice**:

The Heartlands requires pattern documentation for most activities. No reading, no employment, no housing, no trade. Evasion isn't explicitly illegal—you just can't participate in society.

The Far Shelf explicitly protects pattern-privacy. Forced reading is assault.

Other regions fall between.

---

### Pattern Interference

**Definition**: Manipulating someone else's pattern without consent.

**Theoretical Nature**: May not be possible. May be mythical. The uncertainty is part of the legal problem.

**Legal Treatment**:

Illegal everywhere—in theory. But if it's impossible, the laws are purely symbolic. If it's possible and secret, the laws are unenforceable.

The Warden Order maintains that interference is real and they've prosecuted it. Skeptics note that "interference" explains away prediction failures conveniently.

**The Burden of Proof**: How do you prove someone's pattern was interfered with? The pattern is what it is now. You'd need evidence of what it was before—which requires trusting old readings, which could also have been fraudulent.

---

### Pattern Trafficking

**Definition**: Trading in pattern information without authorization.

**The Market**: Pattern data has value. Employers want it. Lenders want it. Families want it. Criminals want it. There's money in knowing someone's pattern.

**Legal Status**:

*Authorized Access*: Loom-readers, Wardens, certain officials can access patterns legitimately.

*Regulated Trade*: Some jurisdictions allow pattern-data sale with consent. Buy someone's pattern-reading for credit approval? Legal if they agreed.

*Black Market*: Unauthorized readings. Stolen data. Readings sold without subject's knowledge. Illegal everywhere.

**The Infrastructure**: Pattern trafficking requires access to Loom-engines, which are controlled. Black market depends on corrupt readers, stolen equipment, or unregulated nodes.

---

## Contract Law and Pattern

### The Enforceability Problem

A contract is a meeting of minds, creating mutual obligation. But on Hálcova:

- The Loom knew you'd sign before you did
- Your pattern may have made signing inevitable
- Your future capacity to fulfill was predictable
- The other party may have known your pattern and exploited it

**When Is a Contract Void?**

*Pattern Exploitation*: If one party knew the other's pattern predicted failure, and structured the deal to profit from that failure, is the contract predatory?

**Orthodox Position**: Patterns are public information. Using it is prudent, not exploitative. Caveat emptor.

**Reformist Position**: Information asymmetry this extreme vitiates consent. Pattern-exploitation contracts should be voidable.

*Prediction Manipulation*: If the contract was designed to create the outcome the pattern predicted—if the prediction is self-fulfilling *because* the contract makes it so—is that fraud?

**Example**: Lender gives loan to "failure pattern" debtor at crushing terms. Terms guarantee failure. Lender profits from failure. The pattern was accurate because the contract made it accurate.

*Deviation Clauses*: Some contracts include provisions for deviation. "If Party A deviates from predicted behavior, contract is void." This incentivizes pattern-compliance—or punishes the rare genuine choice.

---

### Pattern-Contingent Contracts

Contracts explicitly tied to pattern outcomes:

**Futures**: "I will pay X if your pattern manifests outcome Y."

**Insurance**: "I will cover losses from outcome Y unless pattern indicated Y."

**Bonds**: "My pattern predicts success; I bond myself against failure."

**Marriage**: "We agree to join contingent on compatible patterns remaining compatible."

These contracts treat pattern as fact—and create massive markets around prediction accuracy.

---

### The Assignment Problem

Can you transfer your pattern? Your fate? Your predicted outcomes?

**No**: Pattern is inherent. You can't give someone else your destiny.

**Sort Of**: You can transfer *economic interests* in your pattern. Sell shares in your predicted success. Assign rights to your Residue upon death. Create instruments based on your predicted trajectory.

**Resulting Instruments**:

*Fate Futures*: Tradeable contracts based on predicted pattern-outcomes.

*Death Bonds*: Instruments that pay upon subject's death (incentives get dark quickly).

*Residue Rights*: Assignable claims to the Residue someone's death will produce.

These markets exist, are regulated inconsistently, and create incentives the designers probably didn't intend.

## Criminal Procedure and Pattern

### Pattern Evidence in Criminal Trials

**Prosecution Use**: "Defendant's pattern includes 'will commit violence.' This act was predicted. Defendant is the predicted perpetrator."

**Defense Use**: "Defendant's pattern doesn't include this crime. The Loom didn't predict it. Wrong suspect."

**The Problem**: Pattern evidence is probabilistic. Patterns don't specify every action. A "violence pattern" doesn't mean this specific violence. A clean pattern doesn't mean incapable of crime.

**Actual Practice**:

Heartlands: Pattern evidence is admissible, weighted, but not dispositive. Pattern supports other evidence; rarely convicts alone.

Shattered Reaches: Pattern evidence officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely.

Vent Lands: Pattern evidence is secondary to material evidence. Actions matter more than predictions.

Far Shelf: Pattern evidence excluded. "Patterns don't commit crimes; people do."

---

### Pre-Crime Intervention

**The Temptation**: The Loom predicts future behavior. Why wait for the crime?

**Arguments For**:

- Prevention is better than punishment
- Victims are protected before they're harmed
- Deterrence works better when intervention precedes action

**Arguments Against**:

- Punishing non-actions is unjust
- Prediction isn't certainty; innocents will be punished
- Creates the outcome it predicts (treating someone as criminal makes them criminal)
- Where does it end? Every "bad pattern" becomes pre-criminal?

**Actual Practice**:

Heartlands: Limited pre-crime intervention. "Dangerous patterns" may be monitored, required to register, restricted in travel or occupation. Actual detention requires additional evidence.

Other regions: Generally reject pre-crime detention. Monitoring may occur.

Far Shelf: Explicitly prohibits pattern-based pre-crime action. "The crime is the crime. The pattern is not the crime."

---

### Sentencing and Pattern

If pattern predicts recidivism, should sentences be longer?

**Incapacitation Argument**: Long sentences for high-recidivism patterns protect society. The prediction justifies the extension.

**Justice Argument**: Punishment should fit the crime committed, not crimes predicted. Sentencing the future is unjust.

**Practical Reality**: Most jurisdictions use pattern information in sentencing, openly or covertly. Judges are human; they have access; they use it.

**The Data**: Jurisdictions that pattern-adjust sentences show... complex results. Lower recidivism among released (because predicted-recidivists serve longer). But higher total incarceration. And the prediction accuracy is confounded by the intervention.

---

## Family Law and Pattern

### Marriage and Pattern-Compatibility

**The Practice**: Pattern-readings are standard before marriage in most regions. Incompatible patterns are disclosed. Compatible patterns are celebrated.

**The Question**: Should pattern-incompatibility void a marriage?

**Orthodox Position**: Incompatible patterns should prevent marriage. Marrying against pattern is deviation.

**Romantic Position**: Love transcends pattern. Compatibility reading is information, not mandate.

**Actual Practice**: Heartlands requires compatibility reading; strongly discourages incompatible unions; doesn't technically forbid them. Other regions vary.

**The Failure Case**: If a marriage fails, and the patterns predicted failure, who's responsible? Did they deviate by marrying? Did they fail to deviate sufficiently to save it?

---

### Inheritance and Pattern

**The Issue**: If your pattern predicts wealth-accumulation, is your wealth "earned"? If your heir's pattern predicts squandering, should they inherit?

**Orthodox Position**: Wealth flows according to pattern. Inheritance is pattern-expression. Let it flow.

**Reformist Position**: Pattern-based inheritance entrenches inequality. Use inheritance taxes, estate limitations, pattern-blind distribution.

**Actual Practice**: Heartlands allows pattern-conditional inheritance ("to my heir, unless their pattern indicates X"). Other regions vary.

---

### Custody and Pattern

**The Nightmare Case**: Parents divorcing. Child's pattern is read. One parent's pattern is "compatible with child-raising." Other's isn't. Who gets custody?

**Pattern-Determinists**: Pattern-compatible parent should raise the child. Outcomes will be better. The evidence is predictive.

**Pattern-Skeptics**: Parenting isn't predictable this way. Pattern-reading is too coarse. Use traditional best-interests analysis.

**Actual Practice**: Pattern evidence is used in custody disputes almost everywhere, despite controversy. Judges claim it's one factor among many. Critics note it's often decisive.

---

## Property Law and Pattern

### Acquisition and Pattern

If your pattern predicts you'll acquire property X, and you acquire property X, did you "earn" it? If someone else's pattern predicted they'd acquire X, and you got it instead, did you steal their destiny?

**The Orthodox Answer**: Pattern predicts, doesn't entitle. You own what you legally acquire. Pattern is descriptive, not prescriptive.

**The Uncomfortable Implication**: Pattern-privileged people will acquire more, reliably. This isn't injustice—it's fate. The system is working correctly.

**The Reformist Answer**: Pattern-advantage is unearned. Tax it. Redistribute from pattern-privileged to pattern-constrained.

---

### Residue Rights

When someone dies, their Pattern Residue is released. Who owns it?

**Traditional View**: The estate. Residue rights are property, inheritable, transferable.

**Reform View**: Residue belongs to the community. The death happened here; the Residue should serve here.

**Radical View**: Residue shouldn't be property. It's sacred / dangerous / collective. Commodifying death commodifies people.

**Actual Practice**: Residue is property almost everywhere. The economic system depends on it. Reform efforts have failed. Radical positions are marginalized.

---

### The Loom's Property Status

Who owns the Loom?

**Orthodox Position**: The Loom is divine infrastructure. No one owns it. The Church administers it on behalf of The Weaver.

**Secular Position**: The Loom is technology. Someone built it. Someone maintains it. That someone has property interests.

**Practical Answer**: The Loom is controlled by the Orthodox Church in the Heartlands. Nodes elsewhere have various ownership (government, guild, private). The underlying infrastructure—whatever enables the Attendance to answer—is not owned because it's not understood.

---

## Warden Order Legal Authority

### Jurisdictional Claims

The Warden Order claims authority to:

- Investigate pattern-crimes anywhere patterns exist
- Arrest deviants, fraudsters, evaders, interferers
- Conduct trials (ecclesiastical courts in Heartlands, treaty-authorized elsewhere)
- Execute sentences including death (Pattern-Severance)

### Basis for Authority

**In Heartlands**: Embedded in government. Warden authority is state authority.

**In Shattered Reaches**: Treaty-based. Specific rights negotiated with specific polities. Varies by jurisdiction.

**In Middle Waters**: Colonial extension. Wardens operate in Heartlands-controlled zones. Contested elsewhere.

**In Vent Lands**: Guild-negotiated limits. Wardens can pursue specific crimes with guild cooperation. No independent authority.

**In Far Shelf**: Rejected. Wardens are foreign agents without legal standing. Operating openly risks arrest.

### Conflicts

**Extradition**: Heartlands demands extradition of deviants from other regions. Other regions sometimes comply (valuable trade relations), sometimes refuse (sovereignty, ideology).

**Pursuit Rights**: Can Wardens pursue a suspect into non-Heartlands territory? Officially no (without treaty). Actually, they sometimes do.

**Parallel Proceedings**: A crime may be tried under Warden authority and local authority simultaneously. Which verdict controls?

---

## Specific Legal Codes by Region

### Heartlands: The Pattern Code

**Structure**: Ecclesiastical law (pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy) parallel to secular law (ordinary crimes).

**Key Features**:

- Deviation is a crime, prosecuted by Wardens
- Pattern-fraud is both ecclesiastical and secular crime
- Pattern evidence admissible in all courts
- Pre-crime monitoring authorized for "dangerous patterns"
- Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable
- Residue rights are property, regulated but tradeable

**Distinctive Elements**:

- "Pattern Certification" required for many activities
- "Harmony Testing" for marriage, business partnership
- "Fate Compliance Audits" for major institutions
- Death sentences produce Residue assigned to state

---

### Shattered Reaches: The Maritime Compact

**Structure**: Common law tradition, precedent-based, decentralized by polity.

**Key Features**:

- Pattern-crimes not generally recognized (fraud excepted)
- Pattern evidence officially excluded from criminal trials
- Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable as private agreements
- Strong arbitration tradition (pattern evidence allowed)
- Residue rights are property, largely unregulated

**Distinctive Elements**:

- "Jurisdictional Shopping" is common and accepted
- Merchant league arbitration often preferred to state courts
- "Pattern Privacy" recognized as right (can refuse disclosure)
- Warden authority limited by specific treaty provisions

---

### Vent Lands: The Guild Protocols

**Structure**: Guild-based law. Guilds govern members; inter-guild conflicts resolved by council.

**Key Features**:

- Expertise/capability matters more than pattern
- Pattern evidence secondary to demonstrated competence
- Contracts based on deliverables, not predictions
- Residue rights regulated by safety guild (toxic substances)
- Non-guild members have limited legal standing

**Distinctive Elements**:

- "Competence Certification" replaces pattern certification
- Guild courts handle member disputes
- Inter-guild trade governed by protocols, not state law
- Wardens limited to specific treaty-defined violations

---

### Far Shelf: The Autonomy Charters

**Structure**: Decentralized. Local charters establish local rules. Weak central coordination.

**Key Features**:

- Pattern-tracking rejected where possible
- Deviation not criminalized (may be celebrated)
- Pattern evidence excluded from legal proceedings
- Strong privacy protections
- Residue rights controversial (some communities refuse commodification)

**Distinctive Elements**:

- "Loom Refusal" protected as right
- Warden presence illegal without invitation
- Community assemblies resolve disputes
- Emphasis on restorative over punitive justice
