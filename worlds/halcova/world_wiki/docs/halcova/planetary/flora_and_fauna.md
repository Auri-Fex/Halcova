<div style="font-size:2em; font-weight:bold; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em;">Hálcova: Flora, Fauna, and Ecology</div>

## Overview

Life on [Hálcova](../../index.md) evolved under conditions radically different from Earth: amber-orange light from a K-type star, cold temperatures, Pattern Residue permeating the environment, and five-moon tidal rhythms. The result is an ecosystem that would seem alien to human eyes—dark vegetation, cold-adapted creatures, and organisms that interact with the exotic matter that defines this world.

## The Light Environment

### Sárgvas Spectrum

The K-type star provides:

- Dominant orange-red light
- Significant infrared
- Reduced ultraviolet
- Less total energy than a G-type star at equivalent distance

### Photosynthesis Adaptation

Earth plants are green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, reflecting green. Under Sárgvas:

- Less blue light available to absorb
- More red and infrared available
- Organisms evolved to absorb different wavelengths

**The Result**: Hálcova's photosynthetic organisms absorb across a wider spectrum, including more infrared. They reflect very little, appearing dark to human-equivalent eyes.

## Flora by Climate Zone

### Polar Transition Zone (Darkest)

**Coloration**: Black to deep charcoal

**Reason**: Maximum light absorption needed; every photon counts

**Dominant Forms**:

*Black Lichen*

- Encrusting growth on rocks, ice-free surfaces
- Survives temperatures to -50°C
- Photosynthesizes during brief light periods
- Contains Pattern Residue-processing compounds (one of the few organisms that can)

*Shadow Moss*

- Thick, carpet-forming moss
- Nearly black, occasionally deep purple
- Insulating properties (creatures nest in it)
- Grows on soil, dead vegetation, abandoned structures

*Pole-Creep*

- Extremely slow-growing woody plant
- Hugs ground, never exceeds 10cm height
- Wood is incredibly dense (centuries of growth compressed)
- Valued for specialized construction

### Temperate Zones (Dark Purple to Deep Red)

**Coloration**: Purple, maroon, deep burgundy

**Reason**: Balance between absorption efficiency and avoiding overheating during Láng

**Dominant Forms**:

*Blackwood Trees*

- Coniferous trees with black bark, dark purple needles
- Grow 20-40m tall in favorable conditions
- Wood is hard, dark, valuable for construction
- Needles contain compounds used in medicine

*Bloodgrass*

- Prairie-forming grass with deep red blades
- Covers temperate lowlands
- Turns nearly black in winter, red in summer
- Feeds grazing herds

*Vein-Vine*

- Climbing plant with purple stems, dark red leaves
- Wraps around other plants or structures
- Produces small berries (edible, bitter)
- Spreads aggressively in disturbed areas

*Duskflowers*

- Flowering plants in various dark hues
- Bloom briefly during Láng
- Pollinated by cold-adapted insects and small flying creatures
- Some species cultivated for dyes, medicine, ritual use

**Forest Character**:
Temperate forests on Hálcova are dark, cathedral-like spaces. The canopy absorbs most light. Undergrowth is sparse where canopy is thick. Sound carries strangely. The amber light filtering through dark needles creates an atmosphere humans find either peaceful or oppressive.

### Middle Waters / Tropical Zone (Brightest)

**Coloration**: Deep red, orange-red, occasional bright orange

**Reason**: Can afford to reflect more light; heat management more important than maximum absorption

**Dominant Forms**:

*Ember Palms*

- Tropical equivalent with frond-like leaves in orange-red
- Multiple species adapted to various island conditions
- Some produce edible fruit
- Wood is light, used for boats and structures

*Fire Ferns*

- Groundcover in bright red-orange
- Thrives in volcanic soil
- Some varieties only grow near geothermal vents

*Coral Equivalent*

- Colonial organisms building reef structures
- Colors vary: red, orange, yellow (brightest organisms on Hálcova)
- Not related to Earth coral—convergent evolution
- Create complex underwater ecosystems

*Steam Orchids*

- Flowering plants near geothermal features
- Spectacular colors (by Hálcova standards): orange, red, occasional yellow
- Rare, valuable, cultivated with difficulty
- Associated with Colony Cults (fungi often grow in same conditions)

### The Color Gradient

| Zone          | Vegetation Color         | Reason                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Polar         | Black                    | Maximum absorption                  |
| High latitude | Charcoal, deep purple    | High absorption, some reflection    |
| Temperate     | Purple, maroon, burgundy | Balanced absorption/reflection      |
| Subtropical   | Deep red, wine           | More reflection for heat management |
| Tropical      | Red, orange-red, orange  | Maximum reflection sustainable      |

## Fauna: General Principles

### Cold Adaptation

All Hálcova fauna evolved for cold conditions:

**Insulation**:

- Thick fur, fat layers, or unique insulating structures
- Some species have hollow hairs (trapped air insulation)
- Aquatic species have dense, oily coats

**Metabolism**:

- Generally slower than Earth equivalents
- Can survive long periods without food
- Hibernation-like states common during Csend
- Quick metabolic bursts for predation/escape

**Size Patterns**:

- Large body size common (better heat retention)
- Small species rare except in Middle Waters
- Pack/herd behavior provides shared warmth

### Pattern Residue Interaction

Most fauna avoids Pattern Residue:

**Residue Sensitivity**:

- High concentrations cause stress, disorientation
- Animals avoid death sites until Residue dissipates
- Migration patterns route around high-Residue areas
- Explains why polar regions lack megafauna (Residue too dense)

**Exceptions**:

- A few specialized species have evolved Residue tolerance
- Some actually feed on or process Residue
- These species are economically important (see below)

## Fungi and the Colony Question

### Natural Fungi

Fungi are ubiquitous on Hálcova:

- Decomposition in cold conditions requires specialized organisms
- Fungi fill ecological niches that bacteria fill on warmer worlds
- Many edible species (carefully distinguished from toxic ones)
- Mycorrhizal networks connect forest ecosystems

**Colors**: Unlike plants, fungi don't photosynthesize. They come in all colors—white, grey, brown, orange, blue, even bioluminescent.

### The Colony Organisms

The fungi used in Colony Summoning are related to but distinct from natural fungi:

**Key Differences**:

- Process Pattern Residue (natural fungi avoid it)
- Form symbiotic bonds with hosts (natural fungi don't)
- Store "patterns" of consumed organisms (natural fungi just decompose)
- Respond to host will (natural fungi have no such interaction)

**Origins Unknown**:

- Did Colony fungi evolve naturally?
- Were they engineered by ancient civilization?
- Did they come from the Elsewhere?
- Are they somehow related to the thing imprisoned at the southern pole?

**Ecological Role**:

- Wild Colony organisms exist (feral colonies)
- They consume dead matter and grow
- Without hosts, they can spread unpredictably
- Some regions have "colony zones"—areas where wild colonies have established
- These zones are dangerous and economically valuable

## Ecosystem Dynamics

### Food Webs

**Temperate Terrestrial**:

```
Vegetation (Blackwood, Bloodgrass) 
    ↓
Primary Consumers (Elk herds, small grazers)
    ↓
Secondary Consumers (Wolf-equivalents, small predators)
    ↓
Apex Predators (Glacier Bears, human hunters)
```

**Marine**:

```
Phytoplankton-equivalent
    ↓
Small fish, filter feeders
    ↓
Medium fish, cephalopods
    ↓
Large fish, marine mammals
    ↓
Leviathans, human fishers
```

### Seasonal Cycles

**Csend (Winter)**:

- Most animals hibernate or reduce activity
- Predators hunt weakened prey
- Frozen carrion preserved for later consumption
- Residue accumulates (less biological processing)

**Olvadás (Thaw)**:

- Awakening, breeding season begins
- Disease spreads from thawed pathogens
- Migratory species return
- Residue releases from ice (flora and fauna respond)

**Láng (Summer)**:

- Peak activity, breeding, feeding
- Maximum biomass
- Predation intense (building reserves)
- Residue at peak atmospheric concentration

**Hanyatlás (Decline)**:

- Preparation for winter
- Migration begins
- Final feeding push
- Residue begins precipitating

**Köd (Veil)**:

- Animal behavior changes (affected by Elsewhere bleed)
- Some species become aggressive
- Some become docile, disoriented
- Colony organisms highly active
- Ash Moths swarm (Residue precipitation attracts them)

### Pattern Residue Ecology

**The Cycle**:

1. Death releases Residue
2. Residue disperses into environment
3. Most organisms avoid, some process
4. Ash Moths, Residue Beetles concentrate it
5. Precipitation during cold seasons removes from atmosphere
6. Concentrated deposits form over time
7. Human harvesting or natural processing eventually cycles it

**The Imbalance**:

- Humans harvest Residue and burn it (removes it from ecosystem)
- This should warm the world over time
- But population death produces more Residue
- Current equilibrium maintained by death rate matching harvest rate
- If population grew without increased death, world might warm
- If death rate spiked without harvest, world would cool further

## Dangerous Organisms

### Predators

*Pack Runners* (*Falkafutók*)

- Wolf-equivalent that hunts in packs of 10-30
- Coordinate attacks with disturbing intelligence
- Primarily prey on elk, will attack humans
- Avoid settlements but waylay travelers

*Ice Stalkers* (*Jégkúszó*)

- Ambush predator in polar transition zones
- White/grey coloration, nearly invisible on ice
- Attacks from concealment
- Primarily a threat to expeditions

### Venomous/Toxic

*Frost Vipers* (*Fagyoskígyó*)

- Cold-blooded snake that evolved antifreeze blood
- Venom causes rapid hypothermia
- Bites are often fatal without treatment
- Found under snow, in burrows, anywhere dark

*Bitter Toads* (*Keserűvarangy*)

- Amphibian with toxic skin secretions
- Causes severe illness if handled or eaten improperly
- Some cultures prepare them as delicacy (carefully)
- Toxin used in alchemy

### Disease Vectors

*Blood Gnats* (*Vérszúnyog*)

- Small biting insect
- Emerges during Olvadás and Láng
- Carries various blood-borne diseases
- Flesh Shapers particularly vulnerable (blood smell attracts them)

*Spore Flies* (*Spóralégy*)

- Carries fungal spores (some harmful)
- Can transmit colony infection (rarely)
- Killed on sight near settlements
- More common in Middle Waters

### Köd Phenomena

During the fifth season, some animals exhibit disturbing behaviors:

*Elsewhere-Touched*:

- Animals near the bleed zones may be influenced
- Erratic behavior, ignoring normal instincts
- Some become aggressive without provocation
- Some become docile, staring at nothing
- Physical changes reported (extra eyes, wrong number of limbs)
- Usually die shortly after Köd ends
- Bodies avoided—contamination risk

## Human Interaction

### Hunting and Fishing

**Subsistence**:

- Fishing is primary protein source in coastal regions
- Hunting supplements agriculture everywhere
- Fur trade economically important
- Whale-equivalent hunting for oil and materials

**Commercial**:

- Iron Elk ranching in temperate regions
- Fish processing facilities in Shattered Reaches
- Fur trading companies in Far Shelf
- Residue creature harvesting (specialized industry)

### Agriculture

**Challenges**:

- Short growing season (Láng + parts of Olvadás/Hanyatlás)
- Cold-resistant crops only
- Heavy labor to prepare frozen ground
- Residue-burning for greenhouse heat

**Crops**:

- Root vegetables (cold-resistant)
- Hardy grains (low yield, essential)
- Fungi cultivation (indoor, reliable)
- Greenhouse crops (luxury, expensive)

**Middle Waters Advantage**:

- Longest growing season
- Most diverse crops
- Food exporter to other regions
- Agricultural wealth drives political importance

### Conservation vs. Exploitation

**Tensions**:

- Some species hunted toward scarcity
- Residue creatures particularly pressured (economic value)
- Colony zones expanding (ecosystem disruption)
- Climate management affects habitat

**Management Attempts**:

- Hunting seasons in some regions
- Protected zones (rarely enforced)
- Domestication programs for threatened species
- Colony zone containment (mixed success)
