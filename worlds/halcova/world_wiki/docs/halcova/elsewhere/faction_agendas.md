# The Elsewhere Factions: Concrete Agendas

## Overview

The five Elsewhere factions have been described in abstract terms. This document commits to specific, concrete goals and plans for each faction—what they want from Hálcova and what they're doing to get it.

## The Accountants

### Abstract Nature
Order, balance, debt, obligation. They experience reality as a ledger that must balance.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: The Great Settling**

The Accountants believe that existence itself has a debt structure. Every being that exists has incurred a debt simply by existing—a debt owed to the substrate of reality that allows them to be.

On Hálcova specifically, they want:
- **Pattern-debt collection**: Every pattern represents borrowed order. When patterns end (death), the debt should be collected—not by burning Residue for warmth, but by returning the pattern-energy to the cosmic balance
- **The Attendance's debt**: The Builders transformed themselves using borrowed reality-structure. This debt has compounded for 50,000 years. The Accountants want payment.
- **The Loom as collection mechanism**: The Loom already tracks patterns. The Accountants want to convert it into a debt-collection system.

**Specific Plans:**

1. **Cultivate debtors**: Through pacts, they create individuals who owe them directly. Each pact adds to their claim on Hálcova's pattern-substrate.

2. **Undermine Residue-burning**: Every time Residue is burned for warmth instead of returned to balance, the cosmic debt grows. They subtly encourage practices that waste Residue or prevent its use.

3. **Recruit Loom-Keepers**: Senior Accountant-touched Keepers are repositioned within the Concordat to eventually turn the Loom toward "proper accounting."

4. **Wait for the prison to fail**: When the Dissenter escapes and conflicts with the Attendance, the resulting chaos will create an opening to restructure Hálcova's pattern-economy.

**Timeline**: The Accountants think in millennia. They're patient. But they've noticed the prison degrading and are preparing to act within the next few centuries.

**Current Operations:**
- 3-5 senior Loom-Keepers are Accountant-aligned (unknowingly serving their agenda)
- A merchant guild in the Reaches has been converted into a debt-cult
- They've been carefully documenting the Attendance's "debts" for eventual collection
