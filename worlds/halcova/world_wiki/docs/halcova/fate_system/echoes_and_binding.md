## Echoes

Echoes are the bound remnants of the dead, anchored to the living world through objects (anchors) and maintained with Residue. They serve as labor, advisors, or tools, but their existence is precarious: echoes degrade, lose memories, and may awaken, regaining fragments of their former selves.

### Bleed

**Story Reference:**
Bleed is the central phenomenon in "Bleed" (02_bleed_story_v2.md), where the protagonist's memories and identity are threatened by the echo's influence.

**Implications in the Stories:**
- Bleed is both a danger and a source of power. It blurs the line between self and other, living and dead, and is a metaphor for trauma and forbidden knowledge.

Bleed is the phenomenon where memories, habits, or even personality traits of an echo begin to transfer to the living binder. This is both a risk and a source of forbidden knowledge.

### Dissolution

**Story Reference:**
Dissolution is dramatized in "The Warden" (04_the_warden_story_v2.md), where Wardens must enforce the destruction of unstable echoes, and in "Bleed," where dissolution is both a threat and a release.

**Implications in the Stories:**
- Dissolution is not just a technical process but a moral and emotional crisis. It raises questions about the rights of echoes and the responsibilities of the living.

Echoes that awaken or become unstable are subject to dissolution—a process that unravels their pattern, often violently. Wardens are responsible for enforcing dissolution protocols.

## The Economics of Death

**Story Reference:**
The economics of echo binding are explored in "Bleed" (the cost of Residue and echo labor), "The Constrained" (echoes as social capital), and "The Warden" (regulation and enforcement).

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The stories show how access to echoes and Residue is a form of privilege, and how the regulation of death labor reinforces social hierarchies.

Binding echoes is a regulated profession, with strict controls on the number and type of echoes a person may carry. Residue, the substance required to maintain echoes, is expensive and tightly rationed.

## Rituals

- **Binding**: The act of anchoring an echo to an object.
- **Release**: The act of letting an echo go, either voluntarily or by force.
- **Dissolution**: The destruction of an echo's pattern.
