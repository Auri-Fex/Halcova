# The Pattern Caste System

---
**Story Reference:**
This section is informed by "The Reading" (01_the_reading_story_v3.md), "The Constrained" (03_the_constrained_story_v2.md), and "The Warden" (04_the_warden_story_v2.md). The lived experience of caste, the mechanisms of enforcement, and the possibility of subversion are dramatized through Fèinnav, Àrnnav, and Vèscalìn.

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The stories show how caste is both a metaphysical and social reality, shaping every aspect of life from birth to death.
- Attempts to subvert or escape caste boundaries are met with both bureaucratic and existential consequences.
- The system’s rigidity is a source of both suffering and resistance, as seen in the arcs of the main characters.

## Overview

Halcova’s society is structured around the pattern system, which sorts individuals into castes based on their Binding. This system is both metaphysical and social, with patterns determining not only fate but also legal status, occupation, and marriage prospects.

## Castes

**Story Reference:**
The division between privileged and constrained is central to "The Reading" (Fèinnav and Àrnnav), "The Constrained" (Àrnnav’s struggle), and "The Warden" (Vèscalìn’s investigation).

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The stories illustrate how caste is enforced not just by law, but by custom, geography, and even language.

- **Pattern-Privileged**: Merchants, minor nobility, and those with favorable patterns.
- **Pattern-Constrained**: Workers, Hand Quarter residents, and those with difficult or unlucky patterns.
- **Pattern-Pending/Outcast**: Those awaiting Binding or who have rejected the system.

## Social Mobility

**Story Reference:**
Social mobility (or its lack) is dramatized in "The Reading" (pattern purchase), "The Constrained" (Àrnnav’s lack of options), and "The Warden" (exposure of fraud).

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The stories show that while the system claims to reward merit, it is in fact designed to perpetuate privilege and constrain the majority.

While the system claims to reward merit, in practice, wealth and influence can purchase better patterns, perpetuating inequality. The Hand Quarter is home to the most constrained, while Merchant City and Temple Hill house the privileged.
