# Hálcova World Summary

## Overview

**Hálcova** (HAHL-ko-vah) — "The Death-Between" — is a dark fantasy ice world orbiting an orange dwarf star. Every person carries a **Sórscad**, a five-part fate pattern that determines who they are and what they'll become. Something answers when this pattern is read. That something may be divine, may be Elsewhere, may be both. Nobody knows for certain.

The world runs on death. **Pattern Residue** — the energy released when fates dissolve — fuels magic, industry, and civilization itself. It also absorbs heat, making the world cold. Peace is expensive. War is productive. Some people are worth more dead than alive, and everyone knows the math.

40,000-50,000 years ago, Hálcova was warmer. Something changed it. Ancient structures at both poles hint at deliberate engineering. The five moons orbit in suspiciously perfect resonance. Whoever built the world's systems is gone, but their work persists.

## Thematic Story Spine

**Axis 1 — Inheritance vs Prophecy**: *"Your pattern is what you were born with. Your reading is what they say you'll become. Sometimes these are the same. Sometimes they can be purchased."*

Inheritance and prophecy collapse in Hálcova. Natal circles are read at birth (inheritance). Binding circles are drawn at ceremony (prophecy). But wealthy families purchase favorable draws. The system presents prophecy as neutral reading of fate—the truth: prophecy reads a world already shaped by inheritance.

**Axis 2 — Trade of Fate**: *"Some lives are worth more dead than alive. Everyone knows the math."*

Fate is commodity. Pattern Residue fuels civilization. Fate futures trade on prediction accuracy. Souls are substitutes in pacts. The Loom's predictions are accurate partly because institutions act on them—creating the conditions for prophecy to succeed.

**Central Question**: If prophecy is tradeable, who profits? If fate can be bought, what's the price—and who pays it?

See `world/thematic_core.md` for complete thematic architecture.

## The Metaphysical Spine

Hálcova isn't a world with an economy—it **is** an economy. Economic and psychological principles are the literal physics of reality here.

### Economic Principles as Reality

| Principle | Primary Expression | Horror |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Opportunity Cost | Fate Threading | Spending your own possibilities |
| Sunk Cost Fallacy | Core Binding | Can't let go of the dead |
| Moral Hazard | Pact Summoning | Others pay your price |
| Asymmetric Information | The Loom | They know you better than you |
| Principal-Agent Problem | Warden Order | Enforcers serve themselves |
| Externalities | Residue Economy | Death's costs are socialized |
| Hyperbolic Discounting | Colony Hosting | The colony waits |
| Prisoner's Dilemma | Substitution Market | Coordination failure as harvest |
| Tragedy of Commons | Residue Harvesting | Importing death from elsewhere |
| Mechanism Design | The Loom's Origin | Someone built this trap |

### Psychological Principles as Reality

| Principle | Primary Expression | Horror |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Cognitive Dissonance | Warden Attunement | Believing because you sacrificed |
| Prospect Theory | Pattern Gambling | Predictions create reference points |
| Attribution Error | Pattern Essentialism | Character vs. circumstance |

### Philosophical Tensions

- **Determinism vs. Free Will**: The Loom predicts choices. Does prediction remove choice?
- **Ship of Theseus**: Magic transforms identity. At what point are you no longer you?
- **Experience Machine**: The Elsewhere offers unlimited sensation. Why not accept?

## Planetary Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Star** | Sárgvas (K-type orange dwarf) |
| **Day Length** | 36 hours |
| **Year Length** | 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) |
| **Seasons** | Csend (76d), Olvadás (76d), Láng (77d), Hanyatlás (76d), Köd (45-46d) |
| **Moons** | 5 (Lélek, Hús, Kötel, Vég, Fonál) |
| **Temperature Range** | -70°C (polar) to +28°C (Middle Waters) |
| **Axial Tilt** | ~20° |
| **Orbital Eccentricity** | ~0.15 |

### The Star and Sky

Sárgvas casts amber-gold light. The sky is teal-tinged blue. Sunsets linger in deep amber and blood red. Vegetation evolved dark to absorb available light—black polar, purple-red temperate, red-orange tropical. Auroras are extreme and correlate with Pattern Residue concentration.

### The Five Moons

Each moon corresponds to a Sórscad circle and a magical practice. The orbital resonances are too perfect to be natural—someone arranged them.

| Moon | Association | Character |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Lélek | Soul/Core Binding | Largest, pale gold |
| Hús | Flesh/Flesh Shaping | Medium, reddish |
| Kötel | Binding/Pact Summoning | Medium, dim grey |
| Vég | Death/Colony Summoning | Small, bright white |
| Fonál | Fate/Fate Threading | Smallest, distant |

### The Five Seasons

1. **Csend** (Silence): Deep winter, 76 days. Death, endurance, debt settlement.
2. **Olvadás** (Thaw): Dangerous transition, 76 days. Disease, opportunity.
3. **Láng** (Flame): High summer, 77 days. Conflict, harvest, fate's height.
4. **Hanyatlás** (Decline): Urgent preparation, 76 days. Last chances.
5. **Köd** (Veil): Strange season, 45-46 days. Elsewhere bleed at the poles.

## Geography

### The Five Regions

| Region | Character | Pattern Role | Governance |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Heartlands** | Orthodox center, Great Loom Node | Central (certification required) | Theocratic monarchy |
| **Shattered Reaches** | Fragmented, maritime, trading | Marginal (officially) | City-states + Leagues |
| **Middle Waters** | Warm archipelago, contested | Varies by controller | Colonial patchwork |
| **Vent Lands** | Volcanic, heat-independent | Secondary to expertise | Guild federation |
| **Far Shelf** | Frontier, heterodox | Rejected | Decentralized autonomy |

### Polar Mysteries

**Northern Cap**: The Wound—where Elsewhere connects to Hálcova. Köd bleed is leakage.

**Southern Cap**: The Prison—something is contained here. Structures designed to hold.

---

## The Magic System

### The Five Arts

| Art | Cost | Horror |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Core Binding** | Pattern Residue, self-erosion | Echoes don't know they're dead |
| **Flesh Shaping** | Blood, physical degradation | You stop caring whose blood |
| **Pact Summoning** | Your soul (or substitutes) | The entity is honest about eating you |
| **Fate Threading** | Your future possibilities | Eating your own potential |
| **Colony Summoning** | Biomass, identity | Partnership becomes absorption |

### Additional Systems

- **Behavioral Alchemy**: Applied economics as manipulation
- **Residue Engineering**: Processing death-energy into useful forms
- **Pattern Interference**: Manipulating fate directly (possibly mythical)
- **Echo Architecture**: Networks of bound dead
- **Colony Engineering**: Shaping fungi for purpose
- **Prediction Markets**: Trading on future outcomes

---

## The Fate System

### The Sórscad

Five-circle metaphysical pattern everyone carries:

| Circle | Domain | Associated Moon |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Léilcrù | Soul/Core | Lélek |
| Húslaimh | Flesh/Body | Hús |
| Cóitcai | Binding/Connection | Kötel |
| Hálmaht | Death/End | Vég |
| Sórscad | Fate/Path | Fonál |

**Thematic Note (Inheritance vs Prophecy)**: Natal circles (Léilcrù, Húslaimh, Hálmaht) are read at birth—inheritance. Binding circles (Cóitcai, Sórscad) are drawn at ceremony—prophecy. But wealthy families purchase favorable draws, collapsing the distinction.

### The Loom

Distributed network that reads, records, and predicts fate. Something called "The Attendance" answers queries. May be divine, may be Elsewhere, may be both. Predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance—the uncertainty is whether it's reading or creating fate.

**Thematic Note (Trade of Fate)**: The Loom's predictions are tradeable. Fate futures, pattern speculation, and prediction markets all depend on Loom accuracy. The system monetizes destiny.

---

## Governance and Law

### Political Philosophy Problems

In a fate-real world:

- What does **equality** mean when patterns predict different worth?
- What does **justice** mean when actions were predicted?
- What does **consent** mean when choice may be illusory?
- What **legitimizes authority** when the Loom could identify "leadership patterns"?


### Regional Approaches

| Region | Legitimacy Basis | Pattern in Law | Warden Status |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Heartlands | Divine pattern-mandate | Crime to deviate | Full authority |
| Shattered Reaches | Consent and contract | Officially excluded | Treaty-limited |
| Middle Waters | Power projection | Varies | Colonial presence |
| Vent Lands | Expertise and necessity | Secondary | Guild-negotiated |
| Far Shelf | Community autonomy | Rejected | Illegal |

### Legal Tensions

- **Pattern evidence**: Admissible? Dispositive?
- **Pre-crime intervention**: Can you punish predicted-but-uncommitted crimes?
- **Pattern-weighted sentencing**: Should predicted recidivists serve longer?
- **Residue from executions**: The justice system produces fuel

---

## Society

### Religion

All traditions accept the Loom's accuracy. They disagree about why it works:

- **Orthodoxy**: The Weaver assigns patterns with divine purpose
- **Threadists**: Fate is still being created; choices participate
- **Hollow Saints**: Fate is a prison; selling your soul is liberation
- **Fleshwrights**: Fate is biology; transcend the meat
- **Colony Cults**: Individual patterns are fragments of an original whole
- **Ancestor Speakers**: The dead advise; binding is dialogue

### Economics

**Thematic Expression (Trade of Fate)**: Pattern as capital, fate as commodity, death as production.

- Credit, employment, insurance priced by Sórscad
- Pattern Residue harvested, refined, traded
- War and plague are economically productive
- Class: Pattern-Privileged, Pattern-Constrained, Pattern-Illegible

**Thematic Expression (Inheritance vs Prophecy)**: Pattern-privileged inherit access; the Loom then "predicts" their success. Pattern-constrained inherit obstacles; the Loom predicts their failure. Prophecy reads a world shaped by inheritance.

### The Warden Order

Enforcement arm of Loom orthodoxy. Attuned to the Loom through a process that resembles a pact. Hunt deviation, manipulation, evasion. Full authority in Heartlands; contested elsewhere.

---

## Ecology

- **Flora**: Black (polar) → purple-red (temperate) → red-orange (tropical)
- **Fauna**: Cold-adapted, mostly Residue-avoiding, some specialized feeders
- **Colony organisms**: Unique Residue relationship, basis for hosting magic

---

## Historical Mystery

40,000-50,000 years ago, Hálcova was warmer. Pattern Residue began accumulating. The poles froze. Ancient structures at both poles may have caused or been built to manage the change. The builders disappeared. The moons may have been arranged at this time.

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pattern-Privileged** | Individuals whose Sórscad patterns predict favorable outcomes (success, health, longevity, social advancement). They receive lower interest rates, better employment opportunities, favorable legal treatment, and social respect. The system validates their privilege by creating the conditions for predicted success. |
| **Pattern-Constrained** | Individuals whose Sórscad patterns predict unfavorable outcomes (poverty, crime, early death, social marginalization). They face higher interest rates, limited employment, hostile legal treatment, and social stigma. The system constrains them by creating the conditions for predicted failure. |
| **Pattern-Illegible** | Practitioners whose patterns have been contaminated, faded, or transformed by magical practice—making Loom predictions unreliable. Includes heavy Core Binders (layered patterns), Flesh Shapers (hollowed Húslaimh), Pact Summoners (faded Léilcrú), Fate Threaders (narrowed Sórscad), and Colony Hosts (hybrid patterns). |
| **Pattern Residue** | The energy released when pattern-bearing creatures die. Absorbs thermal energy during formation (more than it releases when burned), creating Hálcova's net-negative heat economy. Used as fuel for heating, magic, and industry. |
| **Spent Residue / Residue Ash** | Pattern Residue that has been burned and is now thermodynamically inert. Contains no recoverable energy. Accumulates as waste product of civilization. |
| **The Attendance** | Whatever answers when Loom-Keepers and Wardens perform their rituals. May be divine (The Weaver), may be Elsewhere entities (possibly Accountants), may be something else entirely. The uncertainty is load-bearing. |
| **Deviation** | Acting against your pattern's predictions. Criminalized in the Heartlands, tolerated elsewhere. Evidence that either the Loom is imperfect or free will exists—neither interpretation is comfortable for orthodoxy. |

## Normalized Entertainment in Hálcova

### Theater Traditions

**The Core Question:** What makes Hálcovan theater distinctive beyond "medieval theater with pattern themes"?

**Proposal: The Echo Theater Tradition**

The most distinctive Hálcovan theatrical form involves bound echoes performing alongside living actors. This creates something impossible elsewhere:

**Echo Drama (Visszhangszínház):**

- Bound echoes of deceased performers continue their roles
- A production might have echoes from different eras performing together
- The echo of a famous actor from 100 years ago plays opposite a living newcomer
- Some roles are "owned" by specific echoes across generations
- Creates eerie, powerful performances mixing life and death

**Implications:**

- Wealthy theater companies maintain echo collections
- Debates about whether echoes "really" perform or just repeat
- Some echoes have performed the same role for centuries
- Living actors compete with/learn from dead masters
- The death of a great performer means potential binding (family negotiation)

**Theater Types:**

**Liturgical Drama (Egyházi Színház):**
- Church-controlled, religious content
- Pattern-moral tales, saints' lives, Weaver mythology
- Performed at festivals, in church spaces
- Free admission (propaganda function)
- Some echoes of holy figures (controversial—is it really them?)

**Court Theater (Udvari Színház):**
- Noble entertainment
- Historical dramas, royal celebrations
- Elaborate production values
- Echo collections as status symbols
- Political messaging (subtle or not)

**Popular Theater (Népi Színház):**
- Commercial entertainment
- Mix of comedy, drama, spectacle
- No echo performers (too expensive)
- Traveling troupes between cities
- Sometimes subversive (coded criticism)

**Underground Theater (Föld Alatti Színház):**
- Illegal or semi-legal performances
- Threadist themes, pattern-criticism
- Hidden venues, word-of-mouth audiences
- Performers risk arrest
- No echoes (would require Church licensing)

**Distinctive Performance Elements:**

**The Five-Act Structure:**
- Traditional plays have five acts (one per circle)
- Each act emphasizes different fate-aspect
	- Léilcrù act: Character establishment, soul-exploration
	- Húslaimh act: Physical conflict, bodily stakes
	- Cöthrá act: Relationships, bonds tested
	- Vénia act: Death approaches, mortality confronted
	- Fonárich act: Resolution, fate fulfilled or defied

**Pattern-Masks:**
- Performers wear masks indicating character's pattern-type
- Audience reads character fate from mask before action confirms it
- Tragic irony when audience knows doom character doesn't
- Comedic inversion when "death-marked" character survives

**The Living/Dead Dialogue:**
- Scenes where echo performers interact with living
- Represents communion with ancestors
- Technical challenge (echoes have limitations)
- Powerful emotional effect when done well

---

### Games of Chance and Skill

**Proposal: A Gambling Ecosystem**

Beyond Fonálháló (the strategy board game), Hálcova needs a range of gambling entertainments reflecting different classes, contexts, and pattern-relationships.

**Card Games:**

**Öt Kör (Five Circles):**
- The most popular card game
- Deck of 50 cards (10 per circle, values 1-10)
- Multiple game variants using same deck
- Pattern-reading can predict draws (creates advantage dynamics)
- Played everywhere from palace to gutter

**Game Variants:**
- Mintázás (Patterning): Collect sets, form patterns, predict opponent hands
- Haláltánc (Death Dance): Elimination game, last player standing
- Szövés (Weaving): Cooperative variant, build shared pattern together
- Vakminta (Blind Pattern): Hidden information, deduction focus

**Kereskedő (Merchant):**
- Reaches-origin trading game
- Cards represent goods, contracts, ships
- Economic simulation through cards
- Less pattern-themed, more commercial
- Popular in eastern provinces, Reaches trade communities

**Dice Games:**

**Sorsvetés (Fate-Cast):**
- Five special dice (one per circle)
- Each die has different symbols
- Combinations have meanings (like poker hands but fate-themed)
- Fast gambling, tavern standard
- Pattern-readers claim to influence rolls (probably false, but believed)

**Halálkocka (Death Dice):**
- Single die, highest stakes
- Simple: each player rolls, lowest roller eliminated (literally or financially)
- Underground game, sometimes actually lethal
- Banned but persistent

**Gambling Establishments:**

**Fogadóház (Betting House):**
- Licensed establishments for legal gambling
- Fonálháló tables, card rooms, dice areas
- Class-stratified (separate rooms for different stations)
- Church takes percentage (gambling tithe)
- Pattern-readers available for consultation (fee)

**Árnyékfogadó (Shadow Betting):**
- Illegal gambling dens
- Higher stakes, no Church cut
- Mixed-class clientele (anonymity valued)
- Warden raids regular but not effective
- Connected to gray market generally

**Pattern-Prediction Gambling:**

The unique Hálcovan gambling form: betting on or against pattern predictions.

**How It Works:**
- Licensed reader makes prediction about person/event
- Bets placed on whether prediction will prove true
- If you bet against prediction and win, payout is higher
- Creates incentive structure around "beating fate"
- Popular for: births (pattern-prediction of child), marriages (compatibility), businesses (success/failure)

**The Dark Side:**
- Incentive to make predictions fail
- Murder to win bets on death-predictions
- Manipulation of circumstances
- Warden investigation of suspicious "fate-beating"

---

### Fairs and Carnivals

**Proposal: The Festival Circuit**

Hálcova's calendar creates natural festival moments. Each becomes opportunity for carnival entertainment.

**Major Festival Types:**
- Seasonal Festivals:
	- Fagyünnep (Winter start)
	- Olvadásünnep (Spring survival)
	- Fénynap (Midsummer)
	- Aratásünnep (Harvest)
	- Fátyolnyitás/zárás (Fávarzach transitions)
- Religious Festivals:
	- Halottak Napja (Day of the Dead, midwinter)
	- Saints' days throughout year
	- Pattern-confirmation ceremonies (community celebrations)
- Market Fairs:
	- Trade-focused gatherings
	- Entertainment accompanies commerce
	- Seasonal scheduling

**Carnival Entertainment Elements:**

**The Pattern-Carnival (Mintakarnevál):**
- Unique Hálcovan tradition
- During carnival, pattern-rules relax
- Masks hide identity (and pattern-marks)
- Social mixing otherwise forbidden
- Pattern-constrained can pretend to be privileged
- Licensed chaos (controlled release of tension)
- Church officially disapproves; practically tolerates

**Traveling Performers:**
- Acrobats, jugglers, strong-performers
- Animal acts (trained Hórvam, exotic creatures)
- Musicians, dancers
- Fortune-tellers (unlicensed pattern-readers—illegal but tolerated at fairs)
- Freak shows (pattern-anomalies displayed—ethically horrifying, culturally common)

**Food and Drink:**
- Festival-specific foods
- Temporary taverns and food stalls
- Regional specialties available
- Competitive eating (connects to Méregkóstoló tradition?)
- Public drunkenness tolerated

**Games and Contests:**
- Strength competitions (lifting, throwing)
- Speed contests (foot races, Hórvam races)
- Skill games (archery, knife-throwing)
- Gambling booths (dice, cards, wheel-spinning)
- Prizes: coin, goods, sometimes thread-marks (valuable)

**The Spectacle Elements:**
- Public executions (Corrections) often timed to festivals
- Mintaharc exhibition matches
- Military parades
- Church processions
- Noble displays (wealth, power, patronage)

**Distinctive Carnival Traditions:**

**Maszkjáték (Mask-Play):**
- The pattern-hiding tradition
- Elaborate masks sold and rented
- Identity-play as entertainment
- Some masks represent circle-types
- Others represent social roles (King for a Day, etc.)
- Sexual/romantic connections across pattern-lines (scandal if exposed)

**Halottak Tánca (Dance of the Dead):**
- Midwinter tradition
- Living dance with echo-projections
- Honors ancestors, processes grief
- Eerie and beautiful
- Church-sanctioned death-positivity

**Fátyol Vigasság (Veil Revelry):**
- Fávarzach-transition celebrations
- Embracing uncertainty as the veil thins
- Wilder than other festivals (Elsewhere influence blamed)
- Strange occurrences accepted/celebrated
- Foreigners find it disturbing

**Regional Fair Variations:**

**Heartlands Fairs:**
- Most religious framework
- Pattern-themes prominent
- Church oversight
- Corrections as entertainment
- Controlled wildness

**Reaches Fairs:**
- Commercial focus
- Less pattern-obsession
- Contract-signing celebrations
- Maritime games
- More actual freedom

**Vent Lands Fairs:**
- Guild-sponsored
- Industrial demonstrations
- Flesh Shaping displays
- Colony exhibitions (disturbing to outsiders)
- Technical competitions

---

### Pattern-Reading Demonstrations

**Proposal: Reading as Entertainment**

Pattern-reading isn't just bureaucratic process—it's also public spectacle.

**Public Reading Events:**

**The Festival Reading:**
- Major festivals include public readings
- Prominent citizens' patterns read before crowds
- Newborns' first readings (Pattern-Naming)
- Coming-of-age readings (Pattern-Confirmation)
- Marriage compatibility readings
- Entertainment value: anticipation, revelation, reaction

**The Demonstration Reading:**
- Licensed readers show their skill
- Volunteers from audience
- Readings interpreted dramatically
- Educational purpose (teaching pattern-types)
- Some theatrical embellishment (readers as performers)

**The Competition Reading:**
- Multiple readers interpret same subject
- Judged on accuracy, detail, eloquence
- University and Church competitions
- Prestige for winners
- Identifies talented readers for advancement

**The Voyeuristic Appeal:**
- Learning others' fates (gossip elevated)
- Comparing to own pattern
- Schadenfreude when constrained patterns revealed
- Hope when good patterns revealed
- The drama of revelation

**Ethical Complications:**

**Consent Questions:**
- Public readings require consent (theoretically)
- Social pressure makes refusal difficult
- Children can't consent (parents decide)
- Prisoners/condemned read publicly without consent

**Privacy Violations:**
- Skilled readers reveal more than requested
- Information asymmetry exploitation
- Blackmail potential
- Warden surveillance disguised as entertainment

**Performance vs. Truth:**
- Readers embellish for entertainment
- Some readings are partially fabricated
- Audience can't verify
- Creates cynicism about all readings

**The Underground Alternative:**

**Unlicensed Readers:**
- Fair fortune-tellers
- Back-room consultations
- Claim to read "true" pattern without Church filter
- Some genuine skill; some fraud
- Illegal but pervasive

**Threadist Readings:**
- Alternative interpretation framework
- Emphasize possibility over destiny
- "Your pattern shows potential, not prison"
- Rare, secret, valuable to those seeking hope
