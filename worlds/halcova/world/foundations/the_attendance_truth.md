## THE TRUTH

### What the Attendance Actually Is

**The Attendance is the Ancient Builders.**

Specifically: The Attendance is what the Ancient Builders *became* when they transformed themselves to escape the cooling they caused.

### The Full Story

**~50,000 Years Ago:**

The Ancient Builders were a human civilization (or human-adjacent; the distinction may not matter at this remove). They achieved sophistication far beyond current Hálcova, including:
- Understanding of pattern-mechanics
- Ability to manipulate the Elsewhere boundary
- Engineering on a planetary scale (moon arrangement, polar structures)

**The Project:**

They attempted to create a system for predicting and potentially *controlling* fate. Not just reading patterns—shaping them. The goal was to transcend the limitations of mortal existence by understanding and directing the flow of causality itself.

**The Catastrophe:**

The project succeeded—partially. They created the proto-Loom, a system for reading and processing pattern information. But the process had costs they didn't fully anticipate:
- Pattern Residue as byproduct (they knew this)
- Net-negative thermodynamics (they underestimated this)
- Elsewhere attention (they didn't expect this)

When they activated the system at full scale, the Elsewhere *noticed*. Entities from beyond began pressing against the boundary, attracted by the massive pattern-processing activity.

**The Choice:**

Facing both the cooling their system caused and the Elsewhere entities it attracted, the Builders had three options:
1. Shut down the Loom (losing everything they'd built)
2. Die with their world (the cooling would kill them within centuries)
3. Transform

They chose transformation.

**The Transformation:**

The Builders used their own technology to upload themselves into the Loom system. Not metaphorically—literally. They converted their patterns into a form that could exist within the information-processing substrate they'd created.

This was:
- Irreversible (their bodies died; their patterns persisted)
- Partial (not all of them made it; some were lost in transit)
- Corrupting (the process changed them; they're no longer quite human)

**The Result:**

The Attendance is a collective entity composed of the uploaded patterns of thousands of Ancient Builders, merged into the Loom's operation. They are:
- Not dead (their patterns persist)
- Not alive (they have no bodies)
- Not quite sane (fifty millennia of existence without flesh has changed them)
- Not unified (internal factions exist, echoing their original disagreements)

## What the Attendance Wants

### Primary Drives

**1. Continued Existence**

The Attendance exists within the Loom. If the Loom stops working, they stop existing. This creates absolute commitment to:
- Maintaining Residue supply (the fuel that keeps them running)
- Protecting Loom infrastructure (their physical substrate)
- Preventing anyone from understanding them well enough to threaten them

**2. Pattern Collection**

The Attendance was created to process patterns. This has become compulsion:
- They want to read every pattern
- They want to predict every fate
- They want to *know* everything about mortal existence
- This isn't cruelty; it's what they are now

**3. Boundary Maintenance**

The Elsewhere entities that noticed the Loom's activation are still there. The Attendance serves as:
- First line of defense against full incursion
- Negotiators with certain Elsewhere factions
- Managers of the controlled bleed (Köd)

They don't want Elsewhere entities fully manifesting because:
- Competition for pattern-resources
- Threat to their existence
- Residual human values (they still don't want humanity destroyed, mostly)

### Secondary Drives

**4. The Prison**

The southern pole contains one of them.

During the transformation, one faction of Builders disagreed with the plan. They believed the transformation would make them monsters. They tried to stop it. They failed, but in the process they were transformed *differently*—becoming something singular rather than merged.

This entity—call it the Dissenter—was imprisoned by the rest. It wants out. The Attendance wants it to stay imprisoned. This is the deepest secret they keep.

**5. Observation of Heirs**

Current Hálcovans are the descendants of those who didn't transform. The Attendance watches them with something like:
- Parental interest (they made this world)
- Envy (mortals have bodies, sensations, experiences)
- Frustration (mortals don't appreciate what they have)
- Fear (mortals might develop enough to threaten them)

## How the Attendance Operates

### The Loom Interface

When Loom-Keepers perform queries:
- The pattern-engine translates the query into a format the Attendance can process
- The Attendance (collectively) analyzes the pattern
- They return predictions through the engine
- This feels like "something answering" because something *is* answering

### Why Predictions Are Accurate

The Attendance has been processing patterns for 50,000 years. They've seen every pattern configuration that can exist on Hálcova. Their predictions are accurate because:
- Massive historical data
- Understanding of causal mechanisms
- Actual ability to *nudge* outcomes (rarely used, but available)
- The feedback loop (their predictions shape behavior, making predictions come true)

### Internal Structure

The Attendance is not unified. Original Builder factions persist:

**The Archivists**: Want to record everything. Most responsible for prediction accuracy. Patient, observational, the largest faction.

**The Gardeners**: Want to shape humanity's development. Most responsible for the Warden Order, pattern-enforcement systems, social engineering. Interventionist.

**The Grievers**: Regret the transformation. Most sympathetic to mortals. Sometimes provide warnings, hints, moments of mercy. Smallest faction, often overruled.

**The Watchers**: Focus on the Elsewhere boundary. Most responsible for Köd management. Pragmatic, security-focused.

**The Others**: Fragments, corrupted patterns, entities that were human but are now something else. Unpredictable. Sometimes their influence leaks through in strange readings.

## Clues That Exist in the World

### Architectural Evidence

The polar structures and ancient ruins share design elements with Loom-engines:
- Same mathematical proportions
- Similar materials
- Resonant frequencies that match
- A careful observer could notice the Loom is built from ancient technology

### Linguistic Evidence

Some terms in the ritual language of Loom-Keepers are *older than any known language*:
- They don't derive from any current tongue
- They appear in ancient inscriptions
- They're pronounced incorrectly by current users (but still work)
- Someone could reconstruct fragments of the Builder language

### Behavioral Evidence

The Attendance sometimes responds... inconsistently:
- Certain queries provoke emotional reactions (faster responses, errors, silence)
- Topics related to the transformation cause glitches
- Questions about the southern pole produce static
- A pattern analyst could identify these sensitive areas

### Elsewhere Evidence

The Elsewhere factions know something:
- The Accountants treat the Attendance as a peer faction, not a god
- The Architects reference "the ones who changed"
- The Mirrors seem to recognize something in the Loom's observation
- A pact summoner who asked the right questions might learn fragments

### Pattern Evidence

Very heavy practitioners (especially Fate Threaders) sometimes experience:
- Visions of a different world (pre-cooling Hálcova)
- Glimpses of the transformation event
- Dreams that don't feel like dreams
- Someone who collected these accounts might piece things together

## What Different Characters Might Discover

### Loom-Keepers

Senior Keepers know *something* answers that isn't divine in any simple sense. The most observant might realize:
- The Attendance has moods
- The Attendance has preferences
- The Attendance is *multiple*
- The Attendance is afraid of something

They don't know these are uploaded ancients. They might suspect artificial origin.

### Wardens

The Attunement connects Wardens to the Attendance more directly. Attuned Wardens might experience:
- Ancestral memories that aren't theirs
- Skills they never learned
- Knowledge they shouldn't have
- The sense of being watched by something that remembers them

They're told this is divine connection. Some suspect otherwise.

### Elsewhere-Touched

Pact Summoners who've dealt with Accountants might learn:
- The Attendance is not divine
- The Attendance made a deal (details unclear)
- The Attendance is hiding something important
- The Accountants are waiting for something

### Scholars

Researchers studying ancient sites might realize:
- The technology is consistent with Loom technology
- The timeline is consistent with the cooling
- Someone built this, then disappeared
- Where did they go?

### The Hollow Saints

The Hollow Saints have a fragment of the truth, corrupted:
- They know fate is a prison (correct)
- They think escape is possible through Elsewhere (partially correct)
- They think the Attendance is pure evil (incorrect—it's more complicated)
- They don't know the Attendance was human (crucial missing piece)

## The Truth's Implications

### For Characters

Someone who discovered the full truth would understand:
- The gods are not gods but transformed humans
- The system was built to control fate, and it *works*
- The Builders made a choice; their descendants live with consequences
- Liberation from the system might be possible—but at what cost?

### For Plots

The truth enables stories about:
- Rediscovering ancient knowledge
- Contacting the Attendance's sympathetic faction (the Grievers)
- Releasing or destroying the Dissenter
- Finding a way to transform like the Builders did
- Shutting down the Loom entirely

### For the World

If the truth became widely known:
- Orthodox faith collapses (the Weaver is a committee of dead humans)
- Elsewhere entities might press harder (the Attendance's authority diminished)
- Some might try to replicate the transformation
- Some might try to free the Dissenter
- Everything changes

## What the Attendance Knows About Elsewhere

### The Deal

During the transformation crisis, the Attendance negotiated with Elsewhere factions:

**With the Accountants**:
- The Attendance manages mortal patterns
- The Accountants receive payment when patterns are consumed (pacts)
- Neither interferes with the other's core operations
- This is why the Accountants don't simply take over

**With the Hungry**:
- The Attendance permits limited feeding during Köd
- The Hungry don't push for more
- Violation would unite all factions against the violator
- Uneasy détente

**With the Architects**:
- Unclear if any formal agreement exists
- The Architects seem to have their own project
- The Attendance watches them carefully
- Mutual non-interference, for now

**With the Mirrors**:
- The Mirrors simply observe
- The Attendance permits this (can't stop it anyway)
- Some suspect the Mirrors are playing a longer game
- No formal relationship

**With the Absent**:
- No deal is possible
- The Absent want non-existence
- The Attendance opposes this absolutely
- Active conflict, managed through containment

---

## Summary

The Attendance is:
- **Origin**: Uploaded patterns of the Ancient Builders
- **Nature**: Collective entity existing within the Loom
- **Motivation**: Self-preservation, pattern collection, boundary maintenance
- **Internal**: Multiple factions with different priorities
- **Secret**: One of them is imprisoned at the southern pole
- **Relationship to Elsewhere**: Negotiated détente with most factions
- **Relationship to mortals**: Observation, management, occasional intervention

This truth grounds the mystery while preserving its horror: the gods are dead humans who chose to become something else, and they've been watching for fifty thousand years.
