## The Hálcovan Calendar

### Basic Parameters

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Day length | 36 hours |
| Year length | 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) |
| Seasons | 5 |
| Moons | 5 |

### The Five Seasons

| Season | Name | Duration | Character |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Csend (CHEND) - "Silence" | 76 days | Deep winter, coldest |
| 2 | Olvadás (ol-VAH-dahsh) - "Thaw" | 76 days | Spring, dangerous transition |

| 5 | Köd (KUHD) - "Veil" | 45-46 days | Strange season, Elsewhere bleed |

**Total**: 350 or 351 days depending on Long Köd cycle

### The Long Köd Cycle

The fractional day (0.667) accumulates. Every third year:
- Köd extends from 45 to 46 days
- Called a "Long Köd year"
- Sequence: Short (45d), Short (45d), Long (46d), repeat

**Cultural Significance**:
- Long Köd is considered more dangerous
- Major decisions often delayed until after Long Köd
- Additional day for Elsewhere contact/risk
- Calendar-keepers track the cycle; common people just know "some Köd seasons are longer"

### The Fourteen Months

The year is divided into **14 months** of 25 days each (350 days), with fractional day adjustments during Köd:
