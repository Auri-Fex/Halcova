# Conspiracies and the Shadow Ledger

## Pattern Fraud

Pattern fraud is the practice of altering, purchasing, or otherwise manipulating the outcome of Binding ceremonies. This is most often accomplished through bribes to Szòvòtarar, who record a purchased pattern in the Registry rather than the true result of the Attendance.

## The Shadow Ledger

A number of ledgers exist, kept by Szòvòtarar, Pattern House assistants, and certain merchant families, documenting the true patterns, the purchased patterns, and the payments made. These ledgers are dangerous: possession is grounds for dissolution or worse.

## Silencing Orders

To protect the system, those who threaten to expose pattern fraud—Pattern House assistants, echoes, or even entire families—may be silenced. This can include murder, induced illness, or forced dissolution.

## Recent Scandals

The exposure of these ledgers and the stories of those who uncovered them have begun to destabilize the pattern system, leading to calls for reform, revolution, or further suppression.
