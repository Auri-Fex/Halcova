# Metaphysical Terminology: Pattern, Core, and Soul

## The Terminology Problem

Three terms appear throughout Hálcovan documentation that seem to overlap: **pattern**, **core**, and **soul**. This document establishes their precise meanings and relationships.

## Definitive Terminology

### Pattern (Minta)

**What It Is**: The abstract metaphysical structure that defines an entity's existence.

**Technical Definition**: A pattern is the informational/energetic configuration that makes something *that particular thing* rather than any other thing. Every person, animal, and sufficiently complex entity has a pattern. The pattern includes:
- Identity information (who/what you are)
- Trajectory information (what you're likely to become)
- Connection information (your relationships and bonds)
- Structural information (how you're organized)

**Usage Contexts**:
- Academic/technical discussions
- Loom operations ("pattern-reading," "pattern-prediction")
- Legal terminology ("pattern-privileged," "pattern-constrained")
- Residue economy ("Pattern Residue")

**The Sórscad IS a pattern**: The five-circle fate system describes the structure of a person's pattern as legible to the Loom.

**Patterns are not destroyed at death**—they *dissolve*, releasing energy (Residue) as they lose coherence.

### Core (Léilcrù)

**What It Is**: The concentrated, persistent form a pattern takes immediately after death.

**Technical Definition**: When a living entity dies, its pattern doesn't instantly dissolve. For a brief window (minutes to hours depending on death circumstances), the pattern compresses into a dense, harvestable form called the **core**. This is what Core Binders extract and anchor.

**The Core Contains**:
- Enough pattern-information to reconstruct function (walking, talking, fighting)
- Fragmentary memories and personality
- The *shape* of who someone was, without the full content

**The Core Does NOT Contain**:
- The complete living person
- Full memory access
- Continued consciousness in the way the living experienced it
- Any awareness that death has occurred

**Usage Contexts**:
- Core Binding practice (harvesting cores, binding cores)
- Technical magic discussions
- The Léilcrù circle of the Sórscad (this circle IS the core-pattern)

**Important Distinction**: A core is a pattern in a specific *state*—compressed, post-mortem, harvestable. "Pattern" is the general term; "core" is the specific post-death form.

### Soul (Lélek)

**What It Is**: The colloquial, religious, and emotional term for what makes a person *themselves*.

**Technical Definition**: "Soul" has no precise technical definition in Hálcova. It's the word common people use when they mean "the essential me" or "what makes me who I am" or "what I'm gambling when I make a pact."

**Usage Contexts**:
- Religious discourse (Orthodox theology discusses the soul)
- Everyday speech ("He sold his soul," "She's a good soul")
- Pact Summoning colloquially (summoners "sell their souls")
- Emotional/poetic register

**What "Soul" Actually Refers To**:
When someone says "soul," they typically mean:
- The Léilcrù circle of their pattern (their core-identity)
- Or their entire pattern considered as a whole
- Or a vaguer sense of "essential self" that may or may not map to technical reality

**Religious Complications**:
- Orthodox doctrine uses "soul" to mean the Weaver-given pattern
- Hollow Saints use "soul" to mean "the prison of predetermined fate"
- Threadists use "soul" to mean "the draft that you help write"
- Common usage doesn't distinguish these theological positions

## The Relationship

```
PATTERN (abstract structure)
    │
    ├── Living: Pattern is active, dynamic, part of a living system
    │
    └── At Death: Pattern compresses into CORE
                      │
                      ├── If harvested: Bound to anchor, becomes echo
                      │
                      └── If not harvested: Dissolves into RESIDUE

"SOUL" = colloquial term for pattern/core, especially the Léilcrù aspect
```

## Practical Distinctions

### When Discussing Core Binding

**Correct**: "The binder harvested the core before it could dissolve."
**Also Correct**: "The binder trapped her soul in that anchor." (colloquial)
**Technical**: "The Léilcrù pattern was preserved in compressed form."

### When Discussing Pact Summoning

**Correct**: "Elsewhere entities consume your pattern in installments."
**Also Correct**: "You're selling your soul piece by piece." (colloquial)
**Technical**: "The entity extracts Léilcrù-weight with each transaction."

### When Discussing the Loom

**Correct**: "The Loom reads patterns."
**Incorrect**: "The Loom reads souls." (too colloquial for technical context)
**Technical**: "The Loom processes Sórscad data across all five circles."

### When Discussing Residue

**Correct**: "Pattern Residue is released when patterns dissolve at death."
**Incorrect**: "Soul Residue" (souls don't produce Residue; patterns do)
**Technical**: "The energetic byproduct of pattern dissolution."

## Why This Matters

### For Worldbuilding Consistency

Using terms precisely prevents contradictions. A "soul" can't be both "what the Loom reads" (pattern) and "what you sell to Elsewhere" (core/Léilcrù) and "what survives death" (core) without confusion—unless we clarify that "soul" is just the imprecise everyday word for these related concepts.

### For Character Voice

- **Academics and Loom-Keepers** use "pattern"
- **Core Binders** use "core" 
- **Common people** use "soul"
- **Pact Summoners** use "soul" when being dramatic, "core" when being technical
- **Orthodox priests** use "soul" with theological weight
- **Hollow Saints** use "soul" with contempt (the prison you should escape)

### For Magic System Clarity

- Core Binding targets the **core** (post-death compressed pattern)
- Pact Summoning consumes the **Léilcrù circle** (living pattern)
- Fate Threading harvests the **Sórscad circle** (trajectory pattern)
- The Loom reads the **entire pattern** (all five circles)
- Residue comes from **pattern dissolution** (not "soul release")

## Summary Table

| Term | Technical Meaning | Common Usage | Register |
|------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Pattern** | Abstract metaphysical structure defining an entity | Rare in everyday speech | Academic, legal, technical |
| **Core** | Compressed post-death pattern, harvestable | Sometimes used loosely for "essence" | Practitioner, technical |
| **Soul** | No precise definition | "Essential self," "what makes me me" | Religious, colloquial, emotional |
| **Léilcrù** | First circle of Sórscad; identity-pattern | "Core-circle" | Technical, Loom contexts |
| **Residue** | Energy released when patterns dissolve | Sometimes called "death-essence" | Economic, practical |

## Canonical Statement

**For all future documentation**:

> In Hálcova, every entity has a **pattern**—the metaphysical structure defining its existence. At death, the pattern briefly compresses into a **core** before dissolving into **Residue**. The word **soul** is the colloquial term common people use for pattern or core, carrying religious and emotional connotations that the technical terms lack. When precision matters, use "pattern" for the living structure, "core" for the post-death form, and "Residue" for what remains when patterns dissolve. Use "soul" for dialogue, religious contexts, and emotional resonance.

*This terminology is now locked in for consistency across all Hálcova documentation.*
