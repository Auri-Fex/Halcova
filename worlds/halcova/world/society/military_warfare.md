# Military and Warfare

## Overview

Warfare in Hálcova is pre-gunpowder in character but modified by the Five Arts and the Residue economy. War is not merely political—it's economically productive, generating the Residue that civilization requires. This creates perverse incentives: prolonged, casualty-heavy conflicts serve economic interests even when they undermine political goals.

## Army Structures

### The Crown Army (Heartlands)

**Composition**:
- Professional core: ~15,000 standing soldiers
- Levy system: Can mobilize ~50,000 additional
- Warden Order attachment: 500-1,000 for pattern-enforcement
- Practitioner support: 50-100 across the Five Arts

**Organization**:
- **Regiments**: 500-1,000 soldiers, commanded by Colonel
- **Companies**: 100-200 soldiers, commanded by Captain
- **Squads**: 20-40 soldiers, commanded by Sergeant
- **Crown Guard**: Elite unit protecting royal family (~500)

**Professional Soldiers**:
- Pay: 2-5 marks/month depending on rank
- Equipment provided
- Pattern-checked at recruitment
- Career path available for pattern-median and above

**Levies**:
- Raised from noble holdings
- Serve for campaign season
- Quality varies wildly
- Pattern-constrained often "volunteered" by lords

### Regional Forces

**The Reaches Navies**:
- No unified force—each major island maintains ships
- Combined strength: ~200 warships, ~10,000 sailors
- Skilled at boarding, navigation, coastal raids
- Confederation can theoretically coordinate; rarely does

**Vent Lands Guild Militia**:
- Each guild maintains trained fighters
- Combined strength: ~20,000 trained militia
- Equipment superior (geothermal-forged)
- Fight for guild interests, not external conquest

**Far Shelf War Bands**:
- No standing armies
- Clan-based mobilization
- ~30,000 potential fighters across all clans
- Guerrilla tactics, cold-weather expertise
- Never unified; coordinate against external threats

### The Warden Order (Military Capacity)

**Combat Role**:
- Not a conventional army
- Specialists in pattern-enforcement
- Can attach to any military force
- Direct combat only against practitioners and deviants

**Strength**:
- ~5,000 active Wardens across all regions
- ~500 capable of serious combat
- The Attuned have enhanced capabilities
- Fate Hound packs (~200 animals total)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot be ordered by secular authorities
- Won't fight conventional battles
- Primary mission is enforcement, not warfare
- Political independence maintained carefully

## Weapons and Equipment

### Personal Weapons

**Melee**:
- Swords (arming swords, longswords, great swords)
- Polearms (spears, halberds, pikes)
- Axes (battle axes, hand axes)
- Maces and war hammers (against armor)
- Daggers (universal backup)

**Ranged**:
- Crossbows (most common military ranged weapon)
- Longbows (Reaches specialty)
- Thrown weapons (javelins, axes)
- No firearms

**Why Crossbows Dominate**:
- Easier training than longbows
- Effective against armor at medium range
- Pattern-constrained soldiers can use effectively
- Mechanical advantage compensates for low individual skill

### Armor

**Types**:
- Mail (common for professional soldiers)
- Plate (expensive, elite troops and officers)
- Brigandine (intermediate, common for levies)
- Leather and padded (light troops, poor soldiers)
- Cold-weather modifications essential

**Pattern-Woven Armor**:
- Incorporates fate-symbols
- Expensive luxury for the wealthy
- Rumored to affect incoming fate-strikes
- Effectiveness debated

### Siege Equipment

**Offensive**:
- Trebuchets (standard siege weapon)
- Battering rams
- Siege towers
- Mining and sapping

**Defensive**:
- Stone fortifications (castles, city walls)
- Crossbow positions
- Burning pitch and oil
- Pattern-engine defenses (major installations only)

## Tactics and Strategy

### Battlefield Tactics

**Standard Formation**:
- Pike/spear infantry in center
- Crossbowmen on flanks or behind
- Cavalry on wings
- Reserve for exploitation or emergency

**Cavalry Roles**:
- Heavy cavalry: Shock action, breaking formations
- Light cavalry: Scouting, flanking, pursuit
- Mounted crossbowmen (Reaches specialty)

**The Weather Factor**:
- Campaigns largely limited to Láng and early Hanyatlás
- Csend warfare is desperate defense only
- Olvadás makes ground treacherous
- Köd is avoided (Elsewhere complications)

### Practitioner Warfare

**Core Binders**:
- Interrogate dead enemies
- Maintain communication with fallen commanders
- Psychological warfare (echoes of the enemy's dead)
- Not frontline fighters

**Flesh Shapers**:
- Medical support (invaluable)
- Enhanced soldiers (expensive, limited)
- Homunculi as scouts or expendable troops
- Not frontline unless modified for combat

**Pact Summoners**:
- Devastating but unreliable
- Entity abilities vary wildly
- May refuse to fight (pact terms)
- Can turn battles single-handedly—or betray their side

**Fate Threaders**:
- Intelligence and reconnaissance
- Seeing enemy plans before they happen
- Limited combat application
- Extremely valuable, heavily protected

**Colony Hosts**:
- Disease warfare (spreading colonies to enemies)
- Terrain adaptation
- Feared and distrusted by all sides
- Often kept in reserve or segregated

### Naval Warfare

**Ship Types**:
- War galleys (oar-powered, ramming)
- Sailing warships (longer range, less maneuverable)
- Coastal raiders (small, fast)
- Troop transports

**Tactics**:
- Ramming to disable
- Boarding for capture
- Fire ships (desperate measure)
- Blockade (controlling ports)

**The Reaches Advantage**:
- Best sailors, best ships
- Knowledge of waters
- Coordination through trade networks
- Can defeat any single power at sea

## The Residue Economy of War

### War as Production

**The Dark Calculation**:
- Every battlefield death produces Residue
- Heavy pattern deaths produce more
- Concentrated death sites are efficient to harvest
- War is the most efficient Residue production method

**Who Benefits**:
- Residue harvesters follow armies
- The Church collects from battlefields
- Trade in battlefield Residue is lucrative
- Some institutions have financial interest in prolonged conflict

### The Harvest

**How It Works**:
- Licensed harvesters accompany military forces
- Immediate collection from fresh deaths
- Quality degrades with time
- Competition for access to death sites

**Who Gets What**:
- Winning army controls harvest
- Treaties often include Residue terms
- Prisoners may be executed for Residue rather than ransomed
- The calculation affects strategic decisions

### War Finance

**Costs**:
- Soldiers' pay: 50,000-100,000 marks/month for major army
- Equipment: 100,000-500,000 marks for campaign
- Supplies: 20,000-50,000 marks/month
- Total campaign cost: Often exceeds 1,000,000 marks

**Revenue**:
- Battlefield Residue harvest
- Plunder and tribute
- Territory acquisition
- Long-term: weakened enemies, favorable trade terms

**The Balance**:
- Short wars often lose money
- Long wars can profit through Residue
- This incentivizes prolonged, casualty-heavy campaigns
- Peace treaties may be economically unfavorable

## The Warden Order in Combat

### Attunement Abilities

**Enhanced Perception**:
- Sense pattern-deviations
- Detect practitioners
- Track specific patterns across distance
- Navigate without getting lost

**Combat Enhancement**:
- Faster reactions (pattern-awareness of attacks)
- Resistance to fate-manipulation
- Can disrupt practitioner abilities
- Limited but real physical enhancement

**The Cost**:
- Attunement shortens lifespan
- Heavy combat use accelerates degradation
- Wardens "burn out" after years of intense activity
- Replacement training takes 5-7 years

### Fate Hounds

**What They Are**:
- Creatures modified through pattern-attunement
- Originally wolves, now something else
- Can track patterns across any distance
- Sense deviations before they happen

**Military Use**:
- Tracking fleeing practitioners
- Detecting infiltrators
- Disrupting enemy pattern-based abilities
- Terror weapon (their presence demoralizes)

**Limitations**:
- Expensive to maintain
- Cannot be fully controlled
- May turn on handlers if pattern corrupts
- ~200 exist across all regions

### Warden Combat Doctrine

**Primary Mission**: Neutralize enemy practitioners

**Approach**:
1. Identify practitioner presence through intelligence
2. Isolate practitioners from conventional forces
3. Engage with specialized Warden teams
4. Neutralize or capture for interrogation

**Rules of Engagement**:
- Wardens don't fight conventional battles
- Won't be subordinated to secular commanders
- Will withdraw rather than waste resources on non-practitioners
- Political independence is sacred

## Historical Conflicts

### The Pattern Wars (~-2,500 to -2,000)

**What Happened**:
- First large-scale conflicts over Loom access
- Multiple Heartlands kingdoms fighting for Node control
- Established that Loom control = political dominance

**Outcome**:
- Consolidation of Nodes under emerging powers
- Pattern-based hierarchy begins to form
- Precedent: winner controls the Loom

### The Pre-Integration Crisis (~-600 to -500)

**What Happened**:
- Major multi-regional war
- Three Heartlands kingdoms destroyed
- Population reduced ~30%
- Loom Nodes damaged

**Outcome**:
- Created conditions for the Integration
- Coalition formed to prevent repeat
- The Concordat and Warden Order established

### The Vent Lands Crisis (~290-310)

**What Happened**:
- Guild power challenged Concordat authority
- Limited war between Vent Lands and Heartlands
- Neither side could achieve decisive victory

**Outcome**:
- Increased Vent Lands autonomy
- Current guild-authority balance established
- Precedent: Vent Lands can defend themselves

### Current Tensions (Year 476)

**Active Conflicts**:
- Far Shelf resistance to colonial extraction (guerrilla)
- Middle Waters colonial disputes (proxy conflicts)
- Border skirmishes between Heartlands factions (contained)

**Potential Flashpoints**:
- Heartlands succession uncertainty
- Reaches independence movements
- Vent Lands guild ambitions
- Hollow Saint activity escalation

## Fortifications

### Castle Design

**Standard Features**:
- Thick stone walls (withstand trebuchet)
- Towers for crossbow positions
- Central keep (last refuge)
- Residue heating systems
- Pattern-engine room (major castles only)

**Cold-Weather Adaptations**:
- Underground storage and living spaces
- Multiple heat sources
- Ice-resistant construction
- Provisions for months-long siege in winter

### City Defenses

**Major Cities**:
- Double or triple wall systems
- Gates with pattern-checking capability
- Warden presence at entry points
- Underground passages (escape, supply)

**The Node Defense Problem**:
- Loom Nodes are the most valuable targets
- Also the most difficult to protect
- Concentrated Residue attracts attention
- Pattern-engines can't be moved easily

## Summary

Warfare in Hálcova is characterized by:

- **Pre-gunpowder technology**: Swords, crossbows, siege engines
- **Practitioner involvement**: Each Art contributes differently
- **Residue economics**: War is productive, creating perverse incentives
- **Seasonal constraints**: Winter limits campaigning
- **Warden Order**: Separate force focused on practitioners
- **Regional variation**: Each region has distinct military traditions

The horror of Hálcovan warfare isn't just the violence—it's that the economy depends on it. Peace is expensive. Death pays.
