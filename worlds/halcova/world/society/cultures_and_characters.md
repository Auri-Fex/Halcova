## Legends People Tell

### The Heartlands

**The First Crown:**
"Before the Integration, there were seven kings who warred endlessly. The Weaver, tired of the bloodshed, sent a vision to the seventh king's daughter: unite them under one crown, one pattern, one law. She did—some say through diplomacy, some say through poison, some say through both. The first Crown was made from the melted-down crowns of the other six. It still holds their patterns, they say. The Crown knows what the dead kings knew."

### The Reaches

**The Drowned Fleet:**
"A hundred ships, they say, tried to find the edge of the world. They sailed south, past the ice, looking for the place where the sky meets the sea. Only one came back, crewed by ghosts. The captain still lives, they say—you can find him in the deepest tavern of any island, if you know how to look. He'll tell you what he saw, but only once, and only if you're about to die anyway."

### The Middle Waters

**The First Host:**
"The colonies came from the south, from beneath the volcanic islands. But they didn't come as parasites—they came as friends. The first person to welcome them was a woman dying of a disease no healer could cure. The colony saved her life. In exchange, she opened her body to them, and they lived together for a hundred years. When she finally died, the colony wept—real tears from borrowed eyes. Every Colony Host since has been part of that original friendship."

### The Vent Lands

**The Unfinished Work:**
"The greatest master-smith of the old days was working on something that would change everything. No one knows what—a weapon, a tool, a lock, a key. He died before finishing it. His ghost haunts the deep forges, they say, still working. Sometimes an apprentice finds a piece they didn't make, perfect beyond skill. That's the ghost, they say, still trying to finish. Maybe someday someone will understand what he was making."

### The Far Shelf

**The Things Beneath the Ice:**
"Before the cold, the south was warm. Cities stood there, great ones. When the cold came, they didn't die—they went beneath. They're still there, under the ice, waiting. Sometimes hunters find holes that breathe warm air. Sometimes travelers hear music from nowhere. The old ones say: never dig too deep. Never follow the warm air. What's down there isn't for us—not yet. Maybe not ever."
