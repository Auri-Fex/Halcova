# Law and Justice

## Legal Systems Overview

Hálcova operates under multiple overlapping legal jurisdictions. Pattern status affects both substantive law (what's illegal) and procedural law (how justice is administered). The result is a system where your fate-reading influences your legal outcomes.

**Mutilation**:
- Theft (hand)
- Perjury (tongue)
- Pattern fraud (brand on face)

**Corporal Punishment**:
- Flogging (common for lesser crimes)

- Failure to pay converts to other punishment

**Exile/Outlawry**:
- Banishment from territory
- Loss of legal protection (anyone may kill an outlaw)
- Used for serious but non-capital crimes

**Pattern-Correction**:
- Concordat-administered facilities
- Labor under pattern-suppression conditions
- High mortality (produces Residue)
- Theoretically rehabilitative; practically punitive

## Courts and Procedure

### Crown Courts

**Hierarchy**:
- **Manorial Courts**: Local justice, minor matters
- **County Courts**: Regional justice, serious matters
- **Royal Courts**: Appeals, major cases, crown interests
- **Crown Assizes**: Traveling courts bringing royal justice to regions

**Procedure**:
1. Accusation (by victim, witness, or official)
2. Investigation (variable thoroughness)
3. Arraignment (charges presented)
4. Trial (evidence presented, pattern-readings if relevant)
5. Verdict (judge or jury depending on region)
6. Sentencing (guided by precedent, pattern-status)
7. Appeal (if available)

**Evidence**:
- Witness testimony
- Physical evidence
- Confessions (torture permitted for serious crimes)
- Pattern-readings (highly influential)
- Character witnesses (pattern-privileged testimony worth more)

**Pattern-Reading as Evidence**:
- "Does their pattern suggest this crime?"
- "What does their Sórscad indicate about truthfulness?"
- "Is this behavior deviation from pattern?"
- Readings are not dispositive but heavily influential

### Concordat Courts

**Jurisdiction**: Pattern crimes, practitioner crimes, deviation cases

**Procedure**:
- Warden investigation
- Concordat tribunal (three Loom-Keepers minimum)
- Pattern-reading central to proceedings
- No jury; tribunal decides
- Limited appeal (to regional, then central Concordat)

**The Deviation Trial**:
- Is the accused's behavior deviation from pattern?
- If deviation, was it knowing/voluntary?
- If knowing, was it with malicious intent?
- Pattern-correction vs. execution depends on answers

### Church Courts

**Jurisdiction**: Heresy, blasphemy, clerical discipline, some family law

**Procedure**:
- Inquisitorial (court investigates and judges)
- Confession encouraged (torture if necessary)
- Spiritual and temporal penalties
- Can "relax" convicted heretics to secular authority for execution

**The Heresy Trial**:
- Does the accused hold forbidden beliefs?
- Have they spread those beliefs?
- Will they recant?
- Recantation = penance; refusal = execution

### Guild Courts

**Jurisdiction**: Trade disputes, quality violations, member discipline

**Procedure**:
- Guild masters serve as judges
- Quick resolution valued
- Penalties: fines, suspension, expulsion
- Appeals to guild council

## Legal Status and Rights

### Pattern-Privileged

**Legal Advantages**:
- Testimony worth more in court
- Higher burden of proof to convict
- Fines rather than corporal punishment (more often)
- Access to better advocates
- Pattern-reading interpreted favorably

**Legal Obligations**:
- Higher fines when convicted
- Greater expectations of proper behavior
- Public shaming more severe (more to lose)

### Pattern-Median

**Legal Position**:
- Standard treatment under law
- Pattern-readings matter but aren't determinative
- Access to basic legal representation
- Subject to full range of penalties

### Pattern-Constrained

**Legal Disadvantages**:
- Testimony worth less
- Pattern-readings interpreted against them
- More likely to receive corporal/capital punishment
- Less access to legal representation
- "Pattern suggests criminality" used to justify conviction

**The Vicious Cycle**:
- Pattern predicts criminality → more policing → more arrests → more convictions → pattern confirmed
- System produces the outcomes it predicts

### Pattern-Illegible

**Uncertain Status**:
- Practitioners whose patterns are corrupted
- Courts may not know how to evaluate
- Some regions exclude pattern evidence entirely
- Others treat illegibility as evidence of wrongdoing

---

## Specific Legal Issues

### Contract Law

**Formation**:
- Offer, acceptance, consideration (standard)
- Pattern-verification optional but common for major contracts
- Pattern-incompatibility may void contract in some jurisdictions

**Enforcement**:
- Courts will enforce valid contracts
- Damages or specific performance available
- Pattern-status affects credibility of claims
- Contracts can include Residue-rights, substitution-rights

### Property Law

**Real Property**:
- Crown ultimately owns all land
- Grants create rights to possess, use, transfer
- Registration required for valid transfer
- Inheritance follows customary rules

**Personal Property**:
- Ownership by possession or purchase
- Theft punishable
- Pattern-woven goods have special status

### Family Law

**Marriage**:
- Requires pattern-compatibility check (Orthodox regions)
- Can be arranged or consensual depending on status
- Divorce rare but possible (Church jurisdiction)
- Property rights determined by marriage contract

**Inheritance**:
- Primogeniture standard but not universal
- Wills respected within limits
- Pattern-constrained may face inheritance challenges
- Death taxes apply above threshold

**Guardianship**:
- Children under parent/guardian authority
- Orphans become wards of family, Church, or Crown
- Pattern-status of child affects placement

### Criminal Procedure Rights

**What Exists**:
- Right to know charges
- Right to present defense
- Right to call witnesses
- Right to appeal (limited)

**What Doesn't Exist**:
- Right to advocate (not guaranteed)
- Right against self-incrimination (torture is legal)
- Presumption of innocence (pattern-readings undermine this)
- Speedy trial (delays common)

---

## The Warden Order and Law

### Special Authority

**What Wardens Can Do**:
- Detain suspected deviants without warrant
- Conduct pattern-readings without consent
- Enter premises searching for practitioners
- Execute pattern-criminals in the field (extreme cases)
- Override secular authority on pattern matters

**Limits**:
- Cannot try non-pattern crimes
- Cannot execute without tribunal approval (theoretically)
- Must coordinate with secular authority (theoretically)
- Subject to Concordat oversight

### Conflict with Secular Law

**When Jurisdictions Clash**:
- Pattern crimes can overlap with secular crimes
- Wardens may claim jurisdiction over murder if practitioner involved
- Crown may resist Warden authority in political cases
- Resolution depends on relative power

**The Noble Problem**:
- Pattern-privileged nobles may resist Warden authority
- Political consequences of arresting powerful figures
- Some families are effectively immune
- This creates resentment and selective enforcement

---

## Justice in Practice

### Who Gets Justice

**The Pattern-Privileged**:
- Can afford advocates
- Pattern-readings favor them
- Fines rather than mutilation
- Connections provide protection
- System works for them

**The Pattern-Constrained**:
- Can't afford advocates
- Pattern-readings condemn them
- Subject to harsh penalties
- No connections for protection
- System works against them

### Corruption

**Common Forms**:
- Bribes to officials (case dismissal, favorable ruling)
- Witness intimidation
- Evidence manipulation
- Selective enforcement
- Pattern-reading fraud

**How Widespread**:
- Endemic at lower levels
- More limited at higher courts
- Warden Order relatively clean (Attunement?)
- Church courts variable

### Access to Justice

**For Victims**:
- Pattern-privileged victims get attention
- Pattern-constrained victims often ignored
- Property crimes prioritized over personal crimes (for poor)
- Powerful perpetrators often escape justice

**For Accused**:
- Wealth provides defense
- Pattern-status affects outcome
- The innocent pattern-constrained may be convicted
- The guilty pattern-privileged may escape

---

## Summary

The legal system of Hálcova is characterized by:

- **Multiple jurisdictions**: Crown, Concordat, Church, Guild, Custom
- **Pattern-influenced outcomes**: Status affects everything
- **Harsh penalties**: Death, mutilation, correction facilities
- **Limited rights**: No presumption of innocence, torture legal
- **Selective enforcement**: Power and pattern determine who faces justice

The system produces order but not fairness. It maintains stability but creates resentment. It enforces pattern-orthodoxy while enabling pattern-privilege.
