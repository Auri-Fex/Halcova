# Economics Beyond Residue

## Currency Systems

### The Mark Standard

**The Mark** is the base currency across most of Hálcova:

| Denomination | Value | Material | Common Use |
|--------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Copper penny | 1/100 mark | Copper | Daily purchases |
| Silver quarter | 1/4 mark | Silver | Standard trade |
| Silver mark | 1 mark | Silver | Major purchases |
| Gold crown | 10 marks | Gold | Large transactions |
| Weighted crown | 100 marks | Gold (heavier) | Institutional dealings |

**Purchasing Power** (approximate):
- 1 penny: A loaf of bread, a mug of ale
- 5 pennies: A simple meal
- 1 quarter mark: A day's unskilled wages
- 1 mark: A week's unskilled wages, a simple garment
- 5 marks: A month's skilled labor, a quality tool
- 50 marks: A year's apprentice wages, a horse
- 500 marks: A small house, a business stake
- 5,000 marks: A substantial property, a merchant ship

**Regional Variations**:
- The Heartlands uses the mark standard (Crown-minted)
- The Reaches uses marks but also local coinage (variable exchange)
- The Middle Waters uses mixed currencies (colonial and indigenous)
- The Vent Lands mints guild-backed marks (slightly higher value)
- The Far Shelf trades in goods more than coin

### Banking and Credit

**Formal Banking**:
- Temple banks (Church-affiliated, oldest institutions)
- Merchant banks (guild-backed, trade-focused)
- Crown banks (government-backed, limited)
- Pattern-lending houses (credit based on Sórscad readings)

**Services**:
- Deposits and withdrawals
- Letters of credit (for long-distance trade)
- Loans (pattern-assessed interest rates)
- Currency exchange
- Residue accounts (storing value in Residue rather than coin)

**Interest Rates** (annual):
- Pattern-privileged: 5-10%
- Pattern-median: 10-15%
- Pattern-constrained: 15-25%
- Pattern-illegible: Varies wildly (or credit refused)

**Debt Instruments**:
- Standard loans (collateral-backed)
- Pattern-pledged loans (your fate as collateral)
- Residue-rights loans (your death's Residue as collateral)
- Substitution-rights loans (yourself as collateral for pact payment)

## Labor Markets

### Wage Structure

**Unskilled Labor** (daily):
- Pattern-privileged: 5-8 pennies
- Pattern-median: 3-5 pennies
- Pattern-constrained: 1-3 pennies
- The gap is legal, documented, "actuarially justified"

**Skilled Labor** (daily):
- Journeyman: 10-20 pennies
- Master craftsman: 25-50 pennies
- Specialty skills: 50+ pennies

**Professional Rates** (annual):
- Minor official: 50-100 marks
- Physician: 100-300 marks
- Pattern-reader: 200-500 marks
- Loom-Keeper: 300-1000 marks
- Guild Master: 500-2000 marks

### Guild System

**Structure**:
- Apprentice: 7-year term, room and board, no wages
- Journeyman: Wages, must travel, seeking master status
- Master: Full guild rights, can train apprentices, vote in guild
- Grand Master: Guild leadership, political influence

**Guild Functions**:
- Quality control
- Price setting
- Training standards
- Market protection
- Political representation

**Major Guilds**:
- Metalworkers (Vent Lands dominant)
- Weavers (Heartlands dominant)
- Shipwrights (Reaches dominant)
- Merchants (cross-regional)
- Pattern-readers (Concordat-affiliated)

### Unfree Labor

**Debt Bondage**:
- Those who cannot repay debts work them off
- Terms set by creditors (often indefinite)
- Common among pattern-constrained
- Legal but regulated (theoretically)

**Indentured Service**:
- Contractual labor for fixed terms
- Common for immigrants, criminals
- Better than debt bondage (definite end)
- Often exploited

**Pattern-Assigned Labor**:
- The Warden Order can assign labor to "correction facilities"
- Those who deviate too severely from pattern
- Dangerous, unpleasant work
- Often fatal (producing Residue)

## Property and Ownership

### Land Tenure

**Crown Lands**:
- Ultimately, all land belongs to the Crown
- Granted to nobles, institutions, individuals
- Grants can be revoked (rarely, for cause)

**Noble Holdings**:
- Great families hold extensive lands
- Rights include taxation, justice, military levy
- Pattern-privileged tend to remain landowning

**Church Lands**:
- Temples, monasteries own significant territory
- Not taxable by Crown
- Pattern-enforcement jurisdiction

**Common Holdings**:
- Villages have shared lands (pasture, forest)
- Rights are customary, not legal
- Enclosure pressure increasing

**Individual Property**:
- Homes, shops, small plots
- Registered, taxed, inheritable
- Pattern-status affects what you can own (in practice)

### Intellectual Property

**Guild Secrets**:
- Techniques protected by guild membership
- Unauthorized practice is punishable
- No formal patent system

**Pattern Information**:
- Your Sórscad is yours, but also in the Registry
- Unauthorized access to Registry data is criminal
- Pattern-brokers sell aggregated data legally

### Inheritance

**Primogeniture** (most common):
- Eldest son inherits title and primary lands
- Other children receive smaller portions
- Daughters inherit if no sons

**Guild Property**:
- Master status is not inheritable
- But children have preference in apprenticeship
- Tools and shop may pass within family

**Pattern and Inheritance**:
- Pattern-privilege tends to reproduce (70% correlation)
- But is not legally inheritable
- A constrained heir may inherit but face social barriers

---

## Taxation

### Crown Taxes

**Land Tax**:
- On agricultural production
- ~10% of harvest value
- Paid in kind or coin

**Trade Tax**:
- On goods entering/leaving regions
- 5-10% at borders, ports
- Major revenue source

**Poll Tax**:
- Flat rate per adult
- Pattern-adjusted in some jurisdictions
- Unpopular, difficult to collect

**Death Tax**:
- On inheritances above threshold
- 5-20% depending on relationship
- Does not apply to Residue (separate system)

### Church Tithes

**Required Giving**:
- 10% of income to the Church (theoretical)
- Actual collection varies
- The wealthy negotiate; the poor pay

**Pattern-Adjustment**:
- Some argue tithe should be pattern-adjusted
- Orthodox position: all owe equally to the Weaver
- In practice, enforcement is uneven

### Residue Levies

**Separate System**:
- Residue is taxed differently than goods
- Crown takes percentage of harvested Residue
- Church takes percentage for Loom operation
- Rates vary by region and political arrangement

**Typical Distribution**:
- Harvester keeps: 40-60%
- Crown tax: 10-20%
- Church levy: 10-15%
- Transport/processing: 10-20%

## Economic Institutions

### The Crown Treasury

**Functions**:
- Minting currency
- Collecting taxes
- Paying officials and military
- Managing Crown lands revenue

**Limitations**:
- Chronic deficits (expenses exceed revenue)
- Dependent on noble cooperation for tax collection
- Residue income controlled more by Church than Crown

### The Concordat Economic Arm

**Functions**:
- Operating the Loom network (paid by Residue income)
- Pattern-verification services (fees)
- Loom-Keeper training and certification
- Registry maintenance

**Revenue Sources**:
- Church tithes (portion)
- Direct Residue levies
- Pattern-reading fees
- Institutional grants

### Merchant Houses

**Major Players**:
- Cross-regional trading companies
- Often family-based, multi-generational
- Political influence through wealth
- Pattern-privileged families dominant

**Functions**:
- Long-distance trade
- Banking services
- Insurance
- Political lobbying

---

## Economic Crises and Cycles

### The Peace Problem

**Mechanism**:
- War produces Residue abundantly
- Peace reduces Residue supply
- Prices spike during extended peace
- Economic pressure builds for conflict

**Historical Pattern**:
- Major wars every 30-50 years
- Peace treaties include Residue agreements
- Some "border conflicts" are economically managed

### Plague Economics

**When Disease Strikes**:
- Mass death produces Residue surplus
- Prices collapse temporarily
- Labor shortage drives wage increases
- Long-term economic disruption

**Management**:
- Some argue plagues are deliberately allowed to run
- The Concordat denies this
- Residue harvesters follow plague zones

### The Colonial Extraction Model

**How It Works**:
- Heartlands imports Residue from peripheral regions
- Peripheral regions export death, receive manufactured goods
- Trade terms favor the center
- Pattern-enforcement is lighter in colonies (need population)

**Tensions**:
- Far Shelf resistance to extraction
- Middle Waters colonial conflicts
- Reaches playing Heartlands against itself
- The system requires periphery to accept unfavorable terms

---

## Summary

The economy beyond Residue includes:
- **Currency**: The mark standard, with pattern-adjusted credit
- **Banking**: Temple banks, merchant banks, pattern-lending
- **Trade**: Agricultural, textile, metal, luxury goods
- **Labor**: Guild system, pattern-adjusted wages, unfree labor
- **Property**: Crown-derived land tenure, guild secrets
- **Taxation**: Crown taxes, Church tithes, Residue levies

The Residue economy overlays but doesn't replace conventional economics. Both systems interact, with pattern-status affecting participation in both.
