# Family, Kinship, and Gender

## Family Structures

### The Standard Household (Heartlands Model)

**Composition**:
- Nuclear family core (parents + children)
- Extended family often nearby
- Servants/dependents in wealthy households
- Apprentices count as quasi-family members

**Authority**:
- Patriarchal in law (father/husband as head)
- Matriarchal in practice for domestic matters
- Children under parental authority until marriage (or pattern-independence)
- Pattern-privileged households have more resources, more stability

### Regional Variations

**Shattered Reaches**:
- Ship-based extended families
- "Crew" can be adopted kin
- Matrilineal traditions on some islands
- Women can be ship captains, property owners

**Middle Waters**:
- Nuclear families weakened by colonial disruption
- Colony Host communities have collective child-rearing
- Indigenous traditions vary by island
- More fluid household composition

**Vent Lands**:
- Guild membership affects family structure
- Apprentices effectively adopted
- Master-journeyman relationships as pseudo-kinship
- Guild halls as extended family

**Far Shelf**:
- Clan-based extended families
- Nomadic groups share child-rearing
- Multiple-generation households in settlements
- Matrilineal traditions among some groups

## Marriage Customs

### The Pattern-Compatibility Check

**Orthodox Requirement**:
In strictly Orthodox regions, marriage requires pattern-compatibility verification.

**What's Checked**:
- Sórscad compatibility (do patterns complement?)
- Predicted offspring patterns (what will children likely draw?)
- Fate-trajectory alignment (will futures support each other?)
- Red flags (patterns that historically produce conflict)

**How It Works**:
- Couple's patterns submitted to Loom-Keeper
- Reading performed (fee: 2-10 marks)
- Results provided to families
- Strong incompatibility = social/religious pressure against marriage
- Legal prohibition rare but exists in some jurisdictions

**Gaming the System**:
- The wealthy get multiple readings until favorable
- Pattern-readers can be bribed
- Families negotiate which incompatibilities to ignore
- Love matches between incompatible patterns face obstacles

### Marriage Types

**Arranged Marriage**:
- Common among pattern-privileged
- Families negotiate terms
- Pattern-compatibility prioritized
- Consent technically required but pressured

**Love Match**:
- More common among pattern-median and below
- Pattern-checking still expected
- Families may disapprove if incompatible
- Social pressure significant

**Pattern-Neutral Marriage**:
- In regions with weak Loom coverage
- No formal pattern-check
- Based on family approval, personal choice
- Common in Far Shelf, some Reaches islands

**Informal Union**:
- Among the poor, pattern-constrained
- No formal ceremony or registration
- No legal protections
- May be only option if patterns are incompatible

### Marriage Ceremonies

**Orthodox**:
- Temple ceremony with priest
- Pattern certificates presented
- Vows include acceptance of combined fate
- Residue offering to the temple
- Registered in temple records

**Secular**:
- Contract signed before witnesses
- Property arrangements formalized
- May include pattern reference or not
- Common where Church authority is weak

### Divorce

**Grounds**:
- Infidelity (easier for men to claim)
- Abandonment
- Failure to produce children
- Severe cruelty
- Pattern-deviation (rarely, if one spouse becomes practitioner)

**Process**:
- Church court jurisdiction (Orthodox regions)
- Difficult to obtain; expensive
- Women face higher burden of proof
- Property division favors pattern-privileged spouse

**Alternatives**:
- Separation without divorce (common)
- Annulment (marriage invalid from start)
- Abandonment (illegal but practiced)

## Reproduction and Children

### Pattern Inheritance

**The Key Question**: Are patterns inherited?

**The Answer**: Partially, but not deterministically.

**What's Observed**:
- Children of pattern-privileged tend toward privilege (~70%)
- Children of pattern-constrained tend toward constraint (~70%)
- But neither is guaranteed
- Environment (where you're born, what District) affects draw

**Implications**:
- Pattern-privilege reproduces itself, mostly
- But families can rise or fall over generations
- Natal Draw is the great leveler/condemner
- This creates anxiety around childbirth

### Childbirth

**Mortality**:
- ~30-40% infant mortality in first year
- ~5-10% maternal mortality per birth
- Pattern-privileged have access to Flesh Shapers (better outcomes)
- Pattern-constrained rely on midwives

**The Natal Draw**:
- Performed within days of birth
- Three circles determined (Léilcrú, Húslaimh, Hálmaht)
- Results affect everything thereafter
- Bad draws may lead to abandonment, infanticide (illegal but practiced)

### Child-Rearing

**Pattern-Privileged Children**:
- Formal education (tutors, schools)
- Preparation for expected roles
- Pattern reinforcement (behave as your fate indicates)
- Inheritance protection

**Pattern-Constrained Children**:
- Work begins early (contributing to household)
- Informal or no education
- Pattern acceptance emphasized
- Survival skills prioritized

**The Binding Draw**:
- At adolescence (13-16), remaining circles drawn
- Major life event with ceremony
- Determines adult pattern-status
- Can confirm or upset childhood trajectory

### Adoption and Fostering

**Formal Adoption**:
- Transfers legal parentage
- Adopted child inherits (usually at lesser share)
- Pattern of adoptive family doesn't transfer
- Common for orphaned relatives

**Fostering**:
- Temporary placement without adoption
- Common across classes for various reasons
- Guild apprenticeship is a form of fostering
- Political alliances through fostering

**What Happens to Orphans**:
- Family members absorb them first
- Church institutions take some
- The pattern-constrained may become street children
- Crown wards (rare, usually pattern-privileged orphans)

## Gender

### Legal Status

**Men**:
- Property ownership unrestricted
- Can represent selves in court
- Head of household legally
- Military service expected (for privileged)
- Guild membership unrestricted (usually)

**Women**:
- Property ownership with restrictions (varies by region)
- May need male representation in some courts
- Domestic authority recognized
- Barred from some guilds and positions
- Can inherit (with limitations)

### Pattern and Gender

**Key Question**: Does gender affect pattern?

**The Orthodox Position**: No. Patterns are assigned without regard to sex.

**The Observed Reality**: 
- Pattern distribution appears gender-neutral
- But social interpretation differs
- A "strong" pattern may be praised in men, criticized in women
- Gender roles affect which pattern aspects are expressed

**Practitioner Gender**:
- Core Binding: Slightly more women (domestic association)
- Flesh Shaping: Slightly more men (guild association)
- Pact Summoning: Roughly equal
- Fate Threading: Roughly equal
- Colony Hosting: Roughly equal
- These patterns are cultural, not inherent

### Women's Roles

**Pattern-Privileged Women**:
- Household management
- Social networking (political significance)
- Property management (often)
- Patronage of arts, religion
- Can be significant political actors through influence

**Pattern-Constrained Women**:
- Labor alongside men
- Domestic work additional to other labor
- Fewer protections than men
- Vulnerable to exploitation

**Exceptional Women**:
- Ship captains in the Reaches
- Guild masters in some trades
- Loom-Keepers (some)
- Practitioners (no gender bar)
- Noble regents
- These are notable but not impossible

### Men's Roles

**Pattern-Privileged Men**:
- Political and military leadership expected
- Property management
- Family representation
- Guild and institutional leadership

**Pattern-Constrained Men**:
- Labor (often dangerous)
- Military service (levies)
- Family provider (insufficient resources)
- Pattern-correction targets (disproportionately)

### Sexuality

**Heterosexuality**: Normative for reproduction and inheritance

**Same-Sex Relations**:
- Not criminalized in most regions
- But not socially supported
- May be ignored if discrete
- Problems arise around inheritance, family continuity

**Pattern and Sexuality**:
- The Loom doesn't read sexual orientation
- Patterns don't predict or prescribe it
- This creates space—fate doesn't condemn it
- But culture may regardless

## Life Stages

### Childhood (Birth to Binding Draw)

- Under parental authority
- Pattern partially known (Natal Draw)
- Education/work according to status
- Identity forming but not fixed

### Youth (Binding Draw to Marriage/Guild Entry)

- Full pattern revealed
- Beginning adult path
- Courtship, apprenticeship
- Most vulnerable to pattern-correction

### Adulthood (Marriage to Old Age)

- Household formation
- Career/work established
- Raising children
- Community responsibilities

### Old Age

- Continued authority (if pattern-privileged)
- Dependency (if pattern-constrained)
- Preparing for death (Residue arrangements)
- Ancestor status anticipated

### Death

**Practical Matters**:
- Residue collection (by family, Church, or state)
- Property distribution
- Echo-binding decisions
- Funeral rites

**Spiritual Matters**:
- Orthodox: Return to the Weaver's design
- Heterodox: Various beliefs
- Echo-binding complicates "death" as concept

## Kinship Terms and Obligations

### Blood Kin

**Obligations**:
- Mutual support (economic, social, legal)
- Inheritance rights
- Vengeance rights (in some traditions)
- Pattern-solidarity (shared fate-concern)

**Limits**:
- Pattern-deviation may sever kinship
- Formal disownment possible
- Distance weakens ties

### Fictive Kinship

**Guild Brotherhood**:
- Master-apprentice as parent-child
- Fellow journeymen as siblings
- Guild as extended family

**Ship Kinship** (Reaches):
- Crew as family
- Captain as patriarch/matriarch
- Loyalty obligations similar to blood

**Colony Kinship** (Colony Hosts):
- Shared colony creates connection
- Network-communion bonds
- May supersede blood ties

### Patron-Client Relations

**Structure**:
- Patron provides protection, resources, opportunity
- Client provides loyalty, service, political support
- Not kinship but similar obligations
- Pattern-privileged as patrons; pattern-constrained as clients

---

## Summary

Family and kinship in Hálcova are shaped by:

- **Pattern-status**: Affects marriage options, child outcomes, resources
- **Regional variation**: Different family structures by region
- **Gender hierarchy**: Legal inequality modified by practical power
- **Life-stage expectations**: Pattern-determined trajectories
- **Kinship obligations**: Blood and fictive kin create networks

The family is where pattern-status reproduces itself—mostly. The possibility of pattern-change across generations creates both anxiety and hope.
