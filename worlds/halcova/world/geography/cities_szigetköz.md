# Szigetköz: The Harbor of Chains

## Overview

**Szigetköz** (SEE-get-kuhz, "Island-Crossing") is the largest settlement in the Shattered Reaches and the closest thing the island confederacy has to a capital, with a population of approximately 95,000. Built across seven islands connected by bridges, causeways, and ferry lines, the city serves as the central meeting point for the Reaches' notoriously independent captains and island lords.

Unlike Fonváros's centralized authority or Öntőváros's guild structure, Szigetköz operates on **negotiated chaos**—a constantly shifting web of alliances, debts, and agreements that somehow produces functional governance. The saying goes: "In Szigetköz, everything is for sale, including the people selling things."

The city's epithet, "Harbor of Chains," refers not to slavery (though that history exists) but to the chains of obligation, debt, and alliance that bind everyone to everyone else. No one stands alone here. No one is truly free. But everyone has leverage.

## Governance: The Captain's Council

### Structure

The **Captain's Council** (Kapitánytanács) governs Szigetköz and nominally coordinates the entire Reaches:

**Composition**:
- Any ship captain with registered vessel over 50 tons may attend
- Voting weighted by registered tonnage and proven voyage record
- Approximately 200-300 voting captains at any session
- Sessions held monthly, emergency sessions as needed

**The Harbor Master** (Kikötőmester):
- Elected by Council for three-year terms
- Manages daily port operations
- Controls harbor access (enormous power)
- Cannot own ships during term
- Current: **Captain Rozália Hullámtörő** (second term)

**The Five Admirals**:
- Senior captains elected to coordinate specific functions
- Admiral of Trade (commercial matters)
- Admiral of Defense (military coordination)
- Admiral of Justice (dispute resolution)
- Admiral of the Exterior (foreign relations)
- Admiral of the Chain (debt and alliance registry)

### The Chain System

**What Are Chains?**

Every significant relationship in Szigetköz is registered as a "chain"—a recorded obligation, debt, alliance, or bond:

**Types of Chains**:
- **Debt Chains**: Money owed, with terms
- **Service Chains**: Labor or action owed
- **Blood Chains**: Family obligations
- **Salt Chains**: Sworn alliances (salt = the sea)
- **Shadow Chains**: Obligations that aren't publicly registered (illegal but common)

**The Chain House**:
- Central registry on Captain's Island
- Records all legitimate chains
- Arbitrates disputes about chain interpretation
- Enforces chain obligations through collective action
- "Breaking chain" is the worst accusation

**How It Works**:
- Captain A owes Captain B 500 marks (debt chain)
- Captain A holds service chain on Merchant C (C must transport A's cargo)
- Captain B holds salt chain with Captain D (mutual defense)
- If A defaults to B, B can call on D, and D's chains activate...
- Complex web means everyone is invested in system stability

**Chain Politics**:
- Accumulating chains on others = power
- Being chained to others = vulnerability and protection
- Balancing chains = the political game
- "Chain-light" captains have freedom but no allies
- "Chain-heavy" captains have power but obligations

### Law and Justice

**The Admiral of Justice** handles disputes:

**Jurisdiction**:
- Matters between Reaches citizens
- Matters in Reaches waters
- Chain disputes
- Not: Internal ship matters (captain's authority) or foreign citizen matters (their consul)

**Process**:
- Accuser presents complaint
- Accused responds
- Admiral (or appointed judges) weighs evidence
- Judgment includes compensation and chain adjustments
- Refusal to accept judgment = outlawry (all chains void, no protection)

**Punishments**:
- Fines (most common)
- Chain obligations imposed
- Outlawry (social death)
- Physical punishment (rare, for violence)
- Actual execution (very rare, for chain-breaking and sanctuary violation)

**Pattern and Law**:
- Pattern readings available but not determinative
- "The sea doesn't care about your cards"
- Reaches justice focuses on actions, not predicted tendencies
- Warden Order has no authority (Reaches explicitly rejected)

---

## Economy

### Maritime Trade

**Szigetköz exists because trade exists**:

**What Flows Through**:
- Heartlands manufactured goods heading to Reaches islands
- Reaches fish, preserved foods, specialty products heading south
- Far Shelf furs and Ancient Residue transshipping
- Middle Waters colonial goods
- Everything that wants to avoid Heartlands customs

**The Reaches Advantage**:
- Strategic position between regions
- No unified authority to impose heavy taxes
- Expertise in maritime transport
- Willingness to carry anything for the right price

### The Auction Houses

**Where cargoes change hands**:

**How It Works**:
- Ships arrive, register cargo with Harbor Master
- Cargo assessed, auctioned at appropriate house
- Payment through Counting Houses
- Buyer arranges transport or storage
- Chain registry updated for credit transactions

**Specialized Houses**:
- **The Salt House**: Preserved fish and foods
- **The Iron House**: Metals and manufactured goods
- **The Bolt House**: Textiles and clothing
- **The Spice House**: Valuable small goods
- **The Shadow House**: (unofficial) Questionable cargoes

### Currency

**Multiple currencies circulate**:

**Crown Marks**: Accepted everywhere, baseline
**Guild Marks**: From Vent Lands, slight premium
**Reaches Shells** (Kagylópénz): Traditional currency, still used
**Chain Notes**: Promises backed by registered chains
**Foreign Coins**: From everywhere, exchanged at Counting Houses

**Exchange Rates Fluctuate**: Daily rates posted at Counting Houses

### Unique Economic Features

**Cargo Shares**:
- Ships often funded by shares sold to investors
- Shareholders get portion of voyage profits
- Common people can invest small amounts
- Creates broad interest in trade success

**Bottomry Bonds**:
- Loans secured against ship and cargo
- If ship sinks, loan forgiven
- If ship returns, loan repaid with interest
- Lenders take sea-risk for high returns

**Letter of Marque Trade**:
- In conflicts, Council issues letters allowing "privateering"
- Legal piracy against specified targets
- Very profitable, very dangerous
- Currently: None active (relative peace)

## The Loom in Szigetköz

### The Pattern House

**Contested Institution**:

The Reaches maintain a Loom node on Stranger's Island, but its authority is limited:

**What It Does**:
- Pattern readings for those who want them
- Registration for those who submit to it
- Predictions used by some merchants and captains

**What It Doesn't Do**:
- Mandatory registration (Reaches rejected this)
- Binding predictions for legal matters
- Warden Order enforcement (no Wardens in Reaches)
- Concordat control (Orthodox presence but not authority)

**The Reaches Position**:
- "Pattern is information, not destiny"
- Useful for planning, not for judging
- Individual choice whether to get read
- No official discrimination based on pattern

**Reality**:
- Many captains do check patterns for crew
- Merchants use readings for negotiations
- Insurance rates vary by pattern (quietly)
- Those refusing reading viewed with suspicion by some

### Practical Consequences

**Pattern-privileged in Reaches**: Some advantage, but less than Heartlands
**Pattern-constrained in Reaches**: Less disadvantage, but not equality
**Unread in Reaches**: Possible without major consequence (unlike elsewhere)

**The Reaches Attract**:
- Pattern-constrained fleeing Heartlands discrimination
- Illegible practitioners seeking freedom
- Anyone who wants out from under the Loom
- This creates distinctive population

---

## Religion and Culture

### Orthodox Presence

**Present but diminished**:
- Temple District on Stranger's Island
- Serves foreign community and some locals
- No official role in governance
- Competes with indigenous traditions

### Indigenous Traditions

**The Old Ways** persist in Reaches more than elsewhere:

**The Tide Singers**:
- Practitioners who claim to read fate in ocean patterns
- Compete with Loom-based prediction
- Popular with traditional fisher families
- Skeptics say it's superstition; believers say Loom is the fraud

**The Drowned Gods**:
- Belief in entities beneath the sea
- Not quite Elsewhere (or are they?)
- Offerings made before voyages
- Some ships carry shrine-keepers

**Salt-Binding**:
- Oaths sworn on salt water
- Considered more binding than Orthodox ceremonies by many
- "Salt-sworn" = absolutely trustworthy
- Breaking salt-oath = worse than chain-breaking

### Cultural Values

**What Reaches People Respect**:
- **Seamanship**: Ability matters more than birth
- **Boldness**: Fortune favors the daring
- **Word-Keeping**: Your reputation is everything
- **Adaptability**: The sea changes; you must too
- **Independence**: Nobody owns you but your chains

**What They Despise**:
- **Chain-Breaking**: Betraying obligations
- **Cowardice**: Especially at sea
- **Pretension**: Claiming status not earned
- **Landlubber Thinking**: Trying to impose shore rules on sea

---

## The Sanctuary Tradition

### Sacred Neutrality

**Szentély-sziget** maintains ancient tradition:

**Who Can Claim Sanctuary**:
- Anyone fleeing violence
- Anyone needing neutral ground for negotiation
- Hostages held for ransom or exchange
- The sick or wounded needing care

**What Sanctuary Means**:
- No violence against protected persons
- No seizure of protected persons
- Duration negotiated case-by-case
- Payment required for extended stays

**Enforcement**:
- Violating Sanctuary = death, no exceptions
- Collective enforcement by all captains
- The one rule no one breaks
- Even enemies honor it (their turn may come)

### The Hostage Economy

**Unusual but important**:

Valuable persons are often held as guarantees:
- **Treaty Hostages**: Ensuring alliance compliance
- **Debt Hostages**: Collateral for major loans
- **Family Hostages**: Ensuring good behavior
- **Ransom Hostages**: Captured persons awaiting payment

**Conditions**: Generally comfortable (damaging hostage violates chain)
**Exchange**: Complex negotiations, often through Sanctuary neutral parties
**Risk**: Hostage-taking is normal; mistreating hostages is not

## Current Tensions (Year 476)

### Internal Politics

**The Consolidation Faction**:
- Some major captains want stronger central authority
- Argue Reaches need unity to face external threats
- Want permanent Admiral positions, not rotating
- Opponents say this would make Reaches like Heartlands

**The Traditionalist Faction**:
- Resist any centralization
- "Our chaos is our freedom"
- Suspicious of Harbor Master's growing influence
- Want to maintain captain independence

**Harbor Master Hullámtörő**:
- Trying to balance factions
- Has accumulated significant chains
- Second term suggests broad support
- But also broad jealousy

### External Pressures

**Heartlands Push**:
- Crown wants more control over Reaches trade
- Pressure to accept Concordat authority over Pattern House
- Trade sanctions threatened
- Some captains favor accommodation; most resist

**Far Shelf Situation**:
- Reaches ships transport much Far Shelf trade
- Growing resistance there affects shipping
- Some Reaches captains profit from both sides
- Moral questions mostly ignored for profit questions

**Piracy Resurgence**:
- Unaffiliated pirates increasing (not Reaches licensed)
- Shipping losses rising
- Pressure for Admiral of Defense to act
- But expensive to patrol all Reaches waters

### The Pattern House Crisis

**Recent Events**:
- Concordat sent new Pattern House leadership
- Attempted to implement mandatory registration
- Captain's Council rejected it
- Current standoff: Concordat threatens to withdraw Loom access
- Many captains say "let them"—but merchants worried

**Stakes**:
- If Loom access cut, Reaches merchants disadvantaged in foreign trade
- If mandatory registration accepted, Reaches freedom diminished
- Harbor Master negotiating compromise
- Hardliners on both sides making compromise difficult

## Comparison: Three Cities

| Aspect | Fonváros | Öntőváros | Szigetköz |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Population | 250,000 | 180,000 | 95,000 |
| Governance | Crown + Concordat | Guild Congress | Captain's Council |
| Authority basis | Divine right + Pattern | Guild charter + Production | Chain obligations + Reputation |
| Pattern role | Determinative | Modified by guild | Informational only |
| Law enforcement | Watch + Wardens | Keepers' Guild | Admiral of Justice + collective |
| Social mobility | Very limited | Guild advancement | Proven capability |
| Religion | Orthodox dominant | Orthodox modified | Orthodox + indigenous |
| Economy | Administration + trade | Manufacturing | Maritime trade |
| Current crisis | Succession | Shaper scandal | Pattern House standoff |
| Culture | Hierarchical | Corporate | Individualist-networked |

---

## Summary

Szigetköz represents the third model:
- **Chain obligations** instead of Crown authority or guild structure
- **Maritime trade** instead of administration or production
- **Negotiated chaos** instead of centralized or corporate order
- **Reputation and capability** instead of birth or membership
- **Optional pattern** instead of mandatory or modified

It's the freest place in Hálcova—and freedom means you're responsible for your own protection, your own advancement, your own survival. The chains that bind are chains you chose to accept. The dangers you face are dangers you sailed into.

The question haunting Szigetköz: Can the old independence survive external pressure? Can tradition hold against consolidation? And what happens to the chaos that keeps them free if they need unity to survive?
