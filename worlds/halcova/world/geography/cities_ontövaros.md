# Öntőváros: The Guild Metropolis

## Overview

**Öntőváros** (UN-tuh-vah-rohsh, "Foundry City") is the largest city in the Vent Lands and the industrial heart of Hálcova, with a population of approximately 180,000. Unlike Fonváros, where the Crown rules and the Concordat reads fate, Öntőváros is governed by the **Guild Congress**—an assembly of trade associations that has maintained effective independence from royal authority for three centuries.

The city's name comes from its founding industry: the great bronze and iron foundries that still dominate the riverside. But Öntőváros has grown far beyond metalwork. Every major craft guild maintains headquarters here, and the city produces everything from precision instruments to homunculi to ships.

This is where things are *made*. And the people who make things have decided they should rule themselves.

## Geography and Layout

### Location

Öntőváros occupies both banks of the **Tűzfolyó** (TOOZ-foh-yoh, "Fire River"), named for the way foundry slag once made the water glow at night. The river provides:
- Hydropower for workshops and manufactories
- Transportation for raw materials and finished goods
- Cooling water for industrial processes
- A natural division between old and new city

The surrounding landscape is scarred by centuries of extraction—quarries, mines, clay pits, and timber operations radiate outward from the city.

### The Five Quarters

Unlike Fonváros's organic districts, Öntőváros was deliberately planned around guild functions.

#### 1. Mesterhegy (Master's Hill)

## Governance: The Guild Congress

### Structure

The **Guild Congress** (Céhgyűlés) is the governing body:

**The Twelve Great Guilds** (one vote each):
1. **Founders' Guild** (Öntőcéh) - Metalcasting, the original guild
2. **Smiths' Guild** (Kovácsscéh) - Metalworking and finishing
3. **Builders' Guild** (Építőcéh) - Construction and architecture
4. **Weavers' Guild** (Takácscéh) - Textiles and clothing
5. **Shapers' Guild** (Formálócéh) - Licensed Flesh Shapers
6. **Mechanics' Guild** (Gépészcéh) - Machinery and precision instruments
7. **Shipwrights' Guild** (Hajóépítőcéh) - Vessels and river craft
8. **Chemists' Guild** (Vegyészcéh) - Refineries and chemical processes
9. **Carriers' Guild** (Szállítócéh) - Transport and logistics
10. **Victualers' Guild** (Éléscéh) - Food production and distribution
11. **Keepers' Guild** (Őrzőcéh) - Security and order maintenance
12. **Clerks' Guild** (Írnokscéh) - Administration and records

**Lesser Guilds** (forty-seven, collective three votes):
- Specialized trades without Great Guild status
- Must petition Great Guilds for representation
- Can be elevated or demoted based on economic importance

### The Guild Master General

The **Guild Master General** (Főcéhmester) presides:
- Elected by Great Guilds for five-year terms
- Tiebreaker vote only
- Represents city in external relations
- Cannot hold other guild office during term

**Current**: Master General Erzsébet Vasököl, fourth term (unprecedented)
- 58, from Founders' Guild originally
- Pattern-privileged (Anchor/Road/Pact/Duty/Forge)
- Pragmatic, focused on guild prosperity over ideology
- Has maintained peace between factions for two decades

### Guild Law vs. Crown Law

**Within guild matters**: Guild law absolute
- Masters judge journeymen and apprentices
- Guild courts handle trade disputes
- Punishments include fines, demotion, expulsion
- No Crown appeal

**Between guilds**: Congress arbitration
- Disputes go to Congress committees
- Master General can impose binding resolution
- Rarely escalates beyond this

**Criminal matters**: Hybrid system
- Keepers' Guild handles enforcement
- Serious crimes (murder, major theft) go to Congress tribunal
- Crown technically has jurisdiction but rarely exercises it
- Pattern crimes: Contested—guilds resist Warden authority

**Foreign affairs**: Guild Master General
- Treaties with Crown, other regions
- Trade agreements
- War decisions (rare; guilds prefer commerce to conflict)

- Bound to master for 5-7 years
- Room, board, training provided
- No wage (small allowance)
- Cannot marry, own property, or leave without permission
- Must pass examination to advance

**Journeyman** (Legény):
- Completed apprenticeship
- Can work for wages
- Must travel (the "journeyman years") for 2-5 years
- Can marry with guild permission
- Cannot open own shop or take apprentices

**Master** (Mester):

- Senior masters elected by peers
- Sit on guild council
- Make policy for their trade
- Serve as judges in guild courts

**Guild Master** (Céhmester):
- Elected head of individual guild
- Represents guild in Congress (Great Guilds)
- Substantial power within trade

### Guild Membership and Pattern

**The Key Difference from Heartlands**:

In Fonváros, your pattern determines your opportunities. In Öntőváros, your guild membership modifies how your pattern affects you.

**Guild protections**:
- Pattern-constrained guild members have better outcomes than pattern-constrained non-members
- Guild provides housing, healthcare, burial, family support
- Pattern discrimination in guild matters officially prohibited
- Practical reality: Pattern-privileged still advance faster, but floor is higher

**The Guild Pattern House**:
- Öntőváros has its own Loom node
- Controlled by Clerks' Guild, not Concordat
- Pattern readings done but less determinative
- Guild membership recorded alongside pattern
- "Guild-modified predictions" factor in trade affiliation

**Tensions**:
- Crown wants standard Loom authority
- Orthodox want Concordat control of Pattern House
- Guilds resist external pattern-authority fiercely
- Result: Uneasy compromise, periodic conflicts

### Entry and Advancement

**Becoming an Apprentice**:
- Family connections help (sons of masters preferred)
- Pattern reading submitted but not determinative
- Examination of aptitude
- Fee payment (or guild scholarship for promising candidates)
- Binding ceremony (legally enforceable indenture)

**Becoming a Journeyman**:
- Complete apprenticeship term
- Pass trade examination
- Receive journeyman papers
- Begin mandatory travel (with letters of introduction)

**Becoming a Master**:
- Complete journeyman years
- Return to home guild or petition new one
- Create masterwork (judged by guild elders)
- Pay substantial fees (often years of savings)
- Swear master's oath

**Blocked Advancement**:
- Pattern can't block advancement officially
- But masters choose apprentices (bias operates)
- Masterwork judging is subjective (bias operates)
- Fee requirements screen out poor candidates
- Result: System more open than Heartlands, but not equal

## Economy

### Industrial Output

Öntőváros produces:

**Metals and Metalwork**:
- Cast bronze, iron, steel
- Tools and implements
- Weapons (controversial—guild debate)
- Precision instruments
- Decorative metalwork

**Machinery**:
- Water-powered mechanisms
- Clockwork devices
- Loom components (ironic—they make the machines that predict their fates)
- Industrial equipment

**Textiles**:
- Wool and linen cloth
- Finished clothing
- Specialized fabrics (waterproof, fireproof)
- Guild uniforms (major business)

**Chemicals**:
- Refined Residue (substantial operation)
- Dyes and pigments
- Medicines and compounds
- Industrial chemicals

**Homunculi**:
- The Shapers' Guild produces construct labor
- Military contracts (controversial)
- Specialized workers for dangerous conditions
- Highest quality in Hálcova (arguably)

**Ships and Vehicles**:
- River vessels
- Carts and carriages
- Specialized transport

### Trade Relationships

**With Heartlands**:
- Finished goods flow south
- Raw materials flow north
- Residue trade both directions
- Political tension doesn't stop commerce

**With Shattered Reaches**:
- Maritime equipment
- Metal goods for ships
- Reaches provide certain raw materials, exotic goods

**With Middle Waters**:
- Growing market for manufactured goods
- Colonial raw materials
- Complicated by colonial politics

**With Far Shelf**:
- Ancient Residue purchases
- Equipment for extraction operations
- Limited but valuable trade

### Currency

**Guild Marks** (Céhmárka):
- Guild-issued currency
- Backed by guild reserves
- Trades at slight premium to Crown marks (1.05-1.10:1)
- Preferred within Vent Lands

**Crown Marks**:
- Accepted but not preferred
- Required for dealing with Foreigners' Quarter
- Some guilds refuse them

**Guild Scrip**:
- Individual guild currencies for internal use
- Redeemable for Guild Marks at guild banks
- Workers often paid in scrip (captive spending)

### Wages and Prices

**Compared to Fonváros** (baseline 1.0):
- Cost of living: 0.9× (guild subsidies lower prices)
- Wages: 1.1-1.3× (guild minimums enforced)
- Result: Better standard of living for guild members

**Non-members** pay full prices without wage benefits—strong incentive for guild affiliation.

---

## Religion and the Loom

### Orthodox Presence

**Reduced but present**:
- Temples exist but under guild patronage
- Priests serve guild communities
- Orthodox doctrine taught but guild loyalty primary
- No Concordat authority over Pattern House

**Guild Temples**:
- Each Great Guild maintains a temple
- Dedicated to patron aspects of the Weaver
- Masters fund construction and maintenance
- Services incorporate guild ceremonies

### The Pattern House

**Guild-Controlled Loom Node**:

The Clerks' Guild operates Öntőváros's Loom connection:
- Smaller than Fonváros node
- Same technology, different governance
- Pattern readings performed but interpreted differently

**"Guild-Modified Predictions"**:
- Standard Loom output plus guild membership data
- Predictions factor in guild protections and constraints
- Result: Less deterministic than pure pattern reading
- Controversial—Orthodox say it corrupts the Weaver's design

**What This Means Practically**:
- Pattern-constrained guild member: Better predictions than same pattern in Heartlands
- Pattern-privileged non-member: Worse predictions than same pattern in Heartlands
- System explicitly values guild membership as pattern-modifier

### Heterodox Movements

**Threadism**: Popular among educated guild members
- Idea that fate can be rewoven fits guild ethos
- "We reshape metal; why not destiny?"
- Tolerated, sometimes openly practiced

**Fleshwright Heresy**: Strong in Shapers' Guild
- Materialist view that fate is just biology
- Their daily work involves building life without pattern
- Officially suppressed, practically widespread

**Labor Spirituality**: Emerging movement
- Work itself as sacred
- Guild brotherhood as religious community
- Orthodox worried, guilds ambivalent

---

## The Shapers' Guild

### Special Status

The **Shapers' Guild** (Formálócéh) occupies unique position:

**Only licensed Flesh Shapers in Vent Lands** must be guild members
- Monopoly on homunculus production
- Monopoly on flesh-modification
- Monopoly on healing services (magical)

**Regulated differently**:
- More intensive oversight
- Blood-sourcing rules strictly enforced
- Homunculus registration required
- Military contracts require Congress approval

### The Shaping Halls

**Where homunculi are made**:
- Large facilities in Workshop City
- Organized production (not individual craftsmen)
- Specialization by type (labor, combat, precision, etc.)
- Quality control systems

**Blood Supply**:
- Guild maintains licensed blood-houses
- Workers sell blood for guild scrip
- Conditions better than Heartlands equivalents (guild regulation)
- Still exploitative, but regulated exploitation

### Homunculus Labor

**Significant economic factor**:
- Homunculi perform dangerous, repetitive, or skilled work
- Foundry work, mining support, cargo handling
- Some precision tasks (steady hands, no fatigue)
- Estimated 15,000 active homunculi in city

**Labor Politics**:
- Human workers sometimes protest homunculus competition
- Guilds balance—homunculi profitable but worker unrest costly
- Carriers' Guild has banned homunculus members
- Other guilds have quotas

## Comparison: Fonváros vs. Öntőväros

| Aspect | Fonváros | Öntőváros |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Population | 250,000 | 180,000 |
| Governance | Crown + Concordat | Guild Congress |
| Pattern authority | Concordat (full) | Guild-controlled (modified) |
| Primary economy | Administration, trade | Manufacturing, production |
| Class determinant | Pattern | Guild rank (pattern secondary) |
| Law enforcement | City Watch + Wardens | Keepers' Guild |
| Social mobility | Very limited | Limited but more pathways |
| Religion | Orthodox dominant | Orthodox present, less powerful |
| Foreign presence | Embassies, trade | Trade factors, minimal official |
| Current crisis | Succession | Shaper scandal |

---

## Summary

Öntőváros represents an alternative model:
- **Guild power** instead of Crown authority
- **Production** instead of administration
- **Modified fate** instead of pure pattern determinism
- **Collective identity** instead of individual classification

It's not a utopia—guild hierarchy can be as rigid as pattern hierarchy, and those outside the system fare poorly. But it demonstrates that Hálcova's fate-based society isn't monolithic. Different structures are possible. Different compromises with the Loom exist.

The question haunting Öntőváros: Can guild autonomy survive if the Crown, the Concordat, and the Warden Order all want it ended? And what happens to the workers if their protectors fall?
