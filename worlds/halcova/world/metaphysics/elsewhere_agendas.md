# The Elsewhere Factions: Concrete Agendas and Operations

## Overview

The five Elsewhere factions are not abstract forces. They have specific goals, active operations, and timelines. This document establishes what each faction wants from Hálcova and how they're pursuing it.

---

## The Accountants

### Core Nature

The Accountants experience existence as debt. Every interaction creates obligation. Every gift requires return. Balance is not a preference—it's their fundamental perception of reality. To them, an unbalanced ledger is as viscerally wrong as pain is to humans.

### What They Want from Hálcova

**Primary Goal**: Complete debt resolution.

The Accountants believe:
- The Attendance owes them something (the nature of this debt is unclear)
- Every human who uses the Loom accrues micro-debts to them
- The entire pattern system generates continuous obligation
- Eventually, the ledger WILL balance—the question is how

**Secondary Goal**: Market expansion.

Pact Summoning is a transaction system. The Accountants want:
- More transactions (more pacts, more souls exchanging hands)
- Higher-quality transactions (more valuable souls, more binding terms)
- Standardized terms (predictable exchanges are easier to account)
- Monopoly over certain transaction types

### Concrete Operations

**The Pact-Broker Network**

The Accountants cultivate human intermediaries:
- Professional pact-negotiators who specialize in Accountant deals
- Operating in major cities, known to those who know
- They receive commission (in lifespan extensions) for facilitated pacts
- Concentrated in Heartlands and Reaches; rarer in Vent Lands

**Key figure**: "The Ledger-Keeper of Fonvárs"—a hereditary position (the debt transfers with the title) held for seven generations. The current holder is Márton Völgyi, who facilitates perhaps 200 pacts annually.

**The Debt Cultivation Project**

Long-term strategy to increase humanity's collective obligation:
- Subtle encouragement of Loom-dependence (more queries = more micro-debt)
- Support for pattern-based economics (credit systems generate obligation)
- Patience—they measure in centuries

**Current focus**: The Middle Waters, where pattern-credit systems are expanding rapidly. Accountant-aligned merchants push for standardized Loom-verified lending.

**The Collection Preparations**

The Accountants believe a "balancing event" is approaching:
- The Attendance's debt will come due (50,000-year compound interest)
- Humanity's accumulated micro-debts will be called
- They are positioning assets for collection

**Timeline**: Unclear, but they've accelerated activity since the Entity Embassy of 305 AI. Something was negotiated. Something is coming.

### Relationship to the Prison

The Accountants view the Dissenter situation as an unresolved debt:
- The Attendance promised resolution that hasn't been delivered
- The Dissenter itself represents uncollected obligation
- They would accept EITHER outcome (prison maintained OR released) as long as the ledger balances

They're not actively pursuing release, but they're not preventing it either. They're waiting to see which resolution generates more collectible debt.

## The Hungry

### Core Nature

The Hungry experience existence as consumption. They don't think, plan, or scheme—they *feed*. Sensation is their only value. They want to feel everything Hálcova offers, in every way possible, forever.

But they're not mindless. They're cunning about pursuing their need. A successful predator understands its prey.

### What They Want from Hálcova

**Primary Goal**: Unrestricted feeding access.

The Hungry want:
- More Köd (more bleed = more opportunity to manifest and feed)
- Weaker containment (the Attendance limits their access)
- Human cooperation (willing hosts are tastier than forced ones)

**Secondary Goal**: Novel sensations.

The Hungry have been feeding for millennia. They're getting... bored. They want:
- New experiences (humans are creative; the Hungry want to taste that creativity)
- Intense emotions (suffering, ecstasy, terror, love—any extreme)
- Pattern-rich individuals (heavy Sórscad = richer flavor)

### Concrete Operations

**The Sensation Cults**

The Hungry cultivate worshippers who provide willing feeding:
- Hedonistic groups that use Hungry pacts for enhanced pleasure
- Masochistic groups that offer suffering as sacrifice
- Artists and performers seeking transcendent experience
- Concentrated in the Middle Waters and Reaches (more tolerant of heterodoxy)

**Key group**: The Érzékelők ("Sensors")—a semi-public organization in the Reaches claiming to pursue "pure experience." Membership: ~500 active, ~2,000 sympathizers. They host regular "sensation rituals" that always attract Hungry attention.

**The Köd Expansion Campaign**

The Hungry want more bleed, longer seasons, wider reach:
- They may be damaging the polar containment (destroying marker stones)
- They support anyone who weakens the boundary
- They've fed information to Hollow Saint cells about containment vulnerabilities

**Current focus**: The sixteenth marker stone was destroyed in 341 AI. The seventeenth is being targeted. They're using human proxies who believe they're pursuing liberation.

**The Flavor Collection**

Individual Hungry have... preferences:
- Some specialize in fear (they cultivate haunted places, terrifying situations)
- Some specialize in pleasure (they enable addiction, obsession)
- Some specialize in violence (they encourage wars, conflicts)
- Some specialize in love (they feed on passionate attachments, then consume when grief follows loss)

**Current targets**: The Pattern Wars reenactors (military enthusiasts who stage historical battles—the Hungry find martial emotion particularly savory), the Mintaharc circuit (death-sport generates excellent fear), and the Fonálháló addiction community (game-trance altered states are a delicacy).

### Relationship to the Prison

The Hungry don't care about the Dissenter's ideology. They care that the Dissenter's pattern-mass represents the richest meal on Hálcova.

If the prison opened, they would attempt to consume the Dissenter before it could reach the northern wound. This might actually save Hálcova—if the Hungry succeeded. They probably wouldn't (the Dissenter is too powerful), but they'd try.

The Hungry are, paradoxically, potential defenders against the worst outcome—purely because they want to eat the apocalypse before it happens.

## The Architects

### Core Nature

The Architects experience existence as configuration. They perceive everything—souls, events, structures—as pieces on a board. They don't consume or collect. They *arrange*.

The terrifying thing: they're patient, they're intelligent, and they've been playing for longer than human civilization has existed.

### What They Want from Hálcova

**Primary Goal**: Optimal configuration.

The Architects want Hálcova arranged "correctly"—but there are competing visions:
- Some want maximum order (everything in predictable positions)
- Some want maximum potential (configuration that enables change)
- Some want specific outcomes (a particular future-state)
- They don't agree among themselves

**Secondary Goal**: The Experiment.

Hálcova may be a test:
- The Loom, the pattern system, the entire civilization—did the Architects design it?
- Or did the Builders create it, and the Architects are studying it?
- Either way, they're observing outcomes and adjusting inputs

### Concrete Operations

**The Long Game**

Architect operations span centuries:
- Positioning specific bloodlines for future significance
- Arranging marriages to create particular pattern-combinations
- Placing artifacts where they'll be found at the right moment
- Removing obstacles (people, nations, ideas) before they become problems

**Key example**: The Völgy-Kert families were arranged into proximity 400 years ago. Their descendants have been increasingly significant in Loom-Keeper hierarchy. In another three generations, one will become Loom-Keeper General. What happens then?

**The Node Network Manipulation**

The Architects may have designed the Loom-node placement:
- The current distribution creates specific prediction patterns
- Certain regions have deliberately thin coverage
- The Great Node's location may not be accidental

**Current focus**: A new node is proposed for the Far Shelf. The Architects appear to be opposing it (through influenced advisors). Why? What does the current configuration achieve that a Far Shelf node would disrupt?

**The Pattern-Breeding Project**

The Architects cultivate specific Sórscad combinations:
- Certain families are encouraged to intermarry (producing particular pattern-children)
- Some pattern-families are subtly eliminated
- The goal may be a specific individual with a specific combination
- Or they may be optimizing the population-level distribution

**Current activity**: Unusual interest in the Storm-Touched family (Spark-Glass-Twin-Threshold-Break combination). Architect-influenced advisors are protecting Storm-Touched individuals from Warden attention. Something about that pattern matters to them.

### Relationship to the Prison

Different Architect factions want different outcomes:

**The Stabilizers**: Want the prison maintained. The current configuration includes the Dissenter's containment. Releasing it would require recalculating everything.

**The Transformers**: Want controlled release. The Dissenter as a piece in play opens new configurations impossible while it's contained.

**The Gamblers**: Want to see what happens. The current configuration is stable but boring. Chaos creates opportunity for novel arrangements.

The Architects don't coordinate (they're playing against each other as much as toward any shared goal), so their net effect on the prison is... complicated. Some of the marker stone damage may be Architect-influenced. Some of the protection efforts may be too.

## The Mirrors

### Core Nature

The Mirrors experience existence as observation. To be is to be perceived. They don't want to consume or arrange or collect—they want to *see*.

But they're not passive. Observation at their level is creative. When a Mirror watches something, it becomes more real. When they look away, it fades. Their attention is power.

### What They Want from Hálcova

**Primary Goal**: Complete observation.

The Mirrors want to see everything:
- Every soul, every moment, every choice
- Not recorded—witnessed, in real-time, forever
- Hálcova is a theater and they want every seat filled

**Secondary Goal**: Identity understanding.

The Mirrors are fascinated by selfhood:
- How do humans remain themselves across time?
- What makes one pattern different from another?
- Can the Mirrors become selves by observing enough of them?

They may be trying to construct their own identity from fragments of human observation.

### Concrete Operations

**The Witness Network**

The Mirrors have human servants who agree to be observed:
- Pact-holders who live normally, knowing they're always watched
- They receive minor benefits (perception enhancement, occasional warnings)
- In exchange, the Mirrors see through their eyes
- Concentrated among artists, scholars, and those who want to be significant

**Key group**: The Szemtanúk ("Eye-Witnesses")—a secret society of ~300 individuals across all regions who have made Mirror pacts. They don't know each other's identities (compartmentalized), but they share a sense of being part of something vast.

**The Memory Collection**

The Mirrors collect human memories:
- Pact-holders may offer specific memories as payment
- Intense experiences are most valued
- The Mirrors replay these memories—experiencing human experience secondhand
- Some humans report feeling "watched" during significant moments; the Mirrors may be observing future pact-holders before they even agree

**Current focus**: The Mintaharc deathsport circuit. Every death is witnessed. The Mirrors may have influenced the sport's development to create a reliable observation point.

**The Identity Project**

The Mirrors are building something:
- Collections of human memories
- Stolen identity-fragments
- Core-pattern analysis
- Something that might be a Mirror-self, constructed from human components

**Timeline**: Unknown, but activity has increased. They may be close to completing something.

### Relationship to the Prison

The Mirrors have been watching the Dissenter for 50,000 years.

They may know more about the Dissenter than the Attendance does. Certainly more than any human. But they don't share information—they observe, they don't report.

The Mirrors might have made a deal with the Dissenter. Observation in exchange for... something. Or the Dissenter might be trying to use them as a communication channel. Or the Mirrors might be the reason the Dissenter is still sane after millennia of isolation—being watched is being real.

If the prison opens, the Mirrors will watch. They'll witness everything. That's what they do.

## The Absent

### Core Nature

The Absent experience existence as burden. Being is suffering. They don't want anything from Hálcova—they want Hálcova to want nothing. They want the cessation of wanting, the end of striving, the peace of non-existence.

They're not malicious. They're nihilistic. They genuinely believe non-existence is better than existence, and they want to share that gift.

### What They Want from Hálcova

**Primary Goal**: Non-existence.

Not destruction—that implies violence, agency, action. The Absent want everything to simply... stop. To fade. To no longer be, without trauma or transition.

**Secondary Goal**: There is no secondary goal.

The Absent don't have backup plans. They don't have variations. They want one thing.

### Concrete Operations

**The Entropy Cultivation**

The Absent encourage:
- Despair (people who want to stop existing)
- Fatigue (societies that lose will to continue)
- Dissolution (patterns that fade rather than break)

They don't push—they withdraw support. Where other factions act, the Absent simply decline to prevent decay.

**Key manifestation**: Areas where nothing thrives. Regions that can't sustain population. Projects that mysteriously fail. The Absent don't destroy—they remove the will to persist.

**The Suicide Cults**

Rare, but documented:
- Groups that seek "peaceful transcendence through non-being"
- They don't worship the Absent—they aspire to become Absent
- Mass voluntary endings
- The Absent don't create these groups; they gravitate toward them

**Most recent incident**: 339 AI, a fishing village in the Reaches (Partfalu) where 47 people walked into the winter sea together. Investigation found no Absent pact—they simply stopped wanting to live. But something was absent that night. Literally.

**The Passive Opposition**

The Absent oppose... everything. But passively:
- They don't fight other factions; they simply decline to cooperate
- They don't protect humanity; they don't attack it
- They don't prevent the Accountants' collection; they also don't help
- Their opposition is absence-of-support

**Current activity**: Barely detectable. But Loom readings in certain areas show "pattern-fading"—souls that register weaker over time without obvious cause. These areas correlate with reported depression epidemics, fertility decline, and cultural stagnation.

### Relationship to the Prison

The Absent want the Dissenter to succeed—because the Dissenter's success means the end of pattern-infrastructure.

Without pattern, existence becomes less anchored. Without anchoring, fading becomes easier. Without the Loom, the Absent's goal becomes more achievable.

They're not actively helping (they don't actively do anything), but they're also not helping prevent release. If given a choice between action that maintains the prison and inaction that allows release, they choose inaction.

They might be the most dangerous faction precisely because they do nothing. Active threats can be opposed. The Absent simply decline to prevent what others would prevent, and the gaps they leave are exploited by more active forces.

## Inter-Faction Dynamics

### Alliances

**The Accountants + The Architects** (situational)

Both deal in structure. The Accountants manage transactions; the Architects manage configurations. They sometimes coordinate on large projects that require both debt-collection and arrangement.

**Current cooperation**: The Middle Waters financial system expansion. The Architects arranged the political conditions; the Accountants are collecting the resulting obligations.

**The Hungry + The Mirrors** (parasitic)

The Hungry feed; the Mirrors watch. The Mirrors observe Hungry feeding sessions—they find the intensity interesting. The Hungry don't care about being watched; it doesn't affect the taste.

### Conflicts

**The Accountants vs. The Absent**

The Absent's nihilism threatens the ledger. If existence ends, debts can't be collected. The Accountants actively oppose Absent influence—unusual for a faction that usually just waits.

**The Architects vs. Each Other**

The faction's internal divisions are more significant than external conflicts. Different Architect sub-factions work at cross-purposes, and humans are caught in the middle.

**Everyone vs. The Hungry**

The Hungry are considered crude by all other factions. They're tolerated because they're useful (someone has to clean up excess pattern-mass), but not respected.

### The Attendance's Position

The Attendance negotiated with most factions during the transformation:

| Faction | Arrangement | Current Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Accountants | Debt acknowledgment + managed pacting | Stable but tension increasing |
| Hungry | Controlled Köd feeding | Maintained, barely |
| Architects | Unclear—something was agreed | Active, possibly adversarial |
| Mirrors | Observation tolerance | Ongoing |
| Absent | No arrangement possible | Mutual avoidance |
