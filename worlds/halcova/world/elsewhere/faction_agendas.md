# The Elsewhere Factions: Concrete Agendas

## Overview

The five Elsewhere factions have been described in abstract terms. This document commits to specific, concrete goals and plans for each faction—what they want from Hálcova and what they're doing to get it.

---

## The Accountants

### Abstract Nature
Order, balance, debt, obligation. They experience reality as a ledger that must balance.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: The Great Settling**

The Accountants believe that existence itself has a debt structure. Every being that exists has incurred a debt simply by existing—a debt owed to the substrate of reality that allows them to be.

On Hálcova specifically, they want:
- **Pattern-debt collection**: Every pattern represents borrowed order. When patterns end (death), the debt should be collected—not by burning Residue for warmth, but by returning the pattern-energy to the cosmic balance
- **The Attendance's debt**: The Builders transformed themselves using borrowed reality-structure. This debt has compounded for 50,000 years. The Accountants want payment.
- **The Loom as collection mechanism**: The Loom already tracks patterns. The Accountants want to convert it into a debt-collection system.

**Specific Plans:**

1. **Cultivate debtors**: Through pacts, they create individuals who owe them directly. Each pact adds to their claim on Hálcova's pattern-substrate.

2. **Undermine Residue-burning**: Every time Residue is burned for warmth instead of returned to balance, the cosmic debt grows. They subtly encourage practices that waste Residue or prevent its use.

3. **Recruit Loom-Keepers**: Senior Accountant-touched Keepers are repositioned within the Concordat to eventually turn the Loom toward "proper accounting."

4. **Wait for the prison to fail**: When the Dissenter escapes and conflicts with the Attendance, the resulting chaos will create an opening to restructure Hálcova's pattern-economy.

**Timeline**: The Accountants think in millennia. They're patient. But they've noticed the prison degrading and are preparing to act within the next few centuries.

**Current Operations:**
- 3-5 senior Loom-Keepers are Accountant-aligned (unknowingly serving their agenda)
- A merchant guild in the Reaches has been converted into a debt-cult
- They've been carefully documenting the Attendance's "debts" for eventual collection
- Subtle manipulation of Residue markets to increase waste

## The Hungry

### Abstract Nature
Sensation, consumption, experience. They experience reality through consuming it.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: The Feast**

The Hungry want to consume Hálcova—not destroy it, but *experience* it by taking it into themselves. They've been denied full access by the Attendance's boundary maintenance. They want in.

Specifically:
- **More Köd**: Extend and intensify the Elsewhere bleed. The current arrangement lets them feed, but only partially. They want the boundary permanently weakened.
- **Physical anchors**: Currently they can only manifest temporarily during Köd. They want permanent bodies/vessels on Hálcova.
- **Sensation access**: They want to experience mortal sensation—taste, touch, pain, pleasure—through possession or permanent incarnation.

**Specific Plans:**

1. **The Incarnation Project**: Working through Colony Hosts and Pact Summoners to create bodies that can sustain Hungry presence permanently. Several experimental vessels have been created; none have lasted more than a few months.

2. **Köd Extension**: Manipulating pattern-flows to lengthen Köd seasons. Over the past century, Köd has grown ~5% longer. This is their doing.

3. **The Sensation Cult**: In the Middle Waters, a secret society offers "communion with the divine" through possession experiences. The Hungry use these willing hosts to taste mortality.

4. **Undermining the Attendance**: The boundary is maintained partly by the Attendance's vigilance. The Hungry feed information to Hollow Saints to keep the Attendance distracted.

**Timeline**: Immediate and ongoing. The Hungry don't plan in millennia; they want satisfaction now. But they've learned patience through repeated failure.

**Current Operations:**
- The Sensation Cult has ~500 members across Middle Waters and coastal Reaches
- 2-3 experimental permanent vessels are being developed in secret locations
- Active collaboration with certain Colony Hosts who find the arrangement mutually beneficial
- Regular presence during Köd, pushing boundaries of what's permitted

## The Architects

### Abstract Nature
Structure, change, arrangement. They experience reality as a construction project.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: The Redesign**

The Architects don't want to destroy Hálcova or consume it. They want to *rebuild* it according to better principles. They see the current reality-structure as flawed, inefficient, and ugly.

Specifically:
- **Pattern restructuring**: The current pattern-system is, to them, a crude hack. They want to redesign how patterns work.
- **Loom replacement**: The Loom is a primitive tool. They want to replace it with something more elegant.
- **Reality optimization**: They have plans for how matter, energy, and consciousness should be organized. Hálcova is a test case.

**Specific Plans:**

1. **The Templates**: They've been sharing "improved" patterns with select practitioners—alternative ways of structuring magic that are more elegant but require reality-changes to fully implement. These templates spread slowly through practitioner communities.

2. **Infrastructure Preparation**: Through influenced architects (literal building designers), they've been encoding reality-manipulation geometries into physical structures. Certain buildings, if activated, would begin local reality-restructuring.

3. **The Replacement Loom**: In a pocket dimension accessible only during Köd, they're constructing a replacement pattern-processing system. When complete, it could theoretically supplant the existing Loom.

4. **The Attendance Negotiation**: Unlike other factions, the Architects have approached the Attendance with proposals. The Attendance has refused, but the Architects consider this a negotiation in progress.

**Timeline**: The Architects think in terms of project phases. Current phase: preparation. Next phase: implementation. They estimate another 500-1,000 years of preparation.

**Current Operations:**
- ~20 "template practitioners" are experimenting with Architect-designed magic
- 4-5 major buildings contain embedded restructuring geometries (inactive)
- The replacement Loom is ~15% complete
- Ongoing diplomatic contact with the Attendance (through Köd intermediaries)

## The Mirrors

### Abstract Nature
Identity, observation, reflection. They experience reality by reflecting and recording it.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: The Complete Record**

The Mirrors want to observe and record everything. Not to use the information—just to have it. They're building a perfect mirror of reality.

Specifically:
- **Complete observation**: Every event, every thought, every pattern-shift recorded
- **Identity collection**: Copies of every consciousness that has existed or will exist
- **The Mirror-World**: A reflection-dimension where everything is preserved as it was

**Specific Plans:**

1. **The Observer Network**: Through Fate Threaders and certain Loom-Keepers, they've established observation points throughout Hálcova. Information flows to them constantly.

2. **Identity Harvesting**: When people die, the Mirrors attempt to capture a copy of their pattern before it degrades. They've preserved millions of pattern-copies over millennia.

3. **The Mirror Expansion**: Their reflection-dimension grows as they record more. It now contains a near-complete copy of Hálcova's history.

4. **The Long Game**: The Mirrors believe that eventually reality will end. Their mirror-world will persist as the only record of what existed. They're building an ark.

**Timeline**: Infinite. The Mirrors don't have deadlines; they just continue recording.

**Current Operations:**
- Observer network covers ~70% of significant events in Hálcova
- Pattern-harvesting operation runs automatically at death sites
- The mirror-world contains records back to the Transformation
- No active intervention in events (observation only)

**Unique Status:**

The Mirrors are the least threatening faction because they don't want to change anything. They just want to watch. The Attendance tolerates them more than other factions because:
- They don't try to break the boundary
- They don't consume patterns
- They don't restructure reality
- They just... observe

This makes them useful as intermediaries and information sources.

## The Absent

### Abstract Nature
Non-existence, negation, the void. They experience reality as an error to be corrected.

### Concrete Goals

**Primary Goal: Cessation**

The Absent want everything to stop existing. Not destruction (which creates debris)—*cessation*. Reality should return to the void from which it emerged.

Specifically:
- **The Hálcovan Quieting**: End all patterns, all life, all existence on this world
- **The Loom Silencing**: The Loom perpetuates patterns. It must be silenced.
- **The Attendance Dissolution**: The uploaded Builders are existence persisting past death. This is an affront.
- **Universal Quieting**: Hálcova is one world. Eventually, everything must cease.

**Specific Plans:**

1. **The Entropy Acceleration**: Subtle interventions that increase disorder, death, and decay. Make the world run down faster.

2. **The Despair Cultivation**: Through dreams and indirect influence, spread nihilism and the desire for ending. Create mortals who want what the Absent want.

3. **The Pattern Unraveling**: Specific techniques that cause patterns to degrade faster than normal. Spread through certain practitioner circles as "efficient" methods.

4. **The Prison Interest**: The Absent have noticed the southern prison. They don't want to free the Dissenter—they want both the Dissenter and the Attendance to destroy each other, creating an opening for universal cessation.

**Timeline**: The Absent experience time as suffering that should end. Every moment of continued existence is intolerable. They're desperate, but existence is stubborn.

**Current Operations:**
- Nihilistic philosophy spreading through certain intellectual circles
- "Efficiency" techniques that accelerate pattern-degradation in limited use
- Dreams of cessation sent to vulnerable individuals
- Monitoring the southern prison for opportunities
- Active conflict with all other factions (they oppose existence itself)

**Unique Status:**

The Absent are the only faction that all others oppose:
- The Attendance obviously opposes cessation
- The Accountants want debts paid, not erased
- The Hungry want to consume, not cease
- The Architects want to rebuild, not end
- The Mirrors want to record, not witness ending

This makes the Absent isolated but also unpredictable. They'll ally with anyone temporarily if it advances cessation.

## Faction Interactions

### Alliances and Conflicts

| | Accountants | Hungry | Architects | Mirrors | Absent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Accountants** | — | Temporary | Opposed | Neutral | Opposed |
| **Hungry** | Temporary | — | Neutral | Neutral | Opposed |
| **Architects** | Opposed | Neutral | — | Cooperative | Opposed |
| **Mirrors** | Neutral | Neutral | Cooperative | — | Opposed |
| **Absent** | Opposed | Opposed | Opposed | Opposed | — |

**Key Relationships:**

- **Architects + Mirrors**: Share information; both want orderly outcomes
- **Accountants + Hungry**: Sometimes trade favors; both want the boundary weakened
- **Everyone vs. Absent**: Universal opposition to cessation

### The Attendance's Position

The Attendance maintains détente with most factions by:
- Allowing limited Köd feeding (satisfies Hungry partially)
- Tolerating observation (costs nothing to let Mirrors watch)
- Negotiating with Architects (keeps them from forcing changes)
- Paying installments to Accountants (through pact frameworks)
- Actively opposing the Absent (containment, not elimination)

This balance has held for millennia but is straining.

- The Sensation Cult is discovered; what happens to the members?
- Köd extends dangerously, nearly permanently breaching the boundary

### Architects
- A building activates its embedded geometries; local reality begins changing
- An Architect makes direct contact, offering a "deal"
- A practitioner's template-magic begins rewriting their students

### Mirrors
- Someone discovers the Mirror-world and their own copy within it
- The Mirrors reveal information they shouldn't share—why?
- A Mirror-touched individual begins living their copy's life instead

### Absent
- A nihilistic philosophy spreads; suicide rates spike
- Someone develops a technique for true cessation (terrifying)
- The Absent approach the Dissenter with a proposal

## Summary

| Faction | Primary Goal | Current Activity | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Accountants | Collect cosmic debts | Infiltrating institutions, cultivating debtors | Centuries |
| Hungry | Permanent incarnation | Creating vessels, extending Köd | Immediate |
