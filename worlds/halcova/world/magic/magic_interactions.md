# Magic System Interactions: Cross-Art Dynamics

## Overview

The Five Arts do not exist in isolation. When practitioners of different disciplines encounter each other—as competitors, collaborators, or simply as inhabitants of the same world—their powers interact in ways both predictable and horrifying. This document establishes the rules governing those interactions.

---

## Fundamental Principles

### Pattern Interference

Every Art corrupts the practitioner's Sórscad differently:

| Art | Pattern Effect | Circle Most Affected |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| Core Binding | Layering (other patterns bleed in) | Léilcrù |
| Flesh Shaping | Erosion (pattern hollows out) | Húslaimh |
| Pact Summoning | Fading (pattern lightens) | Léilcrù |
| Fate Threading | Narrowing (paths close) | Sórscad |
| Colony Hosting | Hybridization (pattern becomes illegible) | Húslaimh |

When two Arts affect the same circle, they **compete**. The effects don't simply add—they interfere, creating instabilities.

### The Exclusivity Principle

**Hard exclusions**: Some Art combinations are physically impossible.

**Soft exclusions**: Some combinations are possible but create compounding costs.

**Synergies**: Rare combinations that enhance rather than conflict.

## Detailed Interaction Matrix

### Core Binding + Flesh Shaping

**The Question**: Can a Core Binder trap an echo in a homunculus body?

**The Answer**: Yes, but it's an abomination.

**The Process**:
1. Flesh Shaper creates a homunculus with unusual complexity (mimic-grade or higher)
2. Core Binder binds an echo to the homunculus as anchor (instead of inanimate object)
3. The echo animates the homunculus, providing "intelligence" it would otherwise lack

**The Result**: A **Revenant**—a construct that believes it's the dead person it contains.

**The Costs**:
- The homunculus requires both blood-feeding AND pattern-resource upkeep
- Bleed from the echo affects BOTH the binder AND the shaper
- The revenant has the echo's memories but the homunculus's hungers
- It will eventually seek blood from anyone, including its creators
- The Sórscad becomes completely illegible—The Loom cannot track revenants

**Strategic Use**:
- Assassination (the target's loved one, reconstructed and sent home)
- Infiltration (rebuild the dead, insert them into their former life)
- Personal obsession (people who cannot let go, given flesh again)

**Legal Status**: Universally illegal. Revenants are destroyed on sight. Creating one is Pattern-Severance offense.

### Core Binding + Pact Summoning

**The Question**: Can an echo fulfill a pact? Can a pact summoner bind the core of another summoner?

**The Answers**:

**Echo as Pact Payment**: No. Echoes are pattern-fragments, not complete cores. Elsewhere entities want whole patterns—the echo is like paying with counterfeit currency. Entities who accept echo-payment are either desperate or running a scam.

**Binding a Summoner's Core**: Depends on how much remains.
- Heavy summoner (70%+ paid): Core is too thin to bind. Harvesting produces weak or empty echoes.
- Moderate summoner (30-70% paid): Core binds but is unstable. The echo is confused, with gaps where the entity already fed.
- Light summoner (<30% paid): Normal binding, but the echo may still feel the pact. Some report sensing their entity even in death.

**The Horrible Discovery**: If a binder holds an echo that still has pact-debt, the entity may attempt to collect through the binding connection. The binder becomes aware of something watching through their echo.

**Strategic Use**:
- Echo-interrogation of dead summoners (what did they promise? to whom?)
- Entity-detection (binding suspicious corpses to check for pact-traces)
- Very rarely: Using the bound echo as bait to draw out the entity

---

### Core Binding + Fate Threading

**The Question**: Can a threader pull an extracted self from a bound echo? Can you bind the echo of an extracted self?

**The Answers**:

**Threading from an Echo**: Impossible. Echoes are fixed—they represent what someone WAS, not what they might become. No future branches exist to harvest.

**Binding an Extracted Self's Core**: Yes, and it's philosophically disturbing.

When an extracted self dies:
- It leaves a core (it was a real person, briefly)
- The core contains memories of the unlived life
- Binding it creates an echo of someone who never "really" existed

**The Implication**: The binder holds an echo of their own unlived potential. The echo believes it was real. It remembers events that never occurred in the "main" timeline.

**The Paradox**: If the threader later reaches the choice-point the extraction came from, they face a version of themselves they've already met. The fate-branch was supposed to be severed—but the echo remembers it.

**Strategic Use**:
- Self-interrogation (what would I have learned if I'd made that choice?)
- Pattern-recovery (extracted selves carry copies of the threader's original pattern-weight)
- Very rarely: An echo of an extracted self might know things the living threader needs

**The Horror**: Some threaders become addicted to this cycle. Pull selves, let them die, bind their echoes, interrogate them for wisdom, repeat. They end up surrounded by echoes of their own potential, narrowed to a thread but rich in voices.

### Core Binding + Colony Hosting

**The Question**: Can a colony consume an echo? Can you bind the core of a colony host?

**The Answers**:

**Colony Consuming an Echo**: Not directly—echoes aren't physical. But if an echo is manifested (called from its anchor), a colony can attempt to consume the manifestation.

**What Happens**:
- The colony breaks down the ectoplasmic matter
- It gains... something. Not a full pattern, but traces.
- Future fruitings may show echo-influence (shapes, behaviors, fragments of memory)
- The anchor becomes inert. The echo is gone—consumed into the colony's memory-matrix.

This is one of the only ways to permanently destroy an echo outside of Pattern-Severance.

**Binding a Host's Core**: Complex.
- Fresh host (colony small): Normal binding, but the echo smells wrong. Something fungal in it.
- Established host (colony integrated): The core is hybrid. The echo contains host memories AND colony-impressions. It may express behaviors from consumed organisms.
- Ancient host (colony dominant): The "person" and "colony" are indistinguishable. Binding captures both. The echo might fruit.

**The Horror**: Some colony cults deliberately bind their elders, creating echoes that contain centuries of colony-memory. These echoes are oracles—but they're also not quite people anymore.

---

### Flesh Shaping + Pact Summoning

**The Question**: Can you power a homunculus with pact-energy? Can an entity inhabit a construct?

**The Answers**:

**Pact-Powered Homunculi**: Possible, but the entity takes payment in the creator's pattern, not blood. The homunculus still needs blood—it now also needs a piece of you each time it's summoned.

**Why Would Anyone**: The homunculus gains capabilities beyond normal constructs. Entity-touched homunculi can:
- See through Elsewhere-adjacent spaces
- Resist other magical interference
- Deliver pact-messages without the summoner present
- In rare cases, manifest minor entity abilities

**Entity Inhabitation**: Yes, and this is how some summoners survive their debt.

The trick: Create a mimic-grade homunculus. When your debt comes due, the entity consumes you—but you're already "in" the homunculus. Your pattern transfers.

**The Problem**: 
- This only works if the entity accepts the transfer (most don't—they want YOU)
- The homunculus-you isn't quite you. Something was lost in translation.
- You still need blood to survive. But now you're a construct needing blood.
- You've become a revenant without the binding-partner.

**Legal Status**: The homunculus-escape is legend among summoners. No confirmed cases—but rumors persist of ancient Flesh Shaper-Summoners who've existed for centuries in constructed bodies.

### Flesh Shaping + Fate Threading

**The Question**: Can you thread a version of yourself that practiced Flesh Shaping? Can you shape a pulled self?

**The Answers**:

**Threading a Shaper-Self**: Yes. The extraction arrives with:
- All the Shaping knowledge of that path
- The erosion damage to their Húslaimh
- Any homunculi they created (pulled along as part of their fate-bundle)
- The blood-hunger that comes with the practice

**The Problem**: Your main body isn't a Flesh Shaper. You don't have the erosion. The pulled self looks at you—whole, unspent—and might wonder why they should serve someone who took the easy path.

**Shaping a Pulled Self**: Technically possible, but the extracted self is a person with their own will. This is torture, not craft. The Order treats it as Pattern-Interference of the highest order.

**Strategic Use**:
- Need a Flesh Shaper quickly? Pull one of your potential selves who went that route.
- Need homunculi without practicing yourself? Your Shaper-self brought theirs.
- The pulled self pays the blood cost, not you.

**The Horror**: Some threaders pull multiple Shaper-selves, using them up for their constructs, then pulling another when the first is too depleted. They're not harming themselves—just their potential.

### Flesh Shaping + Colony Hosting

**The Question**: Can a colony consume a homunculus? Can you shape infected flesh?

**The Answers**:

**Colony Consuming Homunculus**: Yes, and the colony gains the pattern of whatever the homunculus was made from—plus something else. The spark (the shaper's blood-pattern) becomes part of the colony's memory.

Colonies that have consumed many homunculi become... strange. They start producing fruitings that have craft-echoes. Not true homunculi—fungal constructs that approximate Shaping principles through biological means.

**Shaping Infected Flesh**: This is where the two Arts overlap most naturally.

A Flesh Shaper who hosts a colony can:
- Use colony biomass as construction material
- Create homunculi that are partly fungal
- Fruit constructs that don't require blood-spark (colony provides animation)
- Heal their own erosion damage through colony regeneration

**The Cost**: The colony doesn't distinguish between "you" and "your constructs." Long-term dual practitioners find their homunculi becoming part of the colony network. The constructs start communicating. They remember each other. They might not obey anymore.

**The Synthesis**: The rarest dual practitioners can create **Spore-Constructs**—homunculi seeded with colony spores that can reproduce. Self-propagating servant species.

This is how the Colony Cults gained their original followers. The founders weren't just hosts—they were Shapers who learned to make more hosts.

### Pact Summoning + Fate Threading

**The Question**: Can you pull a self that made a different pact? Can an entity claim a pulled self?

**The Answers**:

**Threading Alternate-Pact Selves**: Yes, and this is one of the most strategically valuable combinations.

Your pulled self might have:
- Pacted with a different entity than you
- Pacted with the same entity for different terms
- Never pacted at all
- Pacted and already been consumed (pulling a husk)

**The Strategic Gold**: Pulling a self who pacted with your entity's rival. Now you have intelligence on enemy faction operations. Your extraction knows Elsewhere politics from the inside.

**Entity Claiming Extractions**: This gets complicated.

- If YOU have a pact: Your extractions might be covered (they're "you")
- If THEY had a pact: Their debt exists, but their entity can't find them in your timeline
- If BOTH: Welcome to the worst situation—two entities both claim rights to your pattern

Some entities consider extracted selves "bonus payments"—you've created additional copies of yourself for them to feed on. Others consider extractions "theft"—you're diluting the pattern they're owed.

**The Horror**: Pull a self who escaped their pact through some clever trick. Their entity is still looking. When they manifested into your timeline, they became findable again. You've just handed someone over.

---

### Pact Summoning + Colony Hosting

**The Question**: Can an entity feed on a colony? Can a colony consume entity influence?

**The Answers**:

**Entity Feeding on Colony-Hosts**: Entities want pattern. Colony-hosts have hybrid patterns. Most entities find this... unsatisfying. Like eating food that's been mixed with something inedible.

**The Discount**: Colony-hosts can sometimes negotiate better pact terms. Their pattern is "less pure"—worth less on the Elsewhere market. Some hosts deliberately infect themselves before pacting, reducing what they have to offer.

**Colony Consuming Entity-Touched**: When a colony breaks down someone who was heavily pact-bound:
- It gains traces of entity-influence
- Future fruitings might manifest Elsewhere characteristics
- The colony-network starts feeling... watched
- Some fruitings don't decompose properly—they linger, waiting

**The Nightmare Scenario**: A colony that has consumed many pact-bound individuals becomes a bridge. Elsewhere entities can reach through it. The colony is no longer just fungal—it's a door.

Colony cults in regions with high pact-activity sometimes discover this accidentally. Their network becomes partially Elsewhere-native. The fruitings obey, but not only the host.

---

### Fate Threading + Colony Hosting

**The Question**: Can you thread a self that hosted? What does a colony make of extracted selves?

**The Answers**:

**Threading a Host-Self**: You pull the self AND their colony. The infection is part of their fate-bundle.

**The Problem**: Now you have a colony in your environment that isn't part of YOU. It wants to spread. Your non-infected body looks like a great host. Every pulled host-self is a contamination risk.

**Colony Consuming Extractions**: To a colony, an extracted self is just... meat. Pattern-rich meat, but meat.

**The Harvesting Strategy**: Some host-threaders deliberately pull selves to feed their colony. The extraction provides high-pattern biomass. The colony gains the fate-weight of paths the threader didn't take.

Over time, such colonies become fate-sensitive. They can sense narrowing. They know when someone nearby is threading. They're drawn to depleted threaders like sharks to blood.

**The Mutual Consumption**: A host-threader who pulls a host-self creates colony-collision. Two colonies in proximity will compete, merge, or war. The threader becomes the battleground. One colony will win. It won't necessarily be theirs.

---

## Three-Way and Higher Interactions

### The Revenant Host

Core Binding + Flesh Shaping + Colony Hosting

A revenant (homunculus-anchored echo) that becomes colony-infected.

**Result**: The echo's pattern memories merge with colony memory. The fungal network starts "remembering" being a person. The construct-body sprouts. The echo forgets which memories are borrowed, which are consumed, which are its own.

**Why This Exists**: Nobody deliberately creates these. They happen when containment fails—a revenant escapes into colony territory, or a host colony finds a revenant and treats it as food.

**The Horror**: Revenant-hosts are nearly impossible to destroy. The echo can't be severed (the anchor is biological). The colony regenerates damage. The construct doesn't feel pain. They just keep coming.

### The Hollow Bridge

Pact Summoning + Colony Hosting + (time)

A host whose colony has consumed many pact-bound individuals, who then makes their own pact.

**Result**: The pact-entity has direct access to the colony network. Every host in that network becomes partially claimed. The original host is a conduit—their entity can manifest anywhere the colony reaches.

**Why This Happens**: Colony cults sometimes deliberately cultivate this. They worship an Elsewhere faction and want direct access. They build the bridge intentionally.

**The Horror**: The colony spreads. The bridge extends. Every new host is another node the entity can touch. This is how Elsewhere establishes permanent infrastructure in Hálcova.

### The Threaded Binder's Archive

Core Binding + Fate Threading + (patience)

A threader who pulls selves and then binds their echoes when they die.

**Result**: A collection of echoes of potential selves. Each one remembers a life the threader didn't live. Together, they contain more knowledge than any single human could accumulate.

**Why Someone Would**: Power. Wisdom. The inability to let go of possibility.

**The Horror**: The threader becomes a council of themselves. Major decisions require consulting the echoes. Eventually, the "main" self is just one voice among many. Who's really running the body? The one that's alive, or the consensus of the dead?

---

## Mutual Exclusions

### Hard Incompatibilities

**Full Colony Hosting + Pact Completion**: When an entity collects your full debt, they want your pattern. Colony-hosts' patterns are hybrid. The entity can't fully collect—but it can't not-collect either. The host exists in a state of perpetual partial-consumption. Alive, but being eaten forever.

**Fate Threading + Pattern-Severance**: A threader who undergoes Pattern-Severance (Warden execution method) has their Sórscad dissolved. This ripples backward, collapsing all their extractions. Every pulled self dies simultaneously. Executing a heavy threader can kill dozens.

**Core Binding + The Absent Faction**: Echoes require pattern to exist. The Absent consume toward non-existence. An echo bound by someone pacted with The Absent slowly dissolves. The Absent are actually *using* binders as pattern-destruction tools.

### Soft Incompatibilities

**Heavy Flesh Shaping + Fate Threading**: The erosion to Húslaimh makes threading harder. Your fate-web is anchored in your physical body. Less body = less anchor = harder to pull.

**Heavy Pact Debt + Core Binding**: Your pattern-light state makes bleed worse. You're already thin—absorbing echo-contamination can overwhelm what remains.

**Multiple Extractions + Colony Hosting**: Each pulled self is an infection vector. Multiple extractions multiply contamination risk. Threaders avoid colonies; hosts avoid threading.

## Synergies

### Flesh Shaping + Colony Hosting (The Spore-Craft)

As noted above, these Arts share a substrate (flesh) and can enhance each other. A Shaper-Host produces better constructs with less personal cost. The colony provides material; the Shaper provides direction.

### Core Binding + Pact Summoning (The Ghost-Market)

Binders can harvest echoes. Entities want patterns. While echoes aren't full payment, they can be traded for information, minor favors, or as "samples" of pattern-quality. Some binders become brokers—introducing entities to suitable pact-candidates in exchange for considerations.

### Fate Threading + Wartime

Threaders in combat can pull soldier-selves at need. Multiple extractions fighting together know each other's moves instinctively. Military threaders are feared—they bring reinforcements from possibility itself.

---

## The Order's Response

The Warden Order monitors cross-Art practice with special attention:

**Revenant Creation**: Pattern-Severance for all involved, destruction of the construct.

**Bridge-Building**: Entire colony networks purged. Scorched-earth doctrine.

**Threaded Archives**: Monitored but not automatically illegal—depends on extraction count and echo stability.

**Spore-Craft**: Regulated, not banned. Guild oversight in Vent Lands; illegal elsewhere.

**Entity-Escape via Homunculus**: If confirmed real, the Order wants to study it. They've never verified a case.
