# City Layouts of Norbela: Compendium Section

## Overview
Norbela’s cities are shaped by arcane punk industry, class stratification, and environmental hazards. Each city’s layout reflects its function, history, and the brutal realities of dark fantasy life. Most cities are tiered or zoned, with the elite and government at the center or highest elevation, industry and commerce in the middle, and the poor, laborers, and pollution at the periphery or lowest points. Major transit lines (rail, skyship towers, arcane carriage roads) connect districts, while entropy dead zones, pollution, and security checkpoints create hard boundaries.

## Standard City Layout Elements
- **Central Core or High Districts**: Seat of government, elite housing, major temples, and arcane research towers. Often walled or elevated, with restricted access.
- **Industrial/Commercial Ring**: Surrounds or radiates from the core. Includes magitech workshops, refineries, markets, guild halls, and merchant housing. Rail stations and skyship towers are usually here or at the edge of the core.
- **Residential Districts**: Middle and lower castes live in concentric rings or descending terraces. Quality drops with distance from the core or elevation.
- **Slums/Undercity**: Lowest elevation or outermost ring. Tenements, stew lines, criminal enclaves, and pipeline yards. Pollution, blackouts, and violence are common.
- **Infrastructure Corridors**: Major pipelines, power conduits, and aqueducts run visibly through all districts, often above ground in poor areas and buried in elite zones.
- **Landmarks**: Each city has unique features—observatories, archives, palaces, or dead zones—anchoring its identity.

## City Layout Principles
- **Verticality**: Power and wealth are literally above the poor; pollution and danger flow downward/outward.
- **Segregation**: Physical barriers (walls, checkpoints, dead zones) enforce class and faction boundaries.
- **Transit Hubs**: Rail, skyship, and major roads connect cities, but access is restricted by caste and wealth.
- **Hazard Zoning**: Industrial accidents, entropy, and pollution are pushed to the margins or lowest points, affecting the vulnerable first.
- **Landmark Anchors**: Each city’s identity is tied to a unique landmark or crisis site.

## Text-to-Image Prompt Writeup

"A dark fantasy arcane punk city, tiered and sprawling. At the highest point or center, grand government towers and elite mansions rise above walled gardens and arcane observatories. Surrounding this core, rings or terraces of magitech workshops, refineries, bustling markets, and guild halls. Rail lines and skyship towers connect districts, with visible pipelines and power conduits snaking through the city. Descending or radiating outward, dense residential blocks give way to sprawling slums, stew lines, and criminal enclaves. The lowest or outermost areas are scarred by pollution, waste pools, and entropy dead zones. Landmarks like fortress-libraries, collapsed refineries, or ancient shrines anchor each city’s identity. The city is divided by walls, checkpoints, and class barriers, with danger and decay concentrated at the margins. The overall mood is oppressive, industrial, and vibrant with magical energy—everywhere, the cost of progress is visible in suffering and ruin. Birds-eye view, highly detailed, moody lighting, blue and brass tones, hints of arcane glow."
