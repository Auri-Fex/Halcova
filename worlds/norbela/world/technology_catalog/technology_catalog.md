- **Products**: Fake healing wands (useless), diluted shyak, faulty prosthetics, defective power cells
- **Prices**: 30-50% below market (appeal to desperate lower caste)
- **Volume**: 10,000+ counterfeit devices/year; 1,000 deaths from failures
- **Impact**: Desperate poor buy cheap; get maimed/killed; Nethvor doesn't care; profit margin 80%

### B. Revolutionary Technology

#### Improvised Explosives
- **Description**: Homemade bombs using stolen shyak; glass bottles, metal casings, crude fuses
- **Function**: Less reliable than military grenades; 40% dud rate; 10% premature detonation
- **Cost**: 5 Shards (materials)
- **Users**: Morshan-Breakers, other revolutionaries, desperate criminals
- **Casualties**: Kill targets but also makers, bystanders; Kalen-Sheloth bombing killed intended 50 + unintended 150

#### Signal Jammers
- **Description**: Crude shyak devices that interfere with resonance stones, voice relays; create "dead zones"
- **Function**: Block Council surveillance/communication; allow covert operations; range 100m
- **Cost**: 50 Shards (homemade)
- **Users**: Revolutionaries coordinate attacks; criminals evade detection
- **Limitation**: Council developing counter-measures; Nethvor sells jammer locations to both sides (profit from both)

#### Arcane Traps
- **Description**: Shyak-triggered mines, tripwires, proximity bombs; hidden in forests, roads, buildings
- **Function**: Defend rebel bases, ambush patrols, deny territory
- **Cost**: 10 Shards (improvised)
- **Users**: Vornalen-Keepers in forests; Morshan-Breakers in cities
- **Casualties**: 200 soldiers/year; also 50 civilians (indiscriminate); revolutionaries accept collateral

## V. Failure Modes & Catastrophes (Consolidated)

### Common Device Failures
1. **Shyak Leak** (30% of failures): Slow poisoning; corruption; mutations; workers/users die over weeks/months
2. **Explosion** (25% of failures): Instant death for user + 5-20m radius depending on device size
3. **Malfunction** (20% of failures): Device stops working; harmless but expensive (replacement cost)
4. **Arcane Feedback** (15% of failures): Energy rebounds into user; burns, brain damage, heart attacks
5. **Catastrophic Cascade** (10% of failures): Device triggers entropy spread; creates dead zone; rare but devastating

### Major Disasters (Historical)
1. **Vorn-Merath Refinery Explosion (1,898)**: Morshan's bombing; 200 dead; refinery destroyed; 5M GS damage; political crisis
2. **Kel-Tavanor Power Plant Meltdown (1,880)**: Reactor failure; 5,000 dead instantly; 100km² dead zone; 50,000 died from cancer over 20 years; still evacuated
3. **Gen-Sorath Skyship Crash (1,895)**: Flotation array failed; crashed into market; 120 dead (80 on ship, 40 on ground); no accountability
4. **Kalen-Sheloth Pipeline Rupture (1,892)**: Sabotage; 50,000 L shyak flooded lower districts; 300 dead from drowning/poisoning; slums toxic for years
5. **Vorn-Velash Train Derailment (1,897)**: Brake failure; 200 dead; rail company blamed workers; executed 5 engineers; continued operations

### Ongoing Crises
- **Daily workplace accidents**: 1-2 deaths/day continent-wide from magitech failures
- **Refinery pollution**: 1,000+ cancers/year; no regulation
- **Groundwater poisoning**: 200 deaths/year; spreading
- **Black market deaths**: 1,000 deaths/year from counterfeit devices
- **Military weapons malfunctions**: 100 soldiers/year killed by own weapons

## VI. Social & Cultural Impact

### Technology as Class Marker
- **Upper Caste**: Newest, safest devices; failures rare; immediate replacements; political connections ensure access
- **Middle Caste**: Older, functional devices; failures common; expensive replacements; limited access to repairs
- **Lower Caste**: Cheap, dangerous devices; failures expected; no replacements; deaths normalized
- **Slaves**: No devices; manual labor only; if given device, it's a weapon (forced to use in combat)

### Technology Addiction
- **Healing Dependency**: Upper castes addicted to healing wands; minor injuries immediately treated; physical weakness from overuse
- **Communication Obsession**: Constant voice relay use; can't function without instant communication; anxiety when devices fail
- **Entertainment Escape**: Phonographs, dream projectors (if available); wealthy escape reality; ignore suffering outside doors

### Resistance to Technology
- **Vornalen-Keepers**: Reject industrial magitech; use minimal traditional magic; view extraction as suicide
- **Religious Opposition**: Faith of First Blood clergy preach against "unnatural devices"; Inquisition burns experimental technology
- **Luddite Movement**: Small groups sabotage factories, destroy devices; hanged as terrorists; 50 executed/year

### Future Technology (In Development)
1. **Shyak Synthesis** (Telumesh researching): Create artificial shyak; eliminate need for extraction; revolutionize world IF successful; currently 0% success rate
2. **Entropy Reversal** (Ancient texts describe): Undo magical decay; save continent; requires massive device + 100,000 L shyak; Council refuses funding
3. **Neural Linking** (Telvor-Shin experimenting): Direct brain-device interface; telepathy, enhanced intelligence; 90% test subjects brain-damaged
4. **Biological Enhancement** (Forbidden research): Inject shyak directly into bodies; create super-soldiers; 99% become monsters; Koresh-Val secretly funding
5. **Dimensional Gates** (Theoretical): Teleportation via entropy manipulation; Ancient texts claim it triggered First Collapse; absolutely forbidden; Nethvor seeking

**All technology in Norbela is double-edged: it enables advancement but accelerates entropy. Every device risks failure. Every innovation brings chaos. And the lower classes pay the highest price for progress they never asked for.**
