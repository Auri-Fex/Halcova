## Thematic Core

### Environmental Collapse

Not background—**the central fact**
- 40% of world dead
- 10% per year expansion
- 10-30 years to extinction
- Everyone knows
- Can't/won't stop

### Class Through Resource Access

**Magic = Life Quality**:
- Pure shyak = elite (live 70+ years)
- Standard shyak = middle (live 50 years)
- Fauxil/slagcells = poor (live 35 years)
- Nothing = dead

### Biological Horror

**Magic Costs Bodies**:
- Creatures harvested (sentient?)
- Workers mutate
- Pollution visible
- Death everywhere

### Industrial Alienation

**Magic Should Be Wondrous**:
- Instead: Commodity
- Instead: Fuel
- Instead: Pollution
- Instead: Doom

## Story Potential

### Plots That Work

**Heists**: Steal rare shyak
**Mysteries**: Who's accelerating collapse?
**Survival**: Navigate dying world
**Rebellion**: Fight extraction system
**Horror**: Mutation and corruption
**Political**: Baron machinations
**Personal**: Ethical choices in crisis

### Plots That Don't

**Tech Solves Everything**: Tech caused this
**Happy Ending**: World is dying
**Simple Good vs Evil**: Everyone complicit
