- Threnok-Gash (Northern) - Conditional support

**Opposition Bloc**:

## Relationships and Alliances

### Closest Allies

**Telumesh** (Archival Baron)
- **Relationship**: Trusted advisor and friend
- **History**: Mentored Shalen-Mor in early political career
- **Dynamic**: Intellectual equals; share vision of knowledge-based solutions
- **Current**: Under siege by Inquisition; Shalen-Mor struggles to protect him
- **Tension**: Telumesh knows forbidden knowledge Shalen-Mor needs but fears

**Telvor-Shin** (Experimental Baron)
- **Relationship**: Necessary ally and frustration
- **History**: Partnered on infrastructure projects
- **Dynamic**: Shalen-Mor provides funding; Telvor provides innovation
- **Current**: Ally but reckless experiments cause political problems
- **Tension**: Telvor's proto-automation threatens labor stability

### Strategic Partnerships

**Threnok-Gash** (Northern Baron)
- **Relationship**: Mercenary ally (bought support)
- **History**: Originally opposed; Shalen-Mor negotiated trade deals
- **Dynamic**: Transactional; Threnok supplies ice-creature oil at favorable terms
- **Current**: Loyalty wavering as Koresh-Val offers more money
- **Risk**: Key vote; defection would collapse Council majority

**Vonder-Shin** (Spiritual Baron)
- **Relationship**: Unpredictable neutral
- **History**: Minimal interaction; Vonder operates independently
- **Dynamic**: Shalen-Mor respects Vonder's visions; fears their implications
- **Current**: Vonder increasingly cryptic about "approaching darkness"
- **Potential**: Could become ally if crisis predictions prove accurate

### Opponents

**Koresh-Val** (Sulenor Extractionist)
- **Relationship**: Primary political enemy
- **History**: Opposed since both entered Council
- **Dynamic**: Fundamentally incompatible worldviews
- **Current**: Open warfare brewing; Koresh pushes for extraction war
- **Danger**: Ruthless, wealthy, growing more desperate and aggressive

**Velasha-Nen** (Eshtor Conservationist)
- **Relationship**: Respectful opposition
- **History**: Worked together on early conservation efforts
- **Dynamic**: Shared concern for ecology; disagree on priorities
- **Current**: Velasha sees Shalen-Mor as too compromising; enabler of destruction
- **Potential**: Could become ally if Koresh-Val pushed too far

**Meshira-Tal** (Konor Dying Baron)
- **Relationship**: Tragic figure and wild card
- **History**: Once ally; desperation has made her unpredictable
- **Dynamic**: Shalen-Mor pities her but can't save Konor
- **Current**: Seeking ancient superweapon; Shalen-Mor fears what she might unleash
- **Danger**: Nothing to lose; might make catastrophic choice

### Hidden Threats

**Nethvor** (Shadow Baron)
- **Relationship**: Unknown enemy
- **History**: "Nethvor" is title held by rotating conspiracy leaders
- **Dynamic**: Shalen-Mor knows Nethvor exists; doesn't know who leads currently
- **Current**: Nethvor infiltrates everything; probably has agents in Shalen-Mor's own staff
- **Threat Level**: EXTREME - could assassinate, blackmail, or manipulate at will

**Morshan** (Rebel Leader)
- **Relationship**: Ideological opposition turned violent enemy
- **History**: No personal history; different generations
- **Dynamic**: Morshan sees Shalen-Mor as symbol of failed system
- **Current**: Breakers target Council infrastructure; Shalen-Mor can't stop them
