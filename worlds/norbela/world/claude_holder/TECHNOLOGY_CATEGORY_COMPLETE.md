## ✨ Key Achievements

### 1. **Complete Device Framework**

**How Devices Work**:
1. Shyak reservoir (fuel tank)
2. Arcane matrix (crystalline focus)
3. Mechanical components (standard engineering)
4. Control mechanisms (operation)

**Not Magical Themselves**:
- Made from normal materials
- Magic only when fuel burns
- No enchantments
- Engineering + fuel = function

### 2. **Comprehensive Catalog**

**By Category**:
- **Lighting**: Lamps (50-200 GS), streetlights, lanterns
- **Communication**: Message stones (500-2K GS), scrying mirrors (10K+ GS), telegraph
- **Transport**: Carriages (5K-20K GS), rail (tickets 10-50 GS), skyships (2M GS, 50% crash rate)
- **Weapons**: Firearms (200-500 GS), cannons (50K-200K GS), blades, grenades
- **Medical**: Surgery kits (5K-20K GS), regeneration tanks (100K+ GS), life extension (50K GS + 5-10K/year)
- **Industrial**: Forges, looms, pumps, automata (60% failure rate)
- **Household**: Climate control (10K-50K GS), elevators, self-cleaning
- **Security**: Surveillance, wards, detectors
- **Forbidden**: Slave collars, soul transfer, necromancy, corruption chambers

### 3. **Economic Reality**

**Fuel Costs** (at 50 GS/liter):
- Lamp: 5 GS/day
- Message stone: 100 GS/hour
- Carriage: 250 GS/hour (running)
- Climate control: 500 GS/day
- Factory: 10,000 GS/day

**Class Access**:
- **Elite household**: 20-50 liters/day = 1,000-2,500 GS/day
- **Factory**: 100-500 liters/day = 5,000-25,000 GS/day
- **Lower class**: Can't afford any (use fauxil in cheap devices)

### 4. **Failure Rates Documented**

**Reliability by Complexity**:
- Simple (lamps, heaters): 90-95% reliable
- Medium (carriages, firearms): 75-90% reliable
- Complex (automata, scrying): 60-80% reliable
- Experimental (skyships, entropy reversal): **50%+ failure rate**

**Annual Casualties**:
- Device explosions: 50-200 deaths per incident (3-5/year)
- Rail accidents: 200-500 deaths/year
- Skyship crashes: 100% fatality (50% crash rate)
- Industrial accidents: 500-1,000 deaths/year

### 5. **Forbidden Tech Detailed**

**Banned But Used**:
- Entropy weapons: Mutations, slow death
- Soul transfer: 1% success, 99% screaming flesh-piles
- Necromancy: Zombies and specters
- Corruption chambers: 20% success = super-soldiers (insane, short-lived)
- Mass extraction: Instant dead zones

**Why Banned**: Too dangerous  
**Reality**: Nethvor sells all of above
