## I. Core Identity

### The High Concept

**Norbela** is a frigid iceworld orbiting a blue sun where all magic originates from creatures that metabolize **finyak**, a primordial arcane substrate. Humans cannot use magic directly—they must harvest **shyak** (arcane oil) from magical animals to power an increasingly desperate industrial civilization consuming the very life force that keeps them alive.

**Genre**: Dark fantasy / Industrial arcane-punk / Ecological horror  
**Tech Era**: 1880s magitech (steam + magic oil)  
**Tone**: Collapse inevitable, exploitation normalized, hope scarce

### What Makes This World Unique

1. **Magic is biology, not mysticism**: No spells, no wizards, only creature-derived fuel
2. **The cold dominates everything**: Life clusters around warmth; isolation kills
3. **Ecological collapse in progress**: 40% dead zones and expanding
4. **Rigid caste stratification**: Access to magic = social status
5. **The end is visible**: Extinction projected within 10-30 years

### Core Conflicts

- **Extraction vs. Conservation**: Survive now or preserve tomorrow?
- **Inequality**: Elite luxury vs. underclass suffering
- **Desperation**: Moral lines blur as resources vanish
- **Knowledge vs. Greed**: Solutions exist but profit prevents change
- **Individual vs. System**: Can anyone stop the machine?

### Thematic Spine (LOCKED)

All stories in Norbela are built around six interlocking themes:

**Identity**: What remains after the system. Caste performance erodes selfhood until the mask becomes the face. After decades of performing your caste, is there a "real you" underneath?

**Mask**: Social performance (mandatory), psychological defense (necessary), literal disguise (rare). They blur into each other. The stories people tell themselves to survive complicity aren't lies — they're survival mechanisms. The horror is that they work.

**Monster**: Literal transformation (shyak consumption changes bodies), behavioral monstrosity (the system creates cruelty through normalization), identity dissolution (consuming sentient creatures leaves traces — not possession, but contamination).

**Found Family**: How people survive when blood families are destroyed by design. Precious, functional, complicated, and deliberately targeted by the system because loyalty outside institutional control is dangerous.

**Bloodlines**: Political power structure AND biological contamination. Generations of elite shyak consumption have made baron families physically different — not superior, contaminated. Lower-caste bloodlines are liabilities, not assets.

**The Creature Question**: The mirror that reflects everything back. If creatures have identity, what makes human identity more real? The boundary between harvester and harvested blurs.

**Synthesis**: *The system doesn't create monsters — it reveals that the distinction between person and monster was always negotiable.*

## II. Planetary Parameters

### Physical Characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Diameter** | 9,557 km (75% of Earth) |
| **Gravity** | 0.56g (56% of Earth) |
| **Day Length** | 45 hours |
| **Year Length** | 450 local days (20,250 standard hours) |
| **Axial Tilt** | 27° |
| **Orbital Eccentricity** | 0.20 (moderate ellipse) |

| **Atmosphere** | 0.7 bar (thin, cold) |
| **Average Temperature** | -5°C to 10°C |
| **Climate Type** | Iceworld |

### The Blue Sun

**Blaysol** (Kalen-Tal, "Bright Sky") casts pale blue-white light across the frozen landscape. The distant star provides insufficient warmth—most regions remain permanently frozen except near geothermal hotspots and magical creature concentrations.

**Visual Effects**:
- Sky ranges from deep cobalt to pale turquoise
- Snow and ice glow with blue shimmer
- Auroras are vivid (blue, violet, white)
- Flora adapted to blue-spectrum photosynthesis
- Long shadows, dramatic contrasts

### Climate Zones

- **Equatorial (Temperate)**: -5°C to 15°C
- **Mid-latitude**: -10°C to 5°C  
- **Polar (Vashor)**: -30°C to -5°C
- **Volcanic (Sulenor)**: 0°C to 20°C (rare warm zones)
- **Dead Zones**: Varies wildly, extremely hostile

### Day-Night Cycle

**45-Hour Days**:
- ~23 hours daylight (blue sunlight)
- ~22 hours darkness (auroras, ring-light, magical glow)
- Extended temperature swings
- Human sleep cycles adapted (polyphasic common)
- Extended work shifts possible

### Seasons (450-Day Year)

1. **Telian-Kalen** (Bright Awakening): 112 days - Spring warmth
2. **Val-Mer** (Fire Power): 113 days - Peak summer, perihelion
3. **Selyak** (Harvest): 112 days - Autumn stabilization  
4. **Neshmir-Tropush** (Entropy Winter): 113 days - Deep freeze, aphelion

## III. Magic System

### The Fundamental Rule

**ONLY ANIMALS POSSESS MAGIC.**

- Weather, substrate, plants, fungi, crystals = **non-magical**
- Humans **cannot** use magic directly (zero innate ability)
- All usable magic comes from creatures via biological extraction

### The Energy Chain

1. **Finyak** (primordial substrate) exists deep underground and in atmosphere
2. **Magical creatures** metabolize finyak via symbiotic microfauna
3. **Shyak** (arcane oil) is produced and stored in creature tissues
4. **Humans harvest** shyak (lethal or non-lethal extraction)
5. **Devices burn/channel** shyak to produce magical effects
6. **Byproducts** create pollution, entropy, environmental damage

### Finyak: The Source

**Properties**:
- Ancient primordial mineral/energy field
- Exists in varying concentrations across regions
- Cannot be mined or directly accessed by humans
- Only metabolized by magical creatures
- Finite and depletable
- Conservation principle applies (cannot create/destroy)

**Distribution**:
- Highest in crystal mountains and volcanic zones
- Moderate in ancient forests
- Depleted in **shisolak** (dead zones/arcane deserts)
- Delivered to atmosphere via moon eruption → ring → magical rain cycle

### Magical Creatures

**Diversity**:
- Range from simple energy-feeders to sentient beings
- Each species produces unique shyak composition
- Adapted to local finyak conditions
- Some can communicate, problem-solve, use tools
- **Symbiotic microfauna** within them produce the actual oil

**Examples**: See detailed creature catalog for 20+ species

### Shyak (Arcane Oil)

**Production**:
- Secreted by symbiotic microbes in creature glands
- Quality varies by species, diet, health, habitat
- Continuous production but limited rate
- Magical charge degrades over time

**Grades**:
- **High-Grade**: Pure, stable, expensive (elite use)
- **Standard**: Refined, reliable, regulated (middle class)
- **Fauxil**: Synthetic blend with runoff (unstable, cheap)
- **Slagcells**: Runoff batteries (weak, underclass)
- **Bonewire**: Bone conduits (illegal in some regions)

**Uses**:
- Fuel for all arcane devices
- Basis of entire economy
- Medical applications
- Alchemical ingredients
- Social status marker

### How Devices Work

**Components**:
1. Shyak reservoir (tank, cartridge, battery)
2. Arcane matrix (crystalline focus structure)
3. Mechanical components (gears, pistons, conduits)
4. Control mechanisms (levers, dials, switches)

**Principle**:
- Load shyak → activate matrix → oil burns through crystal → desired effect produced → byproducts released

**Not Magical Themselves**:
- Devices are engineered objects (metal, glass, wood, crystal)
- Magic only occurs during fuel consumption
- No enchantments or inherent power

**Instability**:
- Simple devices (lamps): Reliable
- Medium devices (carriages): Occasional failures
- Complex devices (automata): High failure rate
- Experimental: 50%+ failure rate

### Magical Phenomena

**Shenesh** (Magical Entropy):
- Every magical process increases entropy
- Makes future magic less efficient/more unstable
- High-entropy regions experience accidents, failures, mutations
- Accumulates in environment as pollution

**Suvaanyak** (Resonance Cascade):
- Overuse causes magical instability
- Device surges, mutations, local null zones
- Self-reinforcing feedback loops
- Delayed consequences (appear years later)

**Shisolak** (Dead Zones):
- Permanently depleted arcane deserts
- Magic fails completely
- Hostile to all life
- Currently 40% of landmass (expanding 10%/year)

## VI. Economics

### The Shyak Economy

**Basis of Everything**:
- All industry powered by shyak
- All transport requires shyak
- All advanced capabilities need shyak
- Without creatures: Immediate collapse to pre-industrial

**Market Dynamics**:
- Prices fluctuate by supply, demand, purity, resonance
- Scarcity driven by creature populations declining
- Black markets thrive (30% of supply)
- Elite control extraction territories
- Underclass survive on alternatives (fauxil, slagcells)

**Three-Fuel System** (1780-present):
1. **Pure Shyak**: High-grade creature oil (elite, military, critical)
2. **Fauxil**: Synthetic blend with runoff (middle, common)
3. **Bonewire/Slagcells**: Waste products (underclass, black market)

### The Baron Council

**Nine Seats of Power**:
- Each baron controls extraction territories
- Intermarry, plot, assassinate, war
- No central authority (council deadlocked)
- Profits > survival (refuse conservation)

**Power Bases**:
- Extraction territories (creature habitats)
- Refineries and factories
- Private armies
- Trade monopolies
- Guild control

---

## VII. Technology (1880s Magitech)

### Capabilities

**Transportation**:
- Arcane carriages (wealthy)
- Sled-rail networks
- Airships (rare, unstable)
- Telegraph systems

**Industry**:
- Factories powered by shyak
- Automata and golems
- Arcane forges
- Chemical refineries

**Daily Life**:
- Arcane lighting (by class)
- Heating systems (critical for survival)
- Communication devices
- Medical devices (healing beds, surgical tools)

**Military**:
- Arcane rifles and cannons
- Siege golems
- War-beasts
- Forbidden weapons (genocide-capable)

### Limitations

**Instability**: Complex devices fail frequently  
**Fuel Dependency**: No shyak = no function  
**Entropy Buildup**: Repeated use degrades devices  
**Class Access**: Technology correlates with wealth  
**Environmental Cost**: Every device accelerates collapse

## VIII. Historical Timeline

### Key Periods

**Ancient Era** (Unknown-1500): Medieval kingdoms, no industrial magic  
**Discovery Era** (1500-1540): Shyak discovered, refineries built  
**Expansion Era** (1540-1650): Rapid growth, bio-cartography, exploitation begins  
**Industrial Growth** (1650-1750): Factories, cities, first species collapses  
**First Crisis** (1700-1750): Economic depression, conservation attempts (failed)  
**Peak Industrial** (1780-1872): Maximum extraction, warnings ignored  
**The Second Cascade** (June 21, 1872): 100K+ killed, 500K km² instant dead zone  
**Current Crisis** (1872-1900): 40% dead zones, population collapse, extinction imminent

### Current Situation (1900)

**Population**: 8.2 million (down from 16M in 1870)  
**Dead Zones**: 40% (expanding 10%/year)  
**Projection**: Extinction in 10-30 years unless change occurs  
**Response**: Elite refuse conservation; extraction wars escalate  

### Active Conflicts

- **Sulenor invasion of Eshtor**: Resources grab
- **Konor desperation**: Searching for ancient weapon
- **Vashor vanishings**: 10,000 people disappeared
- **Gen-Sorath siege**: Capital under attack
- **Extraction Wars**: Barons fighting over remaining territories

---

## IX. Key Factions

**The Baron Council**: Nine rulers, deadlocked, profit-focused  
**The Breakers** (Morshan): Revolutionary movement, violent, desperate  
**Nethvor-Shadows**: Criminal empire, black market dominators  
**Vornalen-Keepers**: Conservationists, forest protectors, losing  
**The Inquisition**: Religious zealots, brutal enforcers  
**Guild Coalitions**: Professional groups, self-interested  
**The Unseeded**: Unregistered masses, survival-focused

---

## X. Core Themes

**Ecological Collapse**: Visible, measurable, accelerating extinction  
**Class Warfare**: Rigid stratification, normalized exploitation  
**Moral Erosion**: Desperation destroys ethics  
**Systemic Inertia**: Solutions exist but systems prevent implementation  
**The Cost of Comfort**: Elite luxury requires mass suffering  
**Too Late?**: Can anything stop the machine?

### Thematic Pillars (Story-Level)

**Identity/Mask/Monster**:
- You become what you consume, perform, and are forced to be
- Long-term shyak consumption literally transforms elite bodies (contamination, not evolution)
- Consuming sentient creatures leaves identity traces (preferences, dream fragments)
- Caste performance erodes authentic selfhood
- The mask becomes the face; the system creates monsters through normalization

**Found Family/Bloodlines**:
- Blood families are destroyed by design at lower castes
- Found families (survival units) are how people actually survive
- Elite bloodlines are power structures AND biological contamination
- Creature bloodlines mirror human bloodlines (breeding programs, optimization for yield)
- The system targets found families because loyalty outside control is dangerous

**Key Phrases**:
- *"You become what you consume. The question is whether you notice."*
- *"The mask becomes the face. The face becomes the mask."*
- *"Blood is what you're born with. Family is what you'd die for."*
- *"They're just animals. That's what we tell ourselves. That's what they'll say about us."*

## XI. Consistency Rules

1. **Magic only from creatures** - No exceptions
2. **Cold dominates** - Survival requires warmth sources
3. **Caste is visible** - Clothing, health, access obvious
4. **Devices need fuel** - No perpetual motion
5. **Entropy accumulates** - Every use has environmental cost
6. **Dead zones expand** - Crisis is measurable and real
7. **Barons won't change** - Systemic resistance to conservation
8. **The clock is ticking** - Extinction is mathematically projected
