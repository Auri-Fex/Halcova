## I. Currency & Monetary System

### Primary Currency: **Shard** (Standard Gold/Silver Coins)

#### Denominations
1. **Gold Shard** (GS): 1 GS = standard unit
2. **Silver Shard** (SS): 10 SS = 1 GS
3. **Copper Bit** (CB): 100 CB = 1 SS (1,000 CB = 1 GS)
4. **Iron Scrip** (IS): Company tokens; 1 IS = ~0.5 CB (varies by company; often worthless outside company stores)

#### Value References
- **Loaf of bread**: 2-5 CB
- **Daily wage (Korbal laborer)**: 50-100 CB
- **Daily wage (Telkorin craftsman)**: 5-10 SS
- **Monthly rent (Korbal tenement)**: 20-30 SS
- **Monthly salary (Meshkorin professional)**: 100-300 GS
- **Yearly income (minor Baron)**: 50,000-100,000 GS
- **1 liter refined shyak**: 10-50 GS (depending on quality/source)

---

### Secondary Currency: **Shyak Credits**

#### System
- Major transactions (land, ships, bulk magical oil) conducted in **Shyak Credits (SC)**
- 1 SC = promissory note for 100 liters refined shyak
- Backed by Shyakorin Council reserves
- Only upper castes/guilds can hold SC accounts

#### Purpose
- Stabilize magical oil market (prevents hoarding/speculation)
- Control who can trade in bulk magic
- Baron tool to manipulate economy

#### Corruption
- Counterfeit SC notes (Nethvor-Shadows produces high-quality fakes)
- Fraudulent reserves (some Barons claim more shyak than they possess)
- Credit manipulation (Barons cancel rivals' credits; seize assets)

---

## II. The Magical Oil Trade (Shyak Economy)

### Production Chain

#### 1. **Harvesting** (Extraction)
**Actors**: Extraction companies (Baron-owned or licensed)
**Process**:
- Hunt/capture magical creatures
- Kill humanely (Faith of First Blood requirement) OR brutally (illegal but common)
- Drain body of shyak (varies by creature: shera = 20-40L, balkor = 2-5L, etc.)
- Dispose of corpse (burn, dump, occasionally use for other materials)

**Labor**:
- **Hunters**: Skilled (Telkorin/Meshkorin); armed; dangerous work; 30% mortality rate over 5 years
- **Butchers**: Unskilled (Korbal); extract shyak; exposure causes corruption; 50% develop mutations
- **Transporters**: Move raw shyak to refineries; targets for bandits; 20% loss rate to theft/attacks

**Profit Margin**: Raw shyak sells for 2-5 GS/L to refineries

#### 2. **Refining** (Processing)
**Actors**: Refinery corporations (Baron-owned)
**Process**:
- Filter raw shyak (remove impurities, corrupted elements)
- Distill into grades (low-grade for industry, mid-grade for magic users, high-grade for elite)
- By-products: corrupted sludge (toxic waste; dumped in poor neighborhoods/wilderness)

**Labor**:
- **Refinery workers (Korbal)**: 14-16 hour shifts; exposure to fumes; average lifespan = 10 years post-hire
- **Technicians (Telkorin)**: Operate arcane distillation equipment; better paid but still hazardous
- **Overseers (Meshkorin)**: Enforce quotas; brutal disciplinarians

**Profit Margin**: Refined shyak sells for 10-50 GS/L (depending on grade)

#### 3. **Distribution** (Trade)
**Actors**: Merchant guilds, barons, smugglers
**Process**:
- Transport refined shyak to cities, guilds, military, private buyers
- Tariffs at borders (10-30% depending on baron relations)
- Black market bypass (Nethvor-Shadows controls ~60% of illegal trade)

**Labor**:
- **Caravan guards**: Protect shipments; frequent attacks by Breakers, bandits, desperate Finyakor
- **Merchants**: Negotiate deals; bribe officials; navigate politics

**Profit Margin**: Final sale price = 20-100 GS/L (varies by scarcity, quality, location)

---

### Market Dynamics

#### Supply & Demand
- **Demand**: Constant and growing (magic powers everything; addiction common)
- **Supply**: Declining (creatures dying faster than reproducing; entropy zones expanding)
- **Price Trend**: Rising ~5-10% per year; accelerating as supply falls

#### Regional Variations
- **Sulenor** (Koresh-Val's territory): Abundant fire-creature sources; lower prices; aggressive extraction
- **Eshtor** (Velasha-Nen's territory): Moderate supply; higher prices; conservation efforts slow extraction
- **Vashor** (Threnok-Gash's territory): Rare ice-creatures; highest quality; extremely expensive; controlled supply
- **Konor** (Meshira-Tal's territory): Near-zero supply; importing at ruinous cost; economic collapse

#### Price Manipulation
- **Barons hoard supplies**: Create artificial scarcity; drive up prices
- **Embargoes**: Barons refuse trade with enemies; weapon of economic warfare
- **Dumping**: Baron floods market with cheap shyak; crashes prices; bankrupts competitors

---

### Black Market

#### Nethvor-Shadows Network
- **Market Share**: 60% of illegal trade
- **Activities**: Smuggling (bypassing tariffs), stolen shyak (from refineries), counterfeit shyak (diluted/corrupted; dangerous), laundering (legitimizing stolen oil)
- **Profit**: ~30 million GS per year
- **Corruption**: Bribes officials, guard captains, customs agents; owns judges; runs ports

#### Independent Smugglers
- **Market Share**: 25% of illegal trade
- **Activities**: Small-scale; high-risk; undercut Nethvor prices
- **Profit**: Modest; survival-level for most
- **Risk**: Caught = execution or forced indenture; Nethvor eliminates competition violently

#### Rebel Trade (Morshan-Breakers)
- **Market Share**: 15% of illegal trade
- **Activities**: Steal shyak from extractionists; sell to fund operations; sabotage shipments
- **Profit**: ~2 million GS per year (all to revolution)
- **Ideology**: "Liberate" shyak; redistribute to poor (some); sell to fund attacks (most)

- **Outcomes**: Starvation, crime, prostitution, indenture, death
- **No Safety Net**: No unemployment insurance, welfare, or charity (except church; requires conversion/servitude)

---

## IV. Debt & Credit Systems

### Legitimate Lending (Banks & Guilds)

- **Upper Castes**: 3-5% per year (low risk; collateral abundant)
- **Middle Castes**: 10-15% per year (moderate risk; guild-backed)
- **Lower Castes**: 30-50% per year (high risk; no collateral; predatory)

#### Collateral
- **Upper Castes**: Land, extraction rights, ships
- **Middle Castes**: Property, guild membership, future earnings
- **Lower Castes**: Body (indenture contracts), family (sell children), organs (literally)

#### Default Consequences
- **Upper Castes**: Rarely default; if so, negotiate restructuring
- **Middle Castes**: Property seized; social ruin; fall to lower caste
- **Lower Castes**: Indenture, slavery, or death

---

### Predatory Lending (Loan Sharks)

#### Actors
- **Nethvor-Shadows**: Largest predatory lender; 40% of loan-shark market
- **Independent Sharks**: Local criminals; brutal; small-scale
- **Company Stores**: Extractionist companies lend to workers; trap in debt

#### Terms
- **Interest**: 100-300% per year
- **Collection**: Violence immediate; break legs, burn homes, kill family members as warnings
- **Default**: Indenture (sold to highest bidder), organ harvesting, forced crime (work for shark as thug)

#### Debt Traps (Company Stores)
- Workers paid in **scrip** (only valid at company store)
- Store sells necessities at 200-300% markup
- Workers forced to borrow; debt accumulates; never escape
- Debt inherited by children (generational slavery)

---

### Debt Slavery Pipeline
1. **Emergency**: Worker needs money (medical, food, shelter)
2. **Loan**: Borrow from shark or company; terms hidden/unreadable
3. **Trap**: Interest compounds; penalties added; debt grows
4. **Default**: Can't repay; threatened with violence
5. **Indenture**: Sign contract "voluntarily" to avoid murder; now property
6. **Extension**: Debt never decreases; contract extended indefinitely
7. **Generational**: Children inherit debt; family trapped

**Scale**: ~15% of population in debt-slavery pipeline at any time
