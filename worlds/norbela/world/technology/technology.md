# Technology Limits & Capabilities

**Genre**: Dark Fantasy / Arcane Punk / Hard R
**Focus**: Magitech, limitations, body horror from misuse, unequal access, reckless innovation

---

## I. Fundamental Principles

### Magic Source
- **ALL magic comes from creatures** (fauna only; flora has no magic)
- **Shyak (magical oil)**: Extracted from creature bodies post-mortem
- **Entropy Consequence**: Using magic depletes world's life force; accelerates death of ecosystems
- **No Human Magic**: Humans possess ZERO innate magical ability; entirely dependent on harvested shyak

### Arcane Technology Framework
- **Shyak as Fuel**: Devices powered by burning/channeling magical oil (like gasoline engines)
- **Arcane Matrices**: Crystalline structures that focus/direct shyak's power
- **Artifice**: Engineering discipline that combines shyak, matrices, mechanical components
- **Instability**: More complex device = more unstable = higher chance of catastrophic failure

---

## II. What Magic CAN Do

### 1. **Energy Generation**
**Capabilities**:
- Heating (arcane furnaces in upper-caste homes; limited in middle castes)
- Lighting (arcane lamps; range from stable city lights to flickering personal lanterns)
- Cooling (rare; expensive; only upper castes; uses 10x shyak of heating)
- Power for machinery (factory equipment, arcane engines)

**Limits**:
- Efficiency ~40% (60% lost as waste heat, entropy discharge)
- Requires constant fuel; devices stop when shyak runs out
- Large-scale power requires massive shyak consumption (unsustainable)

**Hard R**:
- Refinery workers exposed to waste entropy; develop tumors, mutations, madness
- Poor neighborhoods built near refineries; cancer rates 300% higher; authorities ignore

---

### 2. **Communication**
**Capabilities**:
- **Message Stones** (paired crystals; speak into one, other hears; range ~100km)
- **Scrying Mirrors** (visual communication; rare; expensive; range ~50km)
- **Arcane Telegraph** (text transmission via crystalline network; limited to major cities)

**Limits**:
- Message stones: Expensive (500-2,000 GS per pair); only upper/middle castes afford
- Scrying mirrors: Extremely expensive (10,000+ GS); mostly barons/military; image fuzzy; requires skilled operator
- Telegraph: Fixed infrastructure; monitored by authorities; messages not private
- ALL forms consume shyak (1-5 liters per hour of use)
- Entropy zones block signals; expanding dead zones isolate regions

**Social Impact**:
- Information travels at speed of wealth; poor rely on messengers (slow, unreliable)
- Barons monitor communications; dissent detected; crushed
- Nethvor-Shadows compromised telegraph network; intercepts messages; blackmail goldmine

---

### 3. **Transportation**
**Capabilities**:
- **Arcane Carriages** (self-propelled vehicles; 30-50 km/h; range 200km per shyak tank)
- **Arcane Rail** (trains on crystalline tracks; 80-100 km/h; long-distance)
- **Skyships** (experimental; floating vessels; 40-60 km/h; extremely unstable)

**Limits**:
- Carriages: Expensive (5,000-20,000 GS); only upper castes; maintenance costly; breakdowns common
- Rail: Limited routes (5 major lines continent-wide); tickets expensive (10-50 GS per trip); frequent delays/accidents
- Skyships: 50% failure rate; crashes kill everyone aboard; only military and reckless researchers use
- No teleportation; no flight for individuals; no portals (pure fantasy; impossible with shyak-based magic)

**Hard R**:
- Rail accidents kill 200-500 per year; mostly workers/lower-caste passengers in cheap cars; bodies mangled
- Skyship crashes: Fiery explosions; falling from sky; wreckage spread over kilometers; no survivors

---

### 4. **Weaponry**
**Capabilities**:
- **Arcane Firearms** (musket-equivalents; fire bolts of condensed shyak; lethal)
  - Range: 50-100 meters
  - Rate: 1 shot per 10-15 seconds (reload time)
  - Lethality: Instant death on torso hit; limb shots maim/amputate
- **Arcane Cannons** (artillery; devastating but slow)
  - Range: 500-1,000 meters
  - Payload: Explosive shyak charges or entropy bombs
  - Lethality: 10-50 meter kill radius
- **Arcane Blades** (swords/spears infused with shyak; cut through armor)
  - Enhanced sharpness; cauterizes wounds; agonizing injuries
- **Entropy Grenades** (experimental; release concentrated entropy; corrupt everything in blast radius)
  - Range: 20 meter kill radius; 50 meter mutation radius
  - Effect: Victims mutate, die slowly, scream for hours/days

**Limits**:
- Firearms: Expensive (200-500 GS); ammo expensive (1 GS per shot); only military/mercenaries/elites
- Cannons: Massive shyak consumption (50-100 liters per shot); only barons afford
- Entropy weapons: Banned by Council (too dangerous); Nethvor-Shadows and desperate barons use anyway
- No rapid-fire; no machine guns; no bombs beyond crude grenades

**Hard R**:
- Arcane firearms: Wounds don't bleed; cauterized; victims die from shock/organ failure; screaming
- Entropy grenades: Mutations horrific (flesh melts, bones twist, eyes burst); victims beg for death; mercy killings common
- Arcane blades: Cut limbs clean; soldiers collect ears, hands as trophies

---

### 5. **Medicine & Healing**
**Capabilities**:
- **Arcane Surgery** (use shyak to seal wounds, mend bones, remove tumors)
  - Success rate: 80% for skilled healers (Keshiel-Circle elite)
  - Availability: Upper castes only (1,000+ GS per procedure)
- **Regeneration** (regrow lost limbs, organs; extremely expensive)
  - Success rate: 60%
  - Cost: 10,000-50,000 GS
  - Availability: Barons only

  - Success rate: 70-90%
  - Cost: 100-5,000 GS depending on disease
  - Availability: Middle/upper castes only

**Limits**:
- Cannot cure entropy corruption (irreversible; always fatal)
- Cannot resurrect dead (once dead, soul is gone; necromancy creates soulless horrors)
- Cannot cure madness caused by entropy exposure
- Cannot regrow brain tissue (head wounds = death or permanent disability)
- Healing consumes shyak (1-50 liters depending on severity)

**Social Impact**:
- Lower castes die from treatable diseases (can't afford)
- Mortality rate: Upper castes 1%, middle castes 10%, lower castes 40% (from preventable illness)
- Black market healing: Unskilled charlatan healers; 50% success rate; often make worse; poor's only option

**Hard R**:
- Failed regeneration: Limbs grow back wrong (twisted, useless, painful); amputation necessary; agony
- Failed surgeries: Shyak infusions go wrong; flesh fuses incorrectly; patients scream; mercy-killed
- Life extension side effects: Eldritchly aged (skin translucent, organs visible, constant pain); addicted to shyak; withdrawal = rapid aging = death
- Experimental healing: Lower castes used as test subjects; 70% die; survivors often mutated

- **Arcane Looms** (weave fabric faster than manual labor; 10x productivity)
- **Arcane Pumps** (drain mines, irrigate fields, supply cities with water)
- **Arcane Mills** (grind grain, process materials efficiently)

**Limits**:
- Machines replace workers (unemployment crisis)
- Require constant shyak (factories consume 100-500 liters per day)
- Breakdowns common (devices explode; entropy leaks; workers die)
- Only large operations afford (small craftsmen bankrupted; monopolies form)

**Hard R**:
- Industrial accidents: Workers pulled into machines; crushed, shredded; bodies removed while machines keep running
- Entropy exposure: Factory workers develop mutations (extra fingers, eyes, tentacles); fired when no longer useful; become Finyakor
- Explosions: Device failures cause entropy blasts; entire factories incinerated; 50-200 deaths per incident; 3-5 per year

---

### 7. **Construction & Infrastructure**
**Capabilities**:
- **Arcane Lifts** (elevators; powered by shyak; limited to tallest buildings)
- **Wards Against Entropy** (barriers slow entropy spread; protect buildings, cities)
- **Self-Repairing Materials** (shyak-infused stone/metal; slowly heals cracks)
- **Climate Control** (heat/cool buildings; only upper castes)

**Limits**:
- Wards: Expensive to create (10,000-100,000 GS) and maintain (1,000+ GS per year); only wealthy areas protected
- Self-repair: Slow (takes weeks); consumes shyak; eventually fails
- Large-scale projects (dams, bridges, walls) require massive shyak investment; fewer built as supply declines

**Social Impact**:
- Poor neighborhoods unprotected; entropy consumes them; residents evacuate or die
- Upper-caste districts pristine; high walls; wards; separate cities within cities
- Infrastructure decay: Bridges collapse; roads crumble; authorities ignore (poor can't pay for repairs)

---

**Limits**:
- Arcane eyes: Expensive (1,000+ GS each); range 100 meters; easily destroyed
- Wards: Only wealthy afford; easily bypassed by skilled thieves (Nethvor-Shadows specializes)
- Detectors: Unreliable; false positives common; used to harass lower castes

**Abuse**:
- Barons spy on rivals, dissidents, citizens
- Arcane eyes placed in bedrooms, bathrooms (blackmail material)
- Wards used to keep poor out of wealthy districts; trespassers killed on sight

---

## III. What Magic CANNOT Do

### 1. **Resurrection**
- Dead is dead; soul leaves body; no retrieval
- Necromancy: Can animate corpses; soulless puppets; abominations; illegal everywhere

### 2. **Teleportation**
- No instant travel; no portals; no short-range blinking
- Theory exists; practice requires amounts of shyak that would drain entire regions

### 3. **Mind Control**
- Cannot control thoughts, actions, emotions directly
- Drugs (shyak derivatives) can alter behavior; not true mind control

### 4. **Weather Manipulation**
- Cannot summon rain, storms, change climate
- Small-scale effects (create fog, chill room) possible; large-scale impossible

### 5. **Prophecy (True)**
- Vonder-Shin's visions are exception (innate gift; not magic-based)
- Attempts to create prophetic magic fail; produce hallucinations only

### 6. **Unlimited Power**
- All devices limited by shyak supply
- No perpetual motion; no free energy; thermodynamics apply

### 7. **Magical Creatures (Creation)**
- Cannot create life; cannot make new magical creatures
- All existing creatures are natural; magic inherent to them; harvesting kills them

- Koresh-Val experiments with entropy artillery (corrupt entire battlefields)

**Effects**:
- Victims mutate hideously; flesh melts; bones twist; madness
- Survivors sterile; cannot reproduce
- Land becomes dead zone; nothing grows; entropy permanent

---

### 2. **Soul Transfer**
**Description**: Move consciousness from dying body to new one; achieve immortality
**Status**: Illegal; punishable by burning
**Reality**:
- Cult of the Undying experiments constantly; 99% failure rate
- Failures produce abominations (bodies with multiple souls; madness; screaming)
- 1% "successes" debatable (personality changes; original soul destroyed?)

**Effects**:
- Failed transfers: Writhing flesh-piles; multiple faces; scream in agony; unkillable; locked in dungeons
- "Successful" transfers: Recipients lose empathy; become sociopathic; memories fade; not really them

---

### 3. **Necromancy**
**Description**: Animate dead; create undead armies
**Status**: Illegal; death penalty
**Reality**:
- Practiced by desperate cult cells; Nethvor-Shadows occasionally uses
- Creates zombies (slow, stupid, decay rapidly) or specters (incorporeal, insane)

**Effects**:
- Zombies: Rotting corpses; contagious (necrotic touch infects living); must be burned
- Specters: Insane ghosts; possess living; drive mad; exorcism requires burning possessed alive

---

### 4. **Corruption Induction**
**Description**: Deliberately expose people to entropy; create mutant soldiers
**Status**: War crime (banned)
**Reality**:
- Koresh-Val's "Berserker Program" creates Koren-Thek and others
- Success rate: 20% (80% die in agony)
- Successes: Stronger, faster, pain-immune; also insane, short-lived, uncontrollable

**Effects**:
- Subjects scream during process (days-long); flesh bubbles; bones crack; grow extra limbs, eyes, teeth
- Survivors: Super-soldiers; 5-10 year lifespan post-corruption; die screaming as bodies fail

---

### 5. **Mass Extraction**
**Description**: Drain entire ecosystems of shyak simultaneously (genocide of all creatures in region)
**Status**: Banned (too destabilizing)
**Reality**:
- Koresh-Val wants to do this; Velasha-Nen will go to war to prevent
- Technology exists; scale-up is possible

**Effects**:
- Region becomes instant dead zone; total entropy collapse
- 100,000+ creatures dead; species extinctions
- Cascade effect; neighboring regions destabilize

---

## V. Technological Failures & Accidents

### Common Failures
1. **Arcane Device Explosions** (3-5 major incidents per year)
   - Cause: Shyak overload, matrix fracture, operator error
   - Effect: 50-200 deaths per incident; entropy release; mutations in survivors
   - Response: Blame workers; no safety improvements

2. **Communication Blackouts** (frequent in entropy zones)
   - Cause: Entropy interference disrupts signals
   - Effect: Regions isolated; coordination impossible; vulnerability to attack

3. **Transportation Crashes** (200-500 deaths per year)
   - Cause: Device failure, shyak depletion, entropy disruption
   - Effect: Rail accidents, skyship crashes, carriage explosions; no survivors usually

4. **Healing Failures** (30-40% of healing attempts on lower castes)
   - Cause: Unskilled healers, insufficient shyak, advanced disease
   - Effect: Patients die; often worse off than before

5. **Infrastructure Collapse** (bridges, buildings, dams)
   - Cause: Wards fail; entropy consumes materials
   - Effect: Collapses kill hundreds; poor neighborhoods most affected
