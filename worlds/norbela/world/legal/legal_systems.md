## I. Governance Structure

### Continental Level: The Shyakorin Council

#### Composition
- **9 Regional Barons** (one per major territory)
- **1 High Archon** (elected by Barons; 20-year term; currently Shalen-Mor)
- **Council Guard** (~10,000 troops; enforce continental law)
- **Bureaucracy** (~5,000 officials; tax collection, trade regulation, records)

#### Powers
- **Regulate magical oil trade** (licensing, tariffs, quotas)
- **Declare war** (continental-level conflicts; requires 6/9 vote)
- **Mint currency** (Shards; backed by Council reserves)
- **Arbitrate baron disputes** (High Archon mediates; rarely successful)
- **Set continental laws** (requires 7/9 vote; rarely achieved)

#### Limitations
- **No enforcement power over barons** (each baron maintains private army)
- **Decisions require supermajority** (7/9); deadlock common
- **Corruption rampant** (bribes, blackmail, vote-buying)
- **Declining legitimacy** (lower castes see it as farce; revolutionaries reject it entirely)

#### Current Status (1,900)
- **Paralyzed**: Shalen-Mor dying; succession contested; no decisions possible
- **Civil war imminent**: Extraction Wars, Konor crisis, Archive siege all escalating; Council can't respond
- **Collapse likely**: Within 2 years; either civil war or entropy cascade will end it

---

### Regional Level: Baronies

#### Baron Powers (Within Territory)
- **Absolute authority**: Baron is executive, legislative, and judicial authority
- **Tax collection**: Set rates; no limits
- **Military**: Raise armies; declare wars (against other barons or internal enemies)
- **Justice**: Define crimes, punishments, courts; no appeals
- **Property**: Seize land, assets at will
- **Life/Death**: Execute anyone for any reason (or no reason)

#### Baron Responsibilities (Theoretical)
- **Order**: Maintain stability; suppress crime
- **Defense**: Protect territory from external threats
- **Infrastructure**: Roads, bridges, water, etc.
- **Welfare**: Ensure population survives (famine relief, plague response)

#### Reality
- **Responsibilities ignored**: Barons extract wealth; invest nothing; infrastructure decays
- **Order = oppression**: "Stability" means crushing dissent; no rights for lower castes
- **Defense = private interest**: Only protect profitable regions; poor areas abandoned
- **Welfare nonexistent**: Poor die; barons don't care

---

### Local Level: Cities, Towns, Villages

#### City Governance (Major Cities 50,000+)
- **Mayor** (appointed by baron; serves at pleasure)
- **City Guard** (1,000-5,000 troops; maintain order; collect taxes)
- **Courts** (baron's judges; enforce baron's law)
- **Guilds** (de facto governance of middle castes; regulate trades)

#### Town Governance (5,000-50,000)
- **Town Master** (appointed or hereditary; answers to baron)
- **Militia** (50-500; part-time; mostly ceremonial)
- **Magistrate** (single judge; handles minor crimes)

#### Village Governance (Under 5,000)
- **Village Elder** (elected by middle/upper caste residents)
- **No official law enforcement** (vigilante justice; blood feuds common)
- **Appeals to baron** (only if village can pay bribes; rarely happens)

---

## II. Legal Code & Crimes

### Continental Law (Applies Everywhere, Theoretically)

#### Capital Crimes (Death Penalty)
1. **Treason** (against Council or baron)
2. **Murder** (of upper/middle caste; killing lower caste often ignored)
3. **Heresy** (as defined by Faith of First Blood; enforced by Inquisition)
4. **Necromancy** (animating dead; creating undead)
5. **Counterfeit** (Shyak Credits; currency; death + torture)
6. **Piracy** (attacking baron's ships; hanging standard)
7. **Slavery Rebellion** (leading slave revolt; crucifixion standard)

#### High Crimes (Imprisonment, Torture, Indenture)
1. **Theft** (of significant value; >10 GS)
2. **Assault** (of upper/middle caste)
3. **Fraud** (business, magical goods)
4. **Smuggling** (bypassing tariffs)
5. **Illegal Gathering** (unions, protests, conspiracies)
6. **Desertion** (from military or indentured service)
7. **Trespassing** (on baron's/noble's property)

#### Minor Crimes (Fines, Flogging, Mutilation)
1. **Petty Theft** (food, small items; <10 GS)
2. **Disorderly Conduct** (public drunkenness, fighting)
3. **Unlicensed Trade** (operating without guild membership)
4. **Failure to Pay Taxes/Tithes** (garnishment, property seizure)
5. **Insult** (to noble, official, priest; subjective; abused)

---

### Regional Variations (Baron's Discretion)

#### Koresh-Val's Territory (Sulenor - Harsh)
- **Labor Law**: Unions = treason (death)
- **Environmental Crime**: Interfering with extraction = sabotage (death)
- **Weapon Possession**: Commoners possessing arcane firearms = death
- **Escape Attempts**: Slaves/indentured caught fleeing = crucifixion

#### Velasha-Nen's Territory (Eshtor - Conservationist)
- **Poaching**: Killing protected creatures = death
- **Deforestation**: Unauthorized logging = indenture + reforestation labor
- **Pollution**: Dumping waste in forests = heavy fines
- **Cooperation with Keepers**: Reporting poachers rewarded; harboring them = death

#### Soryn-Kesh's Territory (Sulenor Badlands - Theocratic)
- **Heresy**: Broad definition; questioning church = burning
- **Witchcraft**: Using magic without blessing = burning
- **Blasphemy**: Insult to faith = tongue removal + flogging
- **Sexual Deviance**: Homosexuality, adultery, sex work = public shaming + flogging

#### Dreshak-Mor's Territory (Eshtor Swamps - Anarchic)
- **Bribes Legalize Everything**: Pay enough; everything permitted
- **No Crime Too Serious**: Murder, slavery, trafficking all tolerated if bribe paid
- **Only Unforgivable Crime**: Failing to pay bribe; offending Dreshak personally

---

## III. Courts & Judicial Process

### Upper Caste Trials

#### Jurisdiction
- **Baron's High Court**: Baron personally presides; serious crimes only
- **Noble Arbitration**: Disputes between nobles; private arbitrators; no public record

#### Process
1. **Accusation**: Accuser presents evidence (witnesses, documents, arcane forensics)
2. **Defense**: Accused presents counter-evidence; hires advocates (lawyers; 500-5,000 GS)
3. **Deliberation**: Baron or appointed judges deliberate; days to weeks
4. **Verdict**: Announced publicly; detailed reasoning
5. **Punishment**: If guilty; often negotiated (fines, exile, rarely execution)

#### Reality
- **Outcome decided by bribes**: 90% of verdicts bought; evidence irrelevant
- **Political tool**: Trials used to eliminate rivals; legitimize seizures
- **Rarely executed**: Upper castes pay fines; transfer wealth; avoid real punishment

---

### Middle Caste Trials

#### Jurisdiction
- **City Courts**: Appointed judges; minor/moderate crimes
- **Guild Courts**: Internal guild discipline; members only

#### Process
1. **Accusation**: Formal complaint filed (5 GS fee; barrier for poor)
2. **Investigation**: City Guard investigates (bribes expected; 10-50 GS to get attention)
3. **Trial**: Judge hears case; 1-3 days; no jury
4. **Verdict**: Judge announces; minimal reasoning
5. **Punishment**: Fines (majority), flogging, imprisonment, indenture

#### Reality
- **Speed over justice**: Judges handle 50+ cases per day; 10 minutes per case
- **Presumption of guilt**: Accused must prove innocence; difficult without money
- **Bribes essential**: 100 GS bribe = favorable verdict 80% of time

---

### Lower Caste "Trials"

#### Jurisdiction
- **Summary Justice**: Guard captain on scene; immediate verdict
- **No Appeals**: Decision final; execution immediate if capital crime

#### Process
1. **Accusation**: Anyone accuses (often rival, enemy, or guard needing quota)
2. **Arrest**: Brutal; beaten during arrest; "resisting" = beaten worse
3. **"Trial"**: Guard captain asks "Did you do it?"; confession extracted via beating
4. **Verdict**: Guilty (always); innocent verdicts <1%
5. **Punishment**: Immediate; public; brutal

#### Reality
- **No justice**: System is control mechanism; guilt irrelevant
- **Quotas**: Guards must arrest X per month; invent crimes if needed
- **Corruption**: Guards extort bribes; "pay or we arrest you for something"
- **Scapegoats**: Lower castes blamed for elite crimes; easy convictions

---

### Indentured/Slaves (No Trials)
- **Property Status**: Owners handle discipline; no courts involved
- **No Rights**: Can be tortured, maimed, killed without consequence
- **Complaints Ignored**: If slave complains about owner; beaten for insolence
- **Only Limit**: Damaging another's property (owner can be sued for damages to other's slave)

## V. Law Enforcement

### Council Guard (Continental Level)

#### Role
- Enforce Council law (in theory)
- Protect Council members
- Suppress large-scale threats (rebellions, invasions)
- Guard borders between baronies

#### Reality
- **Fragmented Loyalty**: Guards serve barons who pay them, not Council
- **Corruption**: Accept bribes routinely; turn blind eye to baron crimes

- **Training**: Minimal; weeks; brutality emphasized

#### Reality
- **Extortion**: Guards supplement income by extorting civilians; "protection money" common

#### Reality
- **Lawless**: Answer only to employer; kill trespassers without trial

- **Impunity**: Barons protect them; no prosecution

---

### Inquisition (Religious Police)

#### Role
- Hunt heretics
- Enforce religious orthodoxy
- Extract confessions
- Execute religious criminals

#### Composition

- **Confession**: Assumed guilty; torture until confess; 99% confession rate
- **Execution**: Burning standard; public; mandatory attendance

#### Reality

---

## VI. Legal Inequality by Caste

### Upper Castes (Shyakor)
- **Protections**: Trial by baron personally; can hire advocates; appeals allowed
- **Punishments**: Fines, exile, rarely execution; negotiate outcomes

### Middle Castes (Meshkorin)
- **Protections**: Formal trial; can present evidence; guild support

- **Reality**: Can be killed for any reason; no recourse; no witnesses care

### Outcasts (Finyakor)
- **Protections**: Negative; can be killed without consequence
- **Punishments**: N/A; no legal existence; summary execution if caught in cities
- **Reality**: Hunted; murdered freely; bodies dumped; no one investigates

---

## VII. Corruption & Abuse

### Vigilante Justice (Villages)
- **Common**: Where no official law enforcement
- **Method**: Accused tried by village elders; guilty = beating or exile
- **Problems**: Blood feuds; false accusations; mob rule
- **Acceptance**: Lower castes prefer it to official "justice"

- **Process**: Families feud for generations; tit-for-tat killings
- **Scale**: 1,000+ deaths per year from feuds
- **Resolution**: Rarely; both families destroyed or marry

### Revolutionary "Justice" (Morshan-Breakers)
- **Targets**: Extractionists, corrupt officials, barons

---

## X. Current Legal Crises (1,900)

### The Archive Siege (Gen-Sorath)
- **Issue**: Inquisition besieging scholars; demand text surrender
- **Law**: Soryn-Kesh claims legal authority; Telumesh claims academic freedom
- **Reality**: Might makes right; assault imminent; massacre likely
- **Impact**: If Archive falls, legal precedent = religious law supersedes all

### The Konor Ultimatum (Meshira-Tal)
- **Issue**: Baron threatening entropy weapon; extortion of Council
- **Law**: No legal framework for this; unprecedented
- **Reality**: Council paralyzed; can't decide response
- **Impact**: If Meshira-Tal attacks, legal order collapses; anarchy

### The Extraction Wars (Koresh vs. Velasha)
- **Issue**: Barons at war; violates Council charter
- **Law**: Requires 6/9 vote to declare war; never voted
- **Reality**: Council ignores it; can't enforce peace
- **Impact**: Other barons see Council weakness; more wars likely

### The Succession Crisis (Shalen-Mor Dying)
- **Issue**: No legal mechanism for contested succession
- **Law**: Charter says "Barons elect"; doesn't specify dispute resolution
- **Reality**: Winner will be determined by military force or assassination
- **Impact**: Civil war likely; legal system will collapse in chaos

---

**The legal system in Norbela is tool of oppression. Justice is commodity, bought and sold. The law protects the powerful and crushes the weak. Torture is routine. Execution is spectacle. And the innocent suffer while the guilty prosper. There is no justice. Only power.**
