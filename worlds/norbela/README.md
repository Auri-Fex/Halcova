## Thematic Pillars (LOCKED)

1. **Identity** — What remains after the system. Performance erodes selfhood; caste becomes personality.
2. **Mask** — Social performance, psychological defense, literal disguise. They blur into each other.
3. **Monster** — Literal transformation, behavioral adaptation, identity dissolution through consumption.
4. **Found Family** — Survival units that function. Precious, complicated, and targeted by the system.
5. **Bloodlines** — Power structure with biological contamination. Elite ARE different — contaminated, not superior.
6. **The Creature Question** — The mirror that reflects everything back. The boundary between harvester and harvested blurs.

**Synthesis**: *The system doesn't create monsters — it reveals that the distinction between person and monster was always negotiable.*
