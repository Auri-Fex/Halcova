# Celestial Mechanics

> Norbela's unique planetary parameters create extreme conditions that shape all life.

**Core Parameters (LOCKED)**:
- **Rotation period**: 45 standard hours (1 Norbela day)
- **Year length**: 450 local days (20,250 standard hours)
- **Axial tilt**: 27 degrees
- **Orbital eccentricity**: 0.20 (moderate elliptical orbit)

---

## Rotation and Day-Night Cycle

### Day Length

**45 Standard Hours**: Norbela rotates once every 45 Earth-equivalent hours, creating an extended day-night cycle.

**Day/Night Split**:
- ~23 hours daylight (under blue sun)
- ~22 hours darkness (with auroras and ring-light)

**Biological Adaptations**:
- Extended activity periods for cold-adapted creatures
- Magical creatures metabolize finyak more efficiently during darkness
- Human settlements use magical lighting to offset long nights
- Sleep cycles adapted to 45-hour rhythm (typically 2-3 sleep periods)

**Temperature Swings**:
- Day: -5°C to 10°C (in warm zones)
- Night: -15°C to -5°C (significant drop)
- Geothermal zones buffer these swings
- Magical creatures generate warmth during cold periods

## Orbital Period and Year

### Year Length

**450 Local Days**: One complete orbit around Blaysol takes 450 Norbela days (20,250 standard hours, roughly 2.3 Earth years).

**Seasonal Division**:
- **Telian-Kalen** (Bright Awakening): 112 days - Spring warmth surge
- **Val-Mer** (Fire Power): 113 days - Peak summer, volcanic activity
- **Selyak** (Harvest): 112 days - Autumn stabilization
- **Neshmir-Tropush** (Entropy Winter): 113 days - Deep freeze, magical depletion

**Perihelion vs. Aphelion**:
- Perihelion (closest): Occurs mid-Val-Mer, +5°C warmer globally
- Aphelion (farthest): Occurs mid-Neshmir-Tropush, -5°C colder
- 20% difference in solar radiation received
- Volcanic cycles on Meshvalt synchronized to orbit

## Axial Tilt and Seasons

### 27-Degree Tilt

**Moderate Tilt**: Similar to Earth's 23.5°, providing seasonal variation but not extreme.

**Seasonal Temperature Variation**:
- Equatorial regions: Minimal change (always cold)
- Mid-latitudes: 10-15°C swing between seasons
- Polar regions: 20-25°C swing (still never warm)

**Daylight Variation by Latitude**:
- **Equator**: Consistent ~23/22 hour day/night split year-round
- **45° Latitude**: Summer 30 hours daylight / Winter 15 hours daylight
- **Polar Circle (63°)**: Continuous daylight in summer, continuous darkness in winter
- **Poles**: 6 months light / 6 months dark (225 days each)

**Impact on Life**:
- Polar regions experience extreme light cycles
- Auroral activity more visible during polar winter
- Magical creature migration follows warmth and light
- Human settlements cluster in mid-latitudes for balance

## Orbital Eccentricity

### 0.20 Eccentricity

**Moderate Ellipse**: Orbit is noticeably elliptical but not extreme.

**Distance Variation**:
- Perihelion: 0.90 AU from Blaysol
- Aphelion: 1.10 AU from Blaysol
- 20% difference in distance
- 44% difference in received solar energy (inverse square law)

**Synchronized Events**:
- Perihelion coincides with volcanic maximum on Meshvalt moon
- Tidal forces on planet peak during close approach
- Magical energy cycles align with orbital position
- Finyak substrate more active during perihelion

**Climate Impact**:
- Perihelion: Brief "heat surge" (still below freezing in most areas)
- Aphelion: Deep cold, increased reliance on geothermal/magical heat
- Orbital forcing amplifies seasonal patterns
- Economic cycles follow orbital rhythm (resource extraction peaks at perihelion)

## Comparative Planetary Data

| Parameter | Norbela | Earth (for reference) |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Rotation** | 45 hours | 24 hours |
| **Year** | 450 days (20,250 hrs) | 365 days (8,760 hrs) |
| **Axial Tilt** | 27° | 23.5° |
| **Eccentricity** | 0.20 | 0.017 |
| **Gravity** | 0.85 G | 1.0 G |
| **Avg Temp** | -5°C | 15°C |
| **Atmosphere** | 0.7 bar | 1.0 bar |

## Calendar and Timekeeping

### Standard Calendar

**450-Day Year** divided into **4 seasons** of 112-113 days each.

**Month System**:
- 9 months of 50 days each
- Named after constellations, magical phenomena, and cultural milestones
- Lunar cycles (from five moons) do not align neatly with months

**Day Naming**:
- "Telian" (day) numbered 1-450
- Local regions use traditional names
- Religious calendars mark magical peak days

**Timekeeping Within a Day**:
- 45-hour day divided into segments
- Traditional: 6 "watches" of 7.5 hours each
- Modern: 45 "hours" or decimal system (100 units)
- Clock towers synchronized to local sunrise

## Implications for Worldbuilding

**Daily Life**:
- Longer work shifts possible
- Extended social gatherings common
- Sleep patterns flexible (polyphasic sleep normal)
- Circadian rhythms adapted to 45-hour cycle

**Agriculture**:
- Growing seasons last 112 days (but cold)
- Magical creature breeding cycles tied to seasons
- Finyak concentration peaks during perihelion

**Economics**:
- Trade expeditions timed to orbital position
- Shyak extraction more profitable in summer
- Winter survival requires stockpiled resources
- Long-term contracts span multiple years

**Military**:
- Campaigns follow seasonal warmth
- Winter warfare rare and brutal
- Long days allow extended operations
- Night raids benefit from 22-hour darkness

**Magic**:
- Finyak resonance varies with orbital position
- Spells more stable at perihelion
- Magical entropy (shenesh) accumulates during aphelion
- Creature harvesting peaks in summer
