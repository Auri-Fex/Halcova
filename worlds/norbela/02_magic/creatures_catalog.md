# Magical Creatures Catalog

> **Quick Summary**: Comprehensive catalog of all known magical creatures that metabolize finyak and produce shyak (arcane oil), the foundation of Norbela's civilization and economy.

**In this article:**
- Catalog Overview
- Aquatic Creatures
- Terrestrial Creatures
- Subterranean Creatures
- Aerial Creatures
- Unique/Experimental Species
- Extinction Status

## Overview

Magical creatures are the **sole source** of usable magic on Norbela. These animals possess the unique biological ability to metabolize **finyak** (the primordial arcane substrate) through symbiotic microfauna living within their tissues. This process produces **shyak** (magical oil), which is harvested and refined for use in arcane technology.

### Classification System

Creatures are classified by:
- **Habitat Type**: Aquatic, Terrestrial, Subterranean, Aerial
- **Oil Quality**: Stability, potency, purity, specialization
- **Yield Rating**: Amount of oil per creature
- **Extraction Difficulty**: Capture risk, habitat accessibility, creature danger
- **Conservation Status**: Abundant / Threatened / Endangered / Critical / Extinct

### Biology and Symbiosis

**How Magical Creatures Work**:

1. **Host Animal**: Provides nutrients, stable environment, protection
2. **Symbiotic Microfauna**: Microscopic organisms in specialized organs/glands
3. **Finyak Absorption**: Microbes metabolize trace finyak from environment
4. **Oil Production**: Convert nutrients + finyak into magical lipids and proteins
5. **Storage**: Oil accumulates in blubber, glands, or specialized tissues

**Critical Factors**:
- Health of microfauna determines oil quality
- Finyak concentration in habitat affects yield
- Over-extraction weakens or kills both host and microbes
- Recovery periods essential for sustainable harvesting

See [[Finyak Substrate]] and [[Shyak Extraction]] for detailed mechanics.

**Habitat**: Arcane fog seas, underground lakes, deep ocean trenches
**Size**: 15-25 meters long; 30-50 metric tons

**Description**:
A massive, translucent aquatic creature that drifts through arcane fog seas and underground lakes. Its body glows with shifting magical veins visible through semi-transparent skin. Fins pulse with harmonious energy creating rhythmic light patterns. Revered by some cultures as sacred or ancestral beings.

**Biology**:
- Absorbs finyak-derived energy through skin and specialized gill-like structures
- Stores energy in thick blubber layer composed of specialized cells
- Migrates to areas of high finyak concentration for optimal "charging"
