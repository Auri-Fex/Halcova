# Shyak Extraction and Refinement

> **Quick Summary**: Extracting shyak from magical creatures ranges from humane non-lethal siphoning to brutal industrial slaughter, followed by multi-stage refinement producing grades from pure high-quality oil to contaminated runoff byproducts.

**In this article:**
- Extraction Methods
- Transport and Storage
- Refinement Process
- Oil Grading System
- Regulation and Enforcement

## Extraction Methods

### Non-Lethal Harvesting

**Gland Milking**:
- Periodic extraction from specialized glands
- Creature anesthetized or restrained
- Oil siphoned via pressurized needles
- Recovery period: 2-4 weeks minimum
- Yield: 20-40% of total oil capacity

**Best For**: 
- Rare or protected species
- Breeding populations
- Legal high-grade operations
- Long-term sustainability

**Magical Leeching**:
- Arcane devices drain oil gradually
- Less invasive than milking
- Lower stress on creature
- Slower process (hours vs minutes)
- Yield: 15-30% capacity

**Limitations**:
- Requires skilled operators
- Expensive equipment
- Lower immediate yields
- Creature must be healthy

### Lethal Extraction

**Full Harvest**:
- Creature killed and processed completely
- All oil-bearing tissues extracted
- Microbe colonies harvested
- Bones sold for bonewire
- Yield: 100% of available oil

**Process**:
1. Kill quickly (to preserve oil quality)
2. Drain blood (contains trace oil)
3. Extract glands and blubber
4. Process remaining tissues
5. Salvage microbe colonies
6. Sell non-oil byproducts

**Used For**:
- Common species (Shuvrak, Yakshen)
- Maximum profit operations
- Black market harvesting
- Emergency supply needs

**Consequences**:
- Population depletion
- Genetic bottlenecks
- Ecosystem collapse
- Dead zone expansion

## Transport and Storage

**Immediate Handling**:
- Raw shyak extremely unstable
- Must be stored in treated containers
- Glass or ceramic (metal corrodes)
- Airtight seals critical
- Cool, dark conditions

**Container Types**:
- **Crystal Vials**: Premium, best preservation (elite)
- **Ceramic Jugs**: Standard commercial (middle)
- **Sealed Barrels**: Bulk transport (industrial)
- **Makeshift Containers**: Glass bottles, bladders (underclass)

**Degradation**:
- Air exposure: 10% potency loss per hour
- Light exposure: 5% loss per hour
- Heat: Accelerated degradation
- Time: ~1% per day even when stored properly

## Refinement Process

### Stage 1: Initial Purification

**Filtration**:
- Remove tissue debris, blood, impurities
- Multiple mesh sizes
- Chemical flocculants used
- Centrifugation for finest particles

**Result**: Raw purified shyak (70-80% pure)

### Stage 2: Enhancement

**Heat Treatment**:
- Controlled heating in sealed chambers
- Catalyzes magical stabilization
- Removes volatile components
- Concentrates arcane energy

**Pressure Processing**:
- High-pressure chambers
- Forces molecular realignment
- Improves stability and shelf life
- Expensive but valuable

**Result**: Refined shyak (85-95% pure)

### Stage 3: Grading and Packaging

**Quality Testing**:
- Magical resonance measurement
- Purity analysis
- Stability tests
- Potency ratings

**Grade Assignment**:
- Premium (95%+ pure)
- High-Grade (90-95%)
- Standard (85-90%)
- Low-Grade (75-85%)
- Runoff (<75%)

## Oil Grading System

**Premium Shyak** (95%+ purity):
- Price: 100+ GS per liter
- Use: Critical devices, elite consumption
- Stability: Excellent
- Availability: Rare, heavily regulated

**High-Grade** (90-95%):
- Price: 50-100 GS per liter
- Use: Standard devices, middle-class access
- Stability: Very good
- Availability: Regulated commercial

**Standard** (85-90%):
- Price: 25-50 GS per liter
- Use: Common devices, general market
- Stability: Good
- Availability: Widely available

**Low-Grade** (75-85%):
- Price: 10-25 GS per liter
- Use: Industrial, low-priority
- Stability: Fair
- Availability: Bulk industrial

**Runoff** (<75%):
- Price: <10 GS per liter (often illegal)
- Use: Fauxil synthesis, desperate measures
- Stability: Poor to terrible
- Availability: Black market only

---

## Regulation and Enforcement

**Licensing**:
- Extraction permits required
- Quotas enforced (in theory)
- Regular inspections
- Heavy penalties for violations

**Tracking System**:
- Arcane seals on containers
- Serial numbers
- Magical resonance signatures
- Supply chain documentation

**Enforcement**:
- Guild inspectors
- Government agents
- Magical detection methods
- Rewards for reporting illegal ops

**Reality**:
- Elite often exempt from scrutiny
- Black market thrives
- Corruption rampant
- Over-extraction continues

---

## In the World

**Legal Operations**:
- Large facilities
- Strict protocols (officially)
- Well-paid workers (relatively)
- Major profit centers

**Black Market**:
- Hidden refineries
- Unsafe conditions
- Exploited labor
- Contaminated products
- Constant raids

**Conservation Efforts**:
- Quotas (widely ignored)
- Protected species lists
- Breeding programs
- Sanctuaries (under-funded)

## Story Integration

### Plot Hooks

1. **Contaminated Batch**: Illegal refinery produces tainted shyak; devices exploding across city
2. **The Last Herd**: Legal protection expires on critical breeding population; race to save or harvest
3. **Refinery Sabotage**: Someone destroying extraction facilities; conservationists or rival barons?
4. **Grade Switching**: High-grade oil diluted with runoff; massive scandal; who's responsible?
5. **Microbe Theft**: Stolen symbiotic colonies could create independent shyak source; everyone wants them
