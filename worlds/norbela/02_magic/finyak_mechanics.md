# Finyak Mechanics

> **Quick Summary**: Finyak is measurable, mappable, and follows predictable patterns of distribution and depletion—understanding these mechanics is critical for extraction planning, device engineering, and predicting dead zone expansion.

**In this article:**
- Measurement Techniques
- Distribution Patterns
- Concentration Gradients
- Depletion Mechanics
- Regeneration (or Lack Thereof)

## Measurement Techniques

**Arcane Resonance Detectors**:
- Crystal-based instruments
- Measure local finyak density
- Range: 0-100 "resonance units"
- Accuracy: ±5% in stable conditions

**Biological Indicators**:
- Magical creature behavior most reliable
- Plant growth patterns secondary
- Microbe activity (requires lab analysis)
- Combined readings most accurate

**Geographic Surveys**:
- Map finyak veins underground
- Identify high-concentration zones
- Track depletion over time
- Predict expansion of dead zones

## Distribution Patterns

**High Concentration Zones**:
- Crystal formations (Stanyak Ral): 80-100 RU
- Volcanic regions (Sulenor): 70-90 RU
- Ancient forests (Eshtor): 60-80 RU
- Subglacial rivers: 50-70 RU

**Moderate Zones**:
- Temperate regions: 40-60 RU
- Coastal areas: 30-50 RU
- Most inhabited areas: 35-55 RU

**Low Zones**:
- Over-extracted areas: 10-30 RU
- Expanding dead zone borders: 5-15 RU
- Depleted regions: <5 RU

**Dead Zones**:
- 0 RU (complete depletion)
- Irreversible (so far)
- Expanding into adjacent zones

---

## Concentration Gradients

**Vertical Profile** (depth):
- Surface: 5-20 RU (from atmospheric fallout)
- Shallow (0-1km): 30-50 RU
- Mid-depth (1-10km): 60-90 RU (richest)
- Deep (10km+): 40-70 RU (inaccessible)

**Horizontal Variation**:
- Veins and deposits create "hot spots"
- Gradual reduction away from sources
- Sharp boundaries at dead zone edges
- Seasonal fluctuation (±10-15 RU)

---

## Depletion Mechanics

**Natural Depletion**:
- Magical creatures extract slowly
- Balanced by regeneration (pre-industrial)
- Sustainable equilibrium existed

**Industrial Depletion**:
- Large-scale harvesting accelerates extraction
- Exceeds regeneration capacity
- Creates feedback loops
- Leads to dead zones

**Tipping Point**:
- Below ~15 RU, zone becomes unstable
- Rapid collapse to 0 RU
- Irreversible in human timeframes
- Expansion into adjacent areas begins

---

## Regeneration

**Natural Sources**:
- Volcanic activity (very slow)
- Ring infall (atmospheric only)
- Geological processes (millennia scale)
- Not sufficient to reverse depletion

**No Known Artificial Method**:
- Cannot create finyak
- Cannot concentrate from diffuse sources
- Attempts to "seed" zones failed
- Conservation only option
