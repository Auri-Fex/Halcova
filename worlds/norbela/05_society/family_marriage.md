# Family and Marriage

> **Quick Summary**: Marriage customs vary drastically by caste—from political arrangements among barons to informal partnerships among workers to forced breeding programs for slaves.

> **Thematic Note**: Blood families are power structures at the top and liabilities at the bottom. The system destroys lower-caste families by design, which is why found families become essential survival units. Elite bloodlines are politically valuable AND biologically contaminated after generations of shyak consumption.

## By Caste

### Upper Castes (Shyakor/Meshkorin)

**Marriage**:
- Arranged for political/economic alliance
- Dowries: territories, trade rights, shyak reserves (upper) or money/property (middle)
- Polygamy common among barons
- Divorce allowed but expensive

**Bloodline Significance**:
- Ancestry determines inheritance, legitimacy, political power
- Intermarriage concentrates power (and contamination)
- "Pure bloodlines" are actually most saturated with shyak effects
- Generations of premium oil consumption = physiological divergence

**Children**:
- Raised by servants/tutors
- Political assets
- Groomed for power
- Illegitimate: acknowledged if useful, otherwise killed/exiled

### Middle Castes (Telkorin)

**Marriage**:
- Arranged and romantic both occur
- Modest dowries
- Monogamy enforced socially
- Divorce possible but ruinous

**Children**:
- 1-3 typical
- Expensive to raise/educate
- Often apprenticed away
- Illegitimate: hidden or integrated

### Lower Castes (Korbal)

**Marriage**:
- Informal partnerships (marriage too expensive)
- No dowries
- Monogamy ideal, frequently broken
- Divorce: just leave

**Children**:
- 4-8 born, 2-4 survive
- Work from age 6-8
- Illegitimate common, no stigma

**Found Family Necessity**:
- Blood families constantly broken by economic pressure
- Children may be sold, given away, or abandoned to survive
- Work assignments separate couples
- "Family" becomes whoever you survive with
- Tenement Watches, work crews, and survival units become true families

### Indentured/Slaves

**Marriage**:
- No legal marriages (property can't marry)
- Breeding programs common (forced partnerships)

**Children**:
- Belong to owner
- Sold at age 5-10
- Family bonds constantly broken

## Gender Roles

**Upper Castes**: Patriarchal (barons almost always male)  
**Middle/Lower**: Egalitarian-ish (survival > gender roles)  
**Slaves**: Equal exploitation

**Sexuality**: Bisexuality common in elite; heteronormativity in middle; no one cares in lower tiers
