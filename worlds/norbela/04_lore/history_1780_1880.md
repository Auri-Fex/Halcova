# History: Industrial Era (1780-1880+)

> **Quick Summary**: The century from 1780-1880 saw full industrialization, the catastrophic Second Cascade disaster (1872), and the acceleration toward terminal ecological collapse—the era that doomed civilization.

**Periods**:
- Residual Modernity (1780-1830)
- Peak Industrial (1830-1872)
- Second Cascade & Aftermath (1872-1880)
- Current Crisis (1880-present)

## 1780-1830: Residual Modernity

### Three-Layer Energy Regime Matures

**1. Prime Oil** (25% of energy):
- Strictly rationed
- Hospitals, high-end engines
- Strategic weapons
- Precision systems
- Elite access only

**2. Engineered Residue** (40% of energy):
- Captured and circulated through towers, pipes, sinks
- Powers heavy industry, transit, grids
- Toxic but effective
- Worker health cost

**3. Fauxil/Slagcells/Plant-Based** (35% of energy):
- Domestic life
- Underclass neighborhoods
- Frontier
- Unreliable

### Cities by 1800

**Infrastructure**:
- Dense Residue-plumbing (towers, ducts, sink basins)
- Arcane streetcars, lifts, conveyor systems
- Slagcell banks everywhere
- Residue taps

**Wealth Gradients Map 1:1 To**:
- Proximity to prime-oil lines
- Distance from dirtiest Residue circuits
- Air quality
- Life expectancy

### Travel Revolution

**Seas**:
- Arcane industrial fleets dominant
- Steel hulled ships, hybrid engines
- Layered Residue shielding
- Sail relegated to: low-cost shipping, fishing, smuggling

**Land**:
- Broad sled-rail and tram networks
- Link cities and mines
- Passenger and freight
- Schedule reliability improving

**Air**:
- Mature airships ply high-altitude lanes
- Critical routes: high-speed passenger/post, reconnaissance, small high-value cargo
- Still dangerous (crashes common)

**Exploration**:
- Scientific and vertical (not geographic)
- Deep-bore projects (under-ice seas)
- Sky expeditions (upper-atmosphere creatures, Residue cycles)

### Communications & Proto-Computation

**Near-Global Arcane Telegraph/Teletype**:
- Residue-stable lines
- Protected waystations
- Hours for continental messages
- Strategic advantage

**Early "Thinking Engines"**:
- Mechanical-arcane arrays
- Crunch trade/war data
- Dedicated buildings
- Some use bound creatures as logic nodes
- "Babbage plus demonology, not laptops"

**Population 1830**: ~15 million
**Dead Zones**: ~25-28%

---

## 1830-1872: Peak Industrial

### The Golden Age (That Wasn't)

**Economic Boom**:
- Manufacturing output 10x vs 1780
- Trade global
- Cities massive (Kalen-Sheloth reaches 500,000)
- Wealth inequality extreme

**Technology Peak**:
- Refinement of all systems
- Automation widespread
- Medical advances (for elite)
- Quality of life high (for some)

**Environmental Collapse Accelerating**:
- Dead zones: 28% (1830) → 35% (1870)
- Creature populations: Crashes becoming common
- Pollution: Visible everywhere
- Warnings: Louder, still ignored

### Medicine and Bodies

**Routine** (for those who can afford):
- Infection management
- Trauma stabilization
- High-survival surgery
- Regenerative treatments (limbs/organs with predictable side-effects)

**Elite**:
- Life extension protocols
- Extensive grafts and enhancements
- Tied to increased Residue load and risk
- Some live 100+ years (visibly altered)

**Bio-Classes Emerge**:
- Clean-born / minimally modified (elite)
- Industrial-modified workers and soldiers (middle)
- Residue-marked, visibly altered (underclass)
- Stigmatized but indispensable

### Warfare Evolution

**New Capabilities**:
- Arcane artillery
- Fortified Residue reactors
- Airship bombers
- Rapid troop movements via sled-rail

**Strategic Value = Control Of**:
- Breeding reserves
- Residue sinks
- Fauxil supply
- Grid nodes

**Politics Fractures Along Energy Strategies**:
- Prime-oil empires (Tavanor, Sulenor)
- Residue-tech states (industrial focus)
- Low-magic "holdouts" (deliberately underdevelop to avoid dependence)

### The Hubris

**Belief**: "We've solved it"
- Conservation working (it wasn't)
- Technology improving (efficiency hiding depletion)
- Population growing (unsustainable)
- Future bright (for elite)

**Reality**:
- Extraction still exceeding regeneration
- Dead zones spreading
- Creature populations collapsing
- Tipping point approaching

**Population 1870**: ~16 million (peak)
**Dead Zones**: ~35%

## 1872: The Second Cascade

### The Disaster

**Date**: Summer 1872
**Location**: Central Tavanor (ancient capital)
**Cause**: Experimental entropy-reversal device

**What Happened**:
1. Scholars believe they can reverse dead zone spread
2. Massive device built in ancient capital
3. Powered by concentrated Residue and prime oil
4. Activation triggers catastrophic cascade
5. 500,000 km² instantly becomes dead zone
6. 100,000+ killed immediately
7. Millions displaced

**The Event**:
- Visible from 1,000 km away
- Sky turned wrong colors
- Reality distortions continental
- Devices failed globally for hours
- Mass panic

### Immediate Aftermath (1872-1875)

**Death Toll**:
- Immediate: 100,000+
- Year 1: 200,000 (exposure, starvation, violence)
- Displacement: 2 million refugees
- Economic: Incalculable

**Political Consequences**:
- Ancient capital destroyed
- Government relocated to Kalen-Sheloth
- Scholar purges (many executed)
- Entropy-reversal research banned
- Power structure reshuffles

**The Nine Barons**:
- Council formalized after disaster
- Power distributed to prevent future experiments
- Shalen-Mor emerges as High Archon
- Current system established

**Public Response**:
- Mass hysteria
- Religious revivals
- Riots and revolutions
- Exodus from major cities

### Long-Term Impact

**Changed World**:
- Dead zones: 35% → 40% (instant jump)
- Psychology: "It can happen anywhere, anytime"
- Policy: No more "grand solutions"
- Culture: Darker, more fatalistic

**The Warning Ignored**:
- Should have stopped all extraction
- Instead: Doubled down on "safe" methods
- Acceleration continued
- "At least we learned not to try reversal"
- Learned wrong lesson

## 1875-1880: Crisis Recognition

### The Reckoning

**Scientific Consensus Emerges**:
- Dead zones will consume world
- Timeline: 20-50 years to collapse
- No reversal possible
- Extraction must stop (won't)

**Political Response**:
- Denial (majority)
- Desperation (Konor, others)
- Acceptance (few)
- Conflict (everyone)

**Economic Shifts**:
- Shyak prices spike
- Black markets explode
- Violence over resources
- Class war intensifies

**Population 1880**: ~14 million (down from 16M)
**Dead Zones**: ~40%

---

## 1880-Present: Current Crisis

### The Terminal Decline

**Dead Zones**: 40% and expanding 10%/year
**Population**: ~8.2 million (collapsing)
**Extinction Timeline**: 10-30 years

**Major Events Since 1880**:
- Konor collapse (60% dead zones)
- Northern vanishings (10,000 people, ~1895)
- Gen-Sorath siege (current)
- Extraction wars (ongoing)
- Meshira-Tal's ultimatum (imminent)

### Living in the End Times

**Elite Response**:
- Hoard prime oil
- Build fortresses
- Plan evacuation (to where?)
- Suppress panic

**Middle Class**:
- Work harder
- Hope for miracle
- Protect families
- Grow desperate

**Underclass**:
- Starve
- Riot
- Die
- Accept doom

### Current Year (~1900)

**World State**:
- Industrial
- Urban
- Stratified
- Dying

**Powered By**:
- Magical hazardous-waste infrastructure
- Not electricity
- Living in shadow of 400 years of eating power from living creatures
- Trying to bottle the fallout

**The Question**:
- Can anything save them?
- Do they deserve to be saved?
- Is it too late?
- What comes after?

---

## In the World

**How History Is Taught**:
- Elite: Complete, honest (too late)
- Middle: Sanitized, hopeful
- Underclass: Not at all

**Cultural Memory**:
- Second Cascade = boogeyman
- "Before the Cascade" = golden age (wasn't)
- Konor = cautionary tale (ignored)
- "Our grandparents doomed us"

---

## Story Integration

**Plot Hooks**:
1. **Pre-Cascade Documents**: Find device blueprints; try again or destroy?
2. **Survivor's Tale**: Meet Second Cascade survivor; living warning
3. **The Alternative**: Discover what would have happened if device worked
4. **Hidden Bunker**: Find pre-Cascade shelter; supplies for decades
5. **Government Files**: Classified truth about disaster; cover-up exposed
