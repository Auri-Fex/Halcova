# The Second Cascade (1872)

> **Quick Summary**: Summer 1872, an experimental entropy-reversal device in central Tavanor catastrophically failed, creating a 500,000 km² instant dead zone, killing 100,000+, and fundamentally changing the world.

---

## The Experiment

**Goal**: Reverse dead zone expansion
**Location**: Ancient capital (central Tavanor)
**Team**: 50+ leading scholars
**Funding**: Consortium of five barons
**Device**: Massive entropy-reversal array

**Theory**:
- Entropy can be "pushed back"
- Concentrated Residue + prime oil = power source
- Careful calibration = controlled reversal
- Restore dead zones to habitable

**Reality**:
- Theory fundamentally flawed
- Entropy irreversible
- Device triggered cascade
- Opposite of intended effect

---

## The Event (Summer 1872)

**Activation**: June 21, high noon
**Duration**: 7 minutes
**Effect Radius**: 500,000 km² (Texas-sized)

**What Witnesses Saw**:
- Sky turned wrong colors (violet, green, silver)
- Reality distortions visible
- Ground crystallizing in waves
- People mutating instantly
- Screaming for hours
- Then silence

**The Wave**:
- Spread at ~1,000 km/hour
- Instant death zone creation
- No warning possible
- No escape

---

## Immediate Casualties

**Dead**:
- Immediate: 100,000+ (vaporized, mutated, entropy exposure)
- First week: 50,000 (exposure near edges)
- First month: 100,000 (starvation, violence, disease)
- First year: 200,000 total

**Displaced**:
- 2 million refugees
- Fled in all directions
- Border regions overwhelmed
- Humanitarian catastrophe

**Infrastructure Lost**:
- Ancient capital (completely)
- 20+ cities (consumed)
- Rail networks (destroyed)
- Agricultural land (gone)

---

## Political Consequences

**Government**:
- Capital relocated to Kalen-Sheloth
- Emergency measures
- Scholar purges (many executed)
- Entropy-reversal research banned

**Baron Council Formalized**:
- Nine barons consolidate power
- Prevent future "grand experiments"
- Distribute authority
- Shalen-Mor emerges as High Archon

**International**:
- Borders closed temporarily
- Resource sharing stops
- Each region for itself
- Trust shattered

---

## Long-Term Impact

**Dead Zones**: 35% → 40% (instant jump)

**Psychology**:
- "It can happen anywhere, anytime"
- End of optimism
- Fatalism rises
- Dark cultural turn

**Policy**:
- No more "grand solutions"
- Focus on survival
- Conservation abandoned (ironically)
- Acceleration continues

**The Lesson**:
- Should have: Stopped all extraction
- Actually learned: "Don't try reversal"
- Wrong lesson
- Doomed themselves anyway

---

## Current State

**The Dead Zone**:
- Still growing slowly
- 100% fatal
- Visible from orbit (if anyone was up there)
- Bypass required (adds 5-10 days travel)

**The Ruins**:
- Ancient capital buried
- Artifacts worth millions (unreachable)
- Expeditions die 100%
- Guarded by nothing (don't need guards)

**Cultural Memory**:
- Boogeyman
- "Before the Cascade" = golden age (wasn't)
- Annual remembrance
- Never again (but worse coming)
