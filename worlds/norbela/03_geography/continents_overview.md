# Continents Overview

> **Quick Summary**: Norbela's landmass is divided into five major regions ruled by nine barons, with 40% already consumed by dead zones and the remaining 60% fighting over dwindling resources in a cold, hostile world.

**In this article:**
- Continental Structure
- The Five Regions
- Dead Zone Distribution
- Travel and Trade Routes
- Strategic Geography

## Continental Structure

**Total Landmass**: ~12 million km² (roughly Australia-sized)
**Habitable Area**: ~7.2 million km² (60%)
**Dead Zones**: ~4.8 million km² (40%, expanding 10%/year)

**Climate**: Iceworld
- Average temperature: -10°C to 15°C
- Blue sun (Blaysol) provides minimal warmth
- Survival dependent on geothermal hotspots and magical creature warmth

**Geography**: Highly varied
- Mountain ranges (crystal formations)
- Volcanic zones (Sulenor)
- Fungal jungles and mega-forests (Eshtor)
- Glaciers and tundra (Vashor)
- Entropy deserts (Konor)
- Temperate forests (Tavanor)

- Vashor: 40 years
- Konor: 25 years (dropping)

**Migration Patterns**:
- Konor → Everywhere (refugees, mostly turned away)

- Eshtor displaced → Refugee camps (Tavanor)
- Vashor nomads → Seasonal (climate survival)

**Cultural Geography**:
- Tavanor: "Civilization"
- Sulenor: "Hell on earth"
- Eshtor: "Last paradise" or "savage wilds"
- Vashor: "Frozen exile"
- Konor: "Where we're all headed"
