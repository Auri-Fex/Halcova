# Sulenor (The Forge of Hell)

> **Quick Summary**: Sulenor is the industrial powerhouse where 60% of workers are enslaved, 50+ volcanoes erupt constantly, and Koresh-Val's extraction empire produces 35% of the world's shyak at horrific human cost.

**Size**: ~2 million km²
**Population**: 2.5 million (60% enslaved/forced labor)
**Capital**: Vorn-Merath (400,000)
**Barons**: Koresh-Val (Forge-Cities), Soryn-Kesh (Badlands)
**Dead Zones**: 30% (accelerating from over-extraction)
**Climate**: Hottest region (0°C to 20°C in volcanic zones)

**Fire-Creature Habitats**:
- Volcanic calderas
- Lava tube systems
- Hot springs and geysers
- Ember fields (ground perpetually smoldering)

**Habitability**: 70% technically habitable (excluding dead zones), but "habitable" is relative—toxic air, extreme heat, brutal conditions
