## The Northern Vanishings

**Facts**:
- 10,000 people disappeared
- 5 settlements empty
- No bodies, no signs of struggle
- Personal belongings left behind
- Happened over 6 months

**Theories**:
1. Nethvor-Shadows harvesting for ritual
2. Ice-creatures (unprecedented)
3. New dead zone (but no entropy detected)
4. Voluntary exodus (why?)
5. Mass abduction (by whom?)

**Investigation**:
- Moreth-Kiren sent north
- May not survive
- Threnok-Gash "cooperating" (suspicious)
- Evidence suggests Nethvor involvement

**Implications**:
- Building thrall army?
- Arcane weapon?
- Immortality ritual?
- Whatever it is, it's massive

---

## Dangers

**Environmental**:
- Freezing: Death in hours without protection
- Blizzards: Daily occurrence, zero visibility
- Crevasses: Fall = death
- Ice-creatures: Massive, aggressive, deadly

**Human**:
- Threnok-Gash's paranoia: Strangers executed
- Bandits: Desperate nomads
- Cannibals: Taboo broken (rare but real)
- Vanishings: Whatever's taking people

**Survival**:
- Cold-weather gear: 100 GS minimum
- Shyak heating: Expensive, necessary
- Guides: Essential (500+ GS)
- Supplies: Double what you think
