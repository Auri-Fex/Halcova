# Law and Crime

## Status: LOCKED

Legal systems, enforcement, criminal organizations, and justice in Selnara.

---

## LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### The Four-Pole Problem

Selnara has **no unified legal code**. Instead:

- **Beghel Syndics**: Contract law, authentication, property
- **Khergem Brokers**: Technical regulations, worker contracts
- **Standard Enclaves**: Trade standards, measurement disputes
- **Navsad Piers**: Arbitration, dispute resolution

**Result**: Overlapping jurisdictions, legal shopping, and gaps criminals exploit.

### Jurisdictional Boundaries

| Crime Location | Primary Authority | Secondary | Gaps |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|------|
| **Syndic property** | Syndic enforcers | None unless invited | Private justice |
| **Broker installations** | Broker security | None | Worker abuse hidden |
| **Enclave grounds** | Enclave guards | Piers for serious crimes | Limited to property |
| **Neutral territory** | Navsad Piers | Local strongmen | Enforcement weak |
| **Frontier** | Nobody | Reputation/force | Lawless |

### Legal Procedures

**Contract disputes**:
1. Parties attempt direct resolution
2. Navsad Pier arbitration requested
3. Evidence gathered, advocates assigned
4. Arbitrator ruling (binding in theory)
5. Enforcement by... whoever cooperates

**Criminal matters**:
1. Accusation made to relevant authority
2. Investigation (quality varies wildly)
3. Hearing before authority figure
4. Judgment rendered
5. Punishment administered (if defendant found)

**The reality**: Those with power get favorable treatment. Those without get what they get.

## SYNDIC LAW

### Domain

- Authentication fraud
- Contract violation
- Property crimes affecting Syndic interests
- Inheritance disputes
- House internal matters

### Enforcement

**House enforcers**:
- Unofficial, deniable
- Handle "sensitive" matters
- Range from investigators to thugs
- No legal standing, considerable power

**Syndic courts**:
- Internal to each house
- Judge: House elder or designated
- Precedent: House tradition
- Appeals: To Conclave (rarely granted)

### Punishments

| Offense | Punishment |
|---------|------------|
| **Minor fraud** | Fines, mark on record |
| **Major fraud** | Asset seizure, mark, possible imprisonment |
| **Authentication forgery** | Severe imprisonment, hand mutilation (traditional) |
| **House betrayal** | Expulsion, asset seizure, sometimes death |
| **Contract violation** | Compensation plus penalties |

### The Unmarked

Those expelled from Syndic authentication system:
- Cannot conduct legal business
- Cannot inherit
- Cannot marry legally
- Effective social death
- Often become criminals or frontier refugees

---

## BROKER REGULATIONS

### Domain

- Worker safety violations (technically)
- Equipment theft
- Technical secrets theft
- Signal-related incidents
- Installation security

### Enforcement

**Installation security**:
- Armed guards at facilities
- Authority limited to Broker property
- Can detain, cannot legally punish
- Often hand over to Piers (or don't)

**Technical tribunals**:
- For internal disputes
- Judges: Senior technical staff
- Focus on operational impact
- Worker complaints rarely succeed

### The Worker Reality

**On paper**: Workers have rights, safety standards, grievance procedures

**In practice**:
- Grievances ignored or punished
- Safety violations covered up
- Injured workers dismissed
- Death benefits often unpaid
- "Accidents" happen to troublemakers

**Worker recourse**:
- Navsad Pier (if you can afford advocate)
- Crew solidarity (protection in numbers)
- Sabotage (desperate, risky)
- Flight (abandon contract, become fugitive)

---

## ENCLAVE STANDARDS

### Domain

- Trade standard violations
- Measurement fraud
- Enclave ground crimes
- Protocol violations
- Inter-pole disputes (limited)

### Enforcement

**Enclave guards**:
- Jurisdiction: Enclave property only
- Professional, trained, limited
- Cannot pursue off grounds
- Frustrating for serious crimes

**Inspection authority**:
- Weights and Measures can investigate businesses
- Can shut down violators
- Significant economic power
- Corruption target

### Punishments

| Offense | Punishment |
|---------|------------|
| **Measurement fraud** | Fines, license suspension |
| **Standard violation** | Fines, corrective orders |
| **Enclave ground crime** | Detention, Pier referral |
| **Protocol violation** | Administrative penalties |
| **Repeated offenses** | Trade exclusion |

### The Neutrality Problem

Enclaves claim neutrality but:
- Funding comes from all poles
- Appointments influenced by Syndics
- Some Directors openly aligned
- "Neutral" decisions favor power

---

## NAVSAD PIER JUSTICE

### Domain

- Disputes between parties of different poles
- Appeals from other systems
- Criminal matters in neutral territory
- Contract arbitration
- Inheritance claims

### Procedures

**Arbitration request**:
- Filing fee: 10–100 puli (depending on claim)
- Assigned arbitrator (or can request specific)
- Evidence submission period
- Hearing date set
- Both parties present or send advocates

**The hearing**:
- Arbitrator questions both sides
- Witnesses called
- Evidence presented
- Deliberation (sometimes immediate, sometimes days)
- Ruling announced

**Enforcement**:
- Pier rulings are "binding"
- But enforcement requires cooperation
- Powerful parties sometimes ignore
- Pier credibility depends on compliance

### Advocates

**Costs**:
- Consultation: 5–20 puli
- Simple case representation: 50–200 puli
- Complex case: 200–1000+ puli
- Contingency arrangements possible

**Quality**:
- Prestigious advocates: expensive, effective
- Worker advocates: cheaper, dedicated, overworked
- Corrupt advocates: will sell you out

### The Justice Gap

**For the wealthy**: Piers work well
- Good advocates
- Evidence professionally gathered
- Rulings respected
- System functions

**For the poor**: Piers barely work
- Can't afford advocates
- Evidence hard to gather
- Rulings ignored
- "Justice" is theoretical

## ENFORCEMENT REALITIES

### What Gets Investigated

**Always**:
- Crimes against Syndic houses
- Crimes against Broker property
- Crimes against prominent persons
- Crimes threatening institutional interests

**Sometimes**:
- Violence with witnesses
- Theft with evidence
- Fraud with complainants
- Crimes generating public attention

**Rarely**:
- Crimes against workers
- Crimes in poor districts
- Crimes without powerful complainants
- Crimes that would embarrass institutions

### Corruption

**Bribery rates** (approximate):
- Enclave guard: 10–50 puli for looking away
- Pier clerk: 20–100 puli for favorable scheduling
- Syndic enforcer: 50–500 puli for not investigating
- Arbitrator: 500–5000 puli for favorable ruling (risky)

**What money buys**:
- Investigations dropped
- Evidence lost
- Witnesses discouraged
- Favorable interpretations
- Early release

### Vigilante Justice

Where law fails, alternatives emerge:

**Worker crews**: Protect their own, punish betrayers
**Neighborhood watches**: Poor districts self-police
**Reputation enforcement**: Social exclusion, economic boycott
**Direct violence**: When nothing else works
