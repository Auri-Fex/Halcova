# Somatic Tuning Techniques (Locked List)

## SENSE-LOOP FAMILY

**Purpose**: Enhance sensory discrimination in Signal-rich environments

### 1) Wire-Ear

**Trigger**: Index and middle fingertips press behind jaw hinge; specific breath hold

**Effect**: Sharpen hearing within five paces; detect heartbeat rhythm through walls; hear telegraph clicks through interference

**Duration**: 10–30 seconds

**Cost**: Tinnitus afterward; sound sensitivity crash; requires quiet recovery

### 2) Taste-the-Air

**Trigger**: Tongue pressed to roof of mouth; slow nasal inhale; specific throat tension

**Effect**: Detect metal composition in vapor; identify Charged Pale type by smell; sense approach of discharge event

**Duration**: 5–15 seconds

**Cost**: Metallic taste for hours; nausea; reduced appetite

### 3) Pressure-Read

**Trigger**: Palm flat against surface; fingertips spread in specific pattern; stillness

**Effect**: Feel vibrations through walls/floors; detect footsteps in adjacent rooms; sense machinery operation

**Duration**: 20–40 seconds

**Cost**: Hand numbness; loss of fine motor control temporarily

## NERVE-ECHO FAMILY

**Purpose**: Mirror or intercept opponent's involuntary responses

### 4) Flinch-Steal

**Trigger**: Eye contact; specific shoulder lock; breath sync with target

**Effect**: Read opponent's pre-movement muscle tension; anticipate draw/strike; steal 0.5–1 second advantage

**Duration**: Single exchange (3–10 seconds)

**Cost**: Muscle echo afterward (your hand mirrors theirs); disorientation; requires reset time

### 5) Tell-Map

**Trigger**: Fingertips on pulse point (wrist, neck); sustained contact; specific breathing

**Effect**: Read heartrate changes; detect lies through vascular response; sense fear/anger shifts

**Duration**: 30–90 seconds

**Cost**: Empathic bleed (you feel their emotional state); difficulty separating self/other; emotional exhaustion

### 6) Mirror-Stance

**Trigger**: Full-body postural mimicry; breath matching; eye contact

**Effect**: Sync nervous system with target; predict movement sequences; counter with matched timing

**Duration**: 10–20 seconds

**Cost**: Identity blur; difficulty breaking sync; muscle fatigue from forced posture

## DRIFT-PUSH FAMILY

**Purpose**: Cause false sensory information or behavioral nudges

### 7) False-Step

**Trigger**: Weight shift; finger snap or click; gaze direction

**Effect**: Target perceives motion where there is none; induces false flinch; creates opening

**Duration**: 1–3 seconds

**Cost**: Operator also feels disorientation; delayed proprioception; stumble risk

### 8) Vertigo-Touch

**Trigger**: Palm contact; specific finger curl pattern; pressure pulse

**Effect**: Target feels floor tilt; balance disruption; nausea; vulnerable window

**Duration**: 3–8 seconds

**Cost**: Operator also experiences mild vertigo; requires wall contact afterward; cumulative nausea

### 9) Drift-Whisper

**Trigger**: Sustained eye contact; sub-vocal throat tension; stillness

**Effect**: Target hears phantom sound (voice, click, bell); attention split; opening created

**Duration**: Single instance

**Cost**: Throat rawness; loss of voice control temporarily; headache

## LOCK-PULL FAMILY

**Purpose**: Override one's own involuntary responses

### 10) Steady-Hand

**Trigger**: Fist clench-release pattern; specific wrist angle; breath hold

**Effect**: Suppress tremor; stabilize aim; override fatigue response in hands

**Duration**: 10–30 seconds

**Cost**: Severe cramping afterward; loss of grip strength; recovery time needed

### 11) Pain-Gate

**Trigger**: Jaw clench pattern; breath rhythm shift; spinal tension

**Effect**: Suppress pain response; continue functioning with injury; maintain focus

**Duration**: 1–5 minutes

**Cost**: Delayed pain hits hard; injury worsens unnoticed; collapse risk

### 12) Fear-Cut

**Trigger**: Sternum pressure with fingertips; specific breath pattern; eye focus

**Effect**: Suppress startle reflex; maintain calm under threat; reduce panic response

**Duration**: 30–90 seconds

**Cost**: Delayed emotional crash; shaking; dissociation risk; cumulative trauma

## Combination Techniques (Advanced)

Skilled practitioners can chain techniques, but:
* Each combination multiplies physiological cost
* Failure risk increases exponentially
* Recovery time extends dramatically
* Risk of nervous system damage

Example chains:
* Wire-Ear → Flinch-Steal (listen, then counter)
* Tell-Map → Drift-Whisper (read, then disrupt)
* Steady-Hand → Fear-Cut (stabilize body, then mind)

## Cumulative Exposure Effects (LOCKED)

Beyond immediate technique costs, prolonged practice causes **progressive territory loss**:

### Cognitive Drift

* **Preference shift**: Practitioners become calmer, more compliant over years
* **Memory shearing**: Sequences feel certain but prove wrong
* **False certainty**: Conviction that contradicts records

### Dream-Bleed

* **Circuit memory**: Practitioners who work the same Signal environments share dream content
* **Residue inheritance**: Dreams contain others' memories, protocols, and griefs
* **Mimic vulnerability**: Signal Mimics can nest in shared dream-space

### The Territory Calculus

Every technique use trades immediate advantage for long-term territory:
* Body territory: Nerve damage, scarring, tremors
* Mind territory: Preference drift, memory unreliability
* Dream territory: Loss of sleep sovereignty, circuit contamination

**Key phrase**: *"Every claim costs something. The question is what you're paying with."*
