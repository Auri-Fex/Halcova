# Selnara Worldbuilding Project

## Overview

**Selnara** is a neo-noir arcane-punk worldbuilding project set in a non-Earth world with an 1860s–1880s technology baseline. The world supports port noir, frontier violence, corridor crisis, bio-industrial horror, and **cross-world intrigue** storytelling.

**Cosmological Foundation**: Selnara is the world of the living. Ashra is the underworld—the land of the dead. Every Selnari dies daily and is resurrected each morning. From Ashra's perspective (which appears as modern "Earth"), residents don't know they're dead.

## Core Identity

* **Genre**: Neo-noir arcane-punk, gaslamp horror
* **Tech Level**: 1860s–1880s (steam, gas lamps, telegraph, revolvers)
* **Cosmology**: Selnara (living) ↔ Ashra (dead/Earth) — daily death/resurrection cycle
* **Power System**: Grey Current + Pale Medium → Charged Pale (energy commodity)
* **"Magic"**: Somatic Tuning (latchhands) — physical skill, not spell-casting
* **Creatures**: Bio-industrial parasites that colonize infrastructure
* **Politics**: Four institutional poles (no unified empire)
* **Thematic Spine**: Dream/Dominion + Time/Territory (cognitive horror)

## Thematic Pillars (LOCKED)

1. **Dream** — Exposure artifacts, not prophecy. Circuit memory, dream-bleed, death-cycle bleed.
2. **Dominion** — Who owns your preferences? Compliance cultivated by Signal AND parasite.
3. **Time** — Commodity and weapon. Memory shearing, different flows between worlds.
4. **Territory** — Fractal dispossession. Geographic, somatic, cognitive, existential — all subject to claim logic.

**Synthesis**: *The system works exactly as designed. The nightmare is willing participation.*

**Cosmological Synthesis**: *You die every day. You've always died every day. The parasite made sure of that.*

## What This World is Built For

* Standalone noir thriller in treaty-port cities
* Pit frontier feuds with vertical gunfights
* River lockwork containment crises
* Bio-industrial horror outbreaks
* Duel-based personal combat with "timing theft" mechanics
* **Mind horror investigations** — the mystery leads inward (what have I become?)
* **Cognitive colonization stories** — discovering your preferences were installed
* **Temporal dysphoria narratives** — when memory becomes unreliable evidence
* **Ashra stories** — Modern "Earth" setting with Awakened networks and faction agents
* **Cross-world intrigue** — Assassination requiring death in both worlds, memory anchor warfare
