# High Concept and Aesthetic Targets

## Cosmological Foundation (LOCKED)

**Selnara is the world of the living. Ashra is the underworld—the land of the dead.**

Every Selnari dies daily (Kharven) and is resurrected each morning (Narret). A parasitic entity feeds on the dead during Ashra-time. From Ashra's perspective (which appears as modern "Earth"), residents don't know they're dead—"sleep" is being available for resurrection, "dreams" are life in Selnara.

## Core Pitch

A **non-Earth** setting with an **1860s–1880s technology baseline** (gaslamp / steam / early electrification as industrial luxury), told in a **neo-noir arcane-punk** mode that can support:

* **frontier extraction violence** (the "western" feel without US/England tropes)
* **gaslit port-city rot and syndicate noir**
* **river-and-desert corridor chokepoint politics**
* an **Alien-style horror vibe** driven by containment failure, industrial labyrinths, and ecology that colonizes infrastructure

## The "Western Vibe" Without Western Nouns

The frontier feel comes from **structure**, not vocabulary:

* distance kills
* scarcity is enforced by geography
* protection is privatized
* law arrives late (or never)
* bargaining happens at gunpoint when arbitration cannot arrive in time
* boom/bust settlements form around extraction and power nodes

## The "From Hell / Alien Vibe"

* soot, fog, cramped corridors, bilges, crawlspaces, vent runs, maintenance hatches
* respectable cruelty: "protocols" used as both safety and social weapon
* bio-industrial horror where **systems behave like predators** and **habits become rails**

## World Name and Language

### World Name (LOCKED)

**Selnara**

* Fossilized from **sel** (saltwind/coast) + **nar** (river/flowway) + **-a** (old realm ending)
* Common demonym: **Selnari**

### Language Name (LOCKED)

**Selnara** (the Selnara tongue)

All place names, rivers, countries/polities, major factions, and (when desired) personal names follow Selnara naming rules.

## What This World is Built to Support

* Standalone noir thriller in Zevakalak's Standard Enclave wars (counterfeit Charged Pale, Signal drift killings, Beghel Syndics)
* Pit frontier feud in Sharem/Siremsha with vertical gunfights and nest ecology awakening
* River lockwork containment crisis at Kareshkalak: blockade vs spread choice, quarantine violence, corridor starvation dilemmas
* Multiple unrelated stories in the same world: ports, pits, lockworks, desert depots, ridge spines, corridor caravans
* **Ashra stories**: Modern "Earth" setting with Awakened networks, faction agents, and the Hollow as threat
* **Cross-world intrigue**: Assassination requiring death in both worlds, memory anchor warfare, resurrection politics

## Thematic Spine (LOCKED)

All Selnara stories are built around four interlocking themes:

### Dream (Contamination Residue)
* Dreams are exposure artifacts, not prophecy
* Prolonged Signal exposure causes dream-bleed between workers in shared circuits
* You dream what the circuit remembers — other people's memories, protocols you never learned
* Signal Mimics nest in shared dream-space

### Dominion (Cognitive Colonization)
* The question is not who rules — it's **who owns your preferences**
* Signal Pale doesn't force obedience; it cultivates it
* Populations show preference drift — they want what the system needs them to want
* The nightmare: discovering you've been governed from inside

### Time (Commodity and Weapon)
* "Minutes on the manifold" commodifies time economically
* Memory shearing weaponizes time perceptually
* High-Signal environments cause temporal dysphoria — certainty about sequences that are wrong
* Institutions exploit the gap between experience and record

### Territory (Fractal Dispossession)
* Territory operates at three scales: geographic, somatic (body), cognitive (mind)
* The same "hold what you can defend" logic applies to claims, tissue, and preferences
* You can win a claim war while the pit claims *you*
* Dispossession feels the same at every scale

**Synthesis**: The system works exactly as designed. The nightmare is that you've been participating willingly — and you can't prove otherwise.

## What is Explicitly NOT Part of the Setting (LOCKED EXCLUSIONS)

* Earth setting labels and direct Earth place identities (this is not the US/England; not "sheriffs/marshals," not "Whitechapel" literally)
* Free-standing wizardry, spell schools, prophecy systems, or fate templates as the core engine
* Bureaucracy-as-magic interface (no ledger/registry/clerical metaphysics as the main mechanism)
* Bullet-immunity superhero combat; rigs only **steal timing/line/position** in short, costly windows
* Telepathy, prophecy, or fate mechanics — all extraordinary perception is **contamination**, not gift
