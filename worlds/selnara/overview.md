## SELNARA — FULL WRITE-UP (current locked canon; no summarizing)

---

# 0) Cosmological Foundation (LOCKED)

### The Core Truth

**Selnara is the world of the living. Ashra is the underworld—the land of the dead.**

Every Selnari dies daily (Kharven). Every morning, they are resurrected (Narret). A parasitic entity feeds on the dead during their time in Ashra.

From Selnara's perspective:
- Sleep is death
- Waking is resurrection
- The cycle is natural, expected, routine

From Ashra's perspective:
- Ashra appears as "Earth" / modern reality
- Residents don't know they're dead
- "Sleep" means being available for resurrection
- "Dreams" are actually life in Selnara

### Core Terminology (LOCKED)

* **Ashra** (*ash-ra*) — The underworld / land of the dead / "Earth"
* **Kharven** (*khar-ven*) — Going dormant / dying / descending to Ashra
* **Tulren** (*tul-ren*) — Being banished / forced death / violent severance
* **Narret** (*nar-ret*) — Returning / resurrection / flowing back to life

### The Memory Anchor

Existence in Ashra depends on being **meaningfully remembered** in Selnara:
- Strong anchor (intimate knowledge) = stable Ashra existence
- Losing all anchors = fading, true death
- Ashra death severs anchors, causes forgetting in Selnara

### Key Entities

* **The Parasite** — Feeds on those in Ashra during the death cycle. Has physical presence in Selnara through Pale Medium.
* **The Hollow** — The parasite's immune response. Not agents—antibodies. Drawn to disruptions.
* **The Awakened** — Dead in Ashra who remember they lived. Form underground networks.
* **Faction Agents** — Awakened who work for Selnara powers in Ashra.

### Power System Integration (LOCKED)

The cosmology is **deeply integrated** with the industrial power systems:

* **Grey Current** = boundary energy from death-resurrection cycle
* **Pale Medium** = the parasite's physical substance in Selnara
* **Charged Pale** = activated parasitic connection
* **Signal Pale effects** = direct parasitic influence on consciousness
* **Creatures** = extensions/offspring serving the parasite
* **Necromantic devices** = arcane-punk technology that manipulates the death cycle

The Selnari have built an economy around extracting, refining, and consuming the thing that feeds on them.

# 1) High Concept and Aesthetic Targets

### Core pitch

A **non-Earth** setting with an **1860s–1880s technology baseline** (gaslamp / steam / early electrification as industrial luxury), told in a **neo-noir arcane-punk** mode that can support:

* **frontier extraction violence** (the “western” feel without US/England tropes)
* **gaslit port-city rot and syndicate noir**
* **river-and-desert corridor chokepoint politics**
* an **Alien-style horror vibe** driven by containment failure, industrial labyrinths, and ecology that colonizes infrastructure.

### The “western vibe” without western nouns

The frontier feel comes from  **structure** , not vocabulary:

* distance kills
* scarcity is enforced by geography
* protection is privatized
* law arrives late (or never)
* bargaining happens at gunpoint when arbitration cannot arrive in time
* boom/bust settlements form around extraction and power nodes.

### The “From Hell / Alien vibe”

* soot, fog, cramped corridors, bilges, crawlspaces, vent runs, maintenance hatches
* respectable cruelty: “protocols” used as both safety and social weapon
* bio-industrial horror where **systems behave like predators** and  **habits become rails** .

---
# 1.5) Thematic Spine (LOCKED)

All Selnara stories are built around four interlocking themes:

### Dream (Contamination Residue)

Dreams are **exposure artifacts**, not prophecy. Prolonged Signal exposure causes dream-bleed between workers in shared circuits. You dream what the circuit remembers — other people's memories, protocols you never learned. Signal Mimics nest in shared dream-space.

*Key phrase: "The circuit remembers. You just carry it."*

### Dominion (Cognitive Colonization)

The question is not who rules — it's **who owns your preferences**. Signal Pale doesn't force obedience; it cultivates it. Populations show preference drift — they want what the system needs them to want. The nightmare: discovering you've been governed from inside.

*Key phrase: "The dream of freedom is also installed."*

### Time (Commodity and Weapon)

"Minutes on the manifold" commodifies time economically. Memory shearing weaponizes time perceptually. High-Signal environments cause temporal dysphoria — certainty about sequences that are wrong. Institutions exploit the gap between experience and record.

*Key phrase: "Time is money. Memory is debt."*

### Territory (Fractal Dispossession)

Territory operates at three scales: geographic, somatic (body), cognitive (mind). The same "hold what you can defend" logic applies to claims, tissue, and preferences. You can win a claim war while the pit claims *you*. Dispossession feels the same at every scale.

*Key phrase: "Every claim costs something. The question is what you're paying with."*

### Synthesis

> **The system works exactly as designed. The nightmare is that you've been participating willingly — and you can't prove otherwise.**

---
# 2) World Name and Language

### World name (locked)

**Selnara**

* Fossilized from **sel** (saltwind/coast) + **nar** (river/flowway) + **-a** (old realm ending).
* Common demonym:  **Selnari** .

### Language name (locked)

**Selnara** (the Selnara tongue).
All place names, rivers, countries/polities, major factions, and (when desired) personal names follow Selnara naming rules.

---

# 3) Tech Baseline (1860–1880 hardware layer)

### Power and industry (mundane baseline)

* Steam boilers, coal/char, belt drives, pressure vessels, hydraulic lifts, compressed air
* Foundries, kilns, refineries, chemical works, mining/quarrying, milling
* Glasswork and ceramics are high craft; brass/iron fittings everywhere; riveted plates and tar cloth.

### Light

* Gas lamps and oil lamps everywhere by default
* Electric arc light exists as **rare industrial/lab yard lighting** (not domestic convenience).

### Communications

* Telegraph; repeaters and line stations; signal towers in key corridors
* Print press; posted slips; rumor markets; slow “official” messages.

### Transport

* Rail spurs, wagons, riverboats, cranes/hoists/winches
* Caravans and depots across dead reaches; route windows are life.

### Medicine / forensics

* Antiseptics exist; surgery is brutal; no antibiotics
* Photography exists; lab work is scarce/political; evidence is slow.

### Weapons (explicitly present)

* Revolvers, carbines, shotguns; black powder smoke and glare matter
* Explosives (dynamite equivalents) plausible; melee tools common in tight corridors.

---

# 4) Geographic World Logic (South Africa vibe + Shanghai + Ottoman Egypt sprinkling)

Selnara’s primary play region is a four-part system:

1. **Saltwind Littoral** (coast)
2. **Pale Pits** (interior ringpit country)
3. **Stone River** (civilization spine)
4. **Shear Desert** (edge / dead reaches)

This is the practical geography that supports “port noir + pit frontier + corridor empire.”

### The key physical truth

Settlements form around:

* **charging access**
* **Medium extraction**
* **refining sites**
* **safe corridors**
  more than around food or traditional “gold.”

---

# 5) The Core Power Ecology (locked): Grey Current + Pale Medium

This is the foundation of the setting’s arcane-punk economy and horror.

## 5.1 Grey Current

**What it is:** A persistent atmospheric **electrostatic flow** along ridge-lines and storm shearbelts.
Not lightning. More like a steady “charge wind” that becomes lethal when disturbed.

**Where it lives:**

* Stormspines and ridge chains
* moving shearbelts with spike events
* valleys/hollows where it drains and weakens.

**How it’s harvested (period-appropriate):**

* **Skyframes** : kite-lattices, wire fans, ceramic insulators, glass charge jars.
* Grey Current in jars is unstable and short-lived.

**Key rule:** Grey Current is  **capture power** , not a transport fuel.

## 5.2 Pale Medium

**What it is:** A dense, inert-looking fluid found in subsurface seams/brine pockets.
It is “dead” until **pressure + specific alloys** “wake” it into a stable carrier of energy potential.

**Where it lives:**

* Pale seams in inland basins, old seabeds, salt flats, badlands
* extraction sites are hazardous, labor-heavy, corruptible.

**Key rule:** Pale Medium is the  **platform** : storable, transportable, refinable.

---

# 6) The Standard Industrial Chain (how the world actually runs)

## Step 1 — Capture

Skyframes and jar banks harvest Grey Current at spines/shear edges.

## Step 2 — Hand-off (Grey → Pale)

At Spine facilities, Grey Current is transferred into Pale Medium via **charge manifolds** (glass coils + brass plates + ceramic spacers).

Output commodity: **Charged Pale** (stable enough to transport and trade).

## Step 3 — Cracking (Charged Pale → usable fractions)

At refineries (riverboats or stillworks), Charged Pale is pressure-cycled and catalyst-touched into:

### 1) Motive Pale (work / engines)

* runs compact engines, winches, screw drives, pumps, cranes
* complements steam rather than replacing it.

**Failure mode:** overpressure “kick” — machines jump as if alive.

### 2) Lumen Pale (light / heat)

* powers high-grade lamps, sterilizers, cutting discharges, controlled burns
* premium industrial light/heat; gas lamps remain the everyday norm.

**Failure mode:** “white-out” flare; pigment stripping; afterimage burn.

### 3) Signal Pale (sense / comms / instruments)

* powers telegraph repeaters, detection coils, navigation instruments that work in storms
* most valuable fraction socially because it makes trade safer and control easier.

**Failure mode:** interference + behavioral drift (calm certainty; delayed fear; compliance thresholds shift).

## Step 4 — Waste and byproducts (economy + horror)

Every cracking run leaves residues that create secondary markets and ecosystem pressures:

### A) Spent Varnish

A clingy film that coats pipes, lungs, cloth. Sweet-metal smell.

* used illegally as waterproofing and sealant; spreads contamination.

**Horror:** forms veiny sheets in bilges/crawlspaces; wicks toward warmth; builds conductive pathways.

### B) Grey Ash

Powder precipitate from jars and manifolds.

* poor districts repurpose it in flare sticks and cheap cells
* attracts discharge events; destabilizes nearby metal systems.

**Horror:** sparks chase ash clouds; involuntary muscle mirroring; static storms in rooms.

### C) Pale Dregs

Unstable sludge at vat bottoms.

* used as narcotic, riot agent, “quieting paste” to sleep through storms
* monetization of waste is inevitable.

**Behavioral effect:** widespread dregs use nudges populations toward low-reactivity → social compliance rises, dissent becomes rarer but more explosive.

---

# 7) “Magic” Model (locked): A + B

There is  **no free-standing magic** . Extraordinary effects require either:

### A) Device Path

Jar/manifold/coil/purge/pressure devices using Grey/Pale.

### B) Body Path (Somatic Tuning)

A trained nervous system acts as a **component** in an existing powered circuit.

No third metaphysical layer. No wizardry. No spell ecology separate from Grey/Pale.

---

# 8) Somatic Tuning (Body Path) — “Casters” without wizardry

### Practitioner identity

Trade-coded names (not fantasy-coded). The working label used:

* **Latchhands** (preferred)
  Also acceptable: Grounders, Coilers, Sealborn (optional variants later).

### What Somatic Tuning is

A trained person can deliberately modulate how Signal Pale / Grey leakage entrains the nervous system using:

* breath timing
* muscle bracing
* skin contact points (calluses/scars matter)
* conductive pads / “hand irons” built into devices and rigs.

**They do not generate power.** They shape it locally and briefly.

## 8.1 Latchhand techniques (tight, practical, non-flashy)

1. **Bleed-Read**

* Sense gradients: leaks, hot varnish loops, counterfeit Charged Pale, live walls.
* Room-scale; noisy environments reduce accuracy.

2. **Latch**

* Stabilize a manifold/coil for **5–30 seconds** — enough to reseal/vent/extract.
* Repetition stacks neurological damage.

3. **Quiet**

* Modulate Signal exposure in a space to suppress panic and coordinate action.
* Socially dangerous: used for safety and coercion.

4. **Cut-Loop**

* Ground a varnish conductive loop through the body using pads.
* Highest fatality risk; the “hero move.”

5. **Mark-Safe / Mark-Hot**

* Accurate boundary marking (chalk/paint/metal tabs).
* This replaces paperwork: safety is  **public, visible, physical** .

## 8.2 Costs (real, ugly, story-driving)

* Neurological injury: tremors, seizures, tinnitus, smell/taste loss
* Memory shearing: missing minutes, wrong ordering, false certainty
* Preference drift: repeated Signal work makes them calmer, more compliant, less urgency-capable
* Social distrust: enemies call them softened/looped; allies fear dependence.

## 8.3 Evidence it leaves (no secret powers)

* Galvanic scarring patterns on palms/forearms
* Pulse recovery signature (medics can test)
* metal taste; eye-film; short-term tells
* instrument “flatline shimmer” around latch events
* varnish sheets visibly route away from recent grounding paths.

## 8.4 Hard limits (prevents drift into generic magic)

* No energy creation
* No ranged “spell blasts”
* Requires physical contact + existing powered circuit
* Effects are burst control, not sustained enchantment.

---

# 9) Combat Layer (casters + guns; not “environment control only”)

The setting supports action scenes where rigged “casters” fight like duelists  **inside a gun world** .

## 9.1 The missing ingredient (locked): Personal Circuits

Combatants wear  **Combat Rigs** :

* small Charged Pale vials (limited “ammo”)
* micro-manifold that cracks fractions on demand
* coil bracers / palm plates / throat latches for routing.

Visual caster silhouette:

* **Coilbracer** : brass/ceramic cuff with glass window where charge crawls
* **Jarline belt/harness** : 2–4 slim vials with pinch valves like Victorian cartridges
* **Palm plates / ring contacts** : circuit closes on clench
* **Throat latch** : Signal routing; looks intimate and ominous.

## 9.2 “Spell” families in combat (device+body, cinematic)

### Motive Bursts (kinetic)

* Impulse Palm (concussive shove at close range)
* Tether Yank (charged line jerk/disarm)
* Deadstep (one impossible lunge/shift; limited)

**Costs:** tremor, nausea, numbness.

### Lumen Cuts (light/heat)

* Arc Shear (razor discharge across wire loop; cuts straps/flesh)
* Flashblind (white-out flare for reposition)
* Purge Kiss (contact burn; cauterizes and cooks)

**Costs:** eye-film, bleaching, hot varnish smell.

### Signal Works (mind-fight without telepathy)

* Quiet Drop (3–8 seconds of “why am I doing this?” hesitation)
* Jitter Spoil (fine motor timing failure)
* False Safe (makes one doorway feel safe)

**Costs:** symmetric poison; preference drift.

## 9.3 Bullet counters (limited, angle-dependent, costly)

These are not “bullet immunity.” They steal timing/line/position.

1. **Arc-Shear Curtain**

* microsecond arc sheet across a narrow lane; destabilizes a single shot (turns hit to graze/miss)
* works best close; must be timed; can blind user.

2. **Impulse Jink**

* Motive reposition burst to not be where the shot lands
* once/twice per fight; legs go numb after.

3. **Jitter Spoil**

* ruins trigger timing, aim settling, reload fine motor
* subtle; poisonous to user over time.

4. **Ash-Draw**

* Grey ash scatter makes arcs jump wrong; increases misfires/ricochet behavior near metal
* best indoors/close; wind reduces reliability; attracts later hazards/creatures.

5. **Shotcatch Mesh**

* ceramic-fiber + conductive threads garment that bleeds bullet energy
* heavy/hot; “loads up” into dangerous hotspots.

## 9.4 Duel formats (explicitly not “high noon standoff”)

* Angle Duel (cover geometry; steal a clean line)
* Reload Duel (the fight is between chambers; force fumbles)
* Lantern Duel (afterimages + smoke + glare; one flash decides)
* Corridor Duel (ricochets, arc curtains, ash draw; room becomes combatant)

## 9.5 Combat archetypes (expandable)

* Coil Gunner (shoot-first, uses bursts to win exchange)
* Quiet Knife (Signal hesitation → close decisive cut/shot)
* Breaker (anti-caster: ash, spikes, seal paste; wins with practical cover and carbine)

# 10) Alien-Style Creature Ecology (born from Grey/Pale exposure)

Creatures aren’t “magic beasts.” They are **contamination-adapted life** shaped by selective pressure from Grey Current, Pale Medium, and residues. They colonize  **infrastructure** .

## 10.1 The exposure ecologies

1. Spines (Grey capture zones): discharge, ash, jar failures
2. Seamfields (Pale extraction): seepage into soil/water, pressure “wake” events
3. Crackers/Stills (refineries): varnish, dregs, catalyst dust; the byproduct capital
4. Corridors (routes/boats/depots): mobile contamination; hitchhikers.

## 10.2 Creature families (setting-ready)

### Ashwrights (Grey Ash fauna)

* small communal scavengers that “eat” static and nest near insulators
* chew resin seals; cause slow failures and false readings
* defensive ash spit clouds that make lamps stutter and nerves twitch.

### Varnish Sheets (Spent Varnish colonies)

* translucent veined film that wicks toward warmth and vibration
* lays conductive threads; turns spaces into soft traps
* patient infrastructure predator: facilities become stomachs.

### Pale-Gilled (Medium seep mutants)

* altered animals/humans: glossy eyes, pallid tissue, pressure “breathing” structures
* drawn to pump sounds and pressure changes
* not always aggressive; destructive by persistence and strength.

### Signal Mimics (psychoparasites / environmental nodes)

* vent/lamp-housing organisms that stabilize Signal profiles
* make humans feel calm, safe, compliant; people ignore warnings
* crews become “helpful” while the facility nests.

### Jar-Thieves (infrastructure predators)

* creatures that target jar banks as food sources
* crack collars, lap condensation, cause power loss cascades leading to panic violence.

## 10.3 A locked lifecycle concept (systemic horror)

Grey Ash conditions → micro-colonies → varnish-compatible residues → varnish threads form loops → loops stabilize Signal → humans feel safe → maintenance compliance increases → exposure increases → facility becomes a nest without anyone choosing it.

---

# 11) Institutional/Economic Structures (non-US/England vibe; not clerk-world)

This setting’s politics are driven by  **compatibility regimes** ,  **charging bottlenecks** ,  **corridor chokepoints** , and **waste economies** — not by registries and ledgers.

## 11.1 Core institutional actors (names are functional labels; Selnara versions can be coined consistently later)

* **Standard Enclaves** (port zones defined by hardware standards: jar-mouth sizes, seal resins, catalyst alloys, coil geometries)
* **Beghel Syndics** (counterfeiters and legitimizers of beghels)
* **Khergem Brokers** (sell charging time; "minutes on the manifold")
* **Navsad Piers** (violence tolerated only where it won't wreck shared infrastructure)
* **Claim Rings** (pit territory held by presence and machinery placement)
* **Breaker Crews** (anti-rig squads: ash, grounding spikes, seal paste)
* **Purge Houses** (containment craft-cults; hated until needed)
* **Corridor Keepers** (logistics sovereigns; enforce access by denial, not paperwork)

## 11.2 Deep theory loops built into the economy (explicitly part of the setting)

* Hold-up problems at Spines (charging bottlenecks extort carriers)
* Adverse selection in Charged Pale markets (counterfeits; costly verification arms race)
* Moral hazard in transport (cut purge cycles to save time; externalize leakage risk)
* Standards wars (compatibility becomes power; blocs fight over jar/seal norms)
* Tail-risk insurance failure (Grey events correlate; underwriting becomes predatory protection contracts)
* Signaling games (clean certificates, safe gear marks, purity tests, counterfeit escalation)
* Behavioral economics: hyperbolic discounting under corridor threat, omission bias (“sailing on” vs quarantining), motivated reasoning about symptoms (“coal cough”), preference corrosion from Signal exposure.

---

# 12) Primary Region Build (South Africa vibe + Shanghai + Ottoman Egypt blend)

Selnara’s main play region is designed around three anchor settlement types:

## 12.1 Brasswake Quays analog (locked as Selnara name below)

A treaty-port noir city where borders are  **hardware standards** . Dense canals, warehouses, industrial docks, syndics, smuggling in beghels/fractions, Navsad Piers.

## 12.2 Ringpits of Kharrow analog

A terraced crater extraction metropolis where Grey storms lick the rim. Vertical city violence, claim rings, hoists, purge lamps, varnish nests in deep levels.

## 12.3 Lockward analog

A river chokepoint lock-fort city controlling passage windows. Quarantine as routine; tokens and gear marks as access control; lockworks setpiece battles.

---

# 13) Selnara Conlang (Template v2.0, deep/complex)

## 13.1 Phonology and orthography (locked design intent)

* Vowels: a e i o u (length possible; dialectal)
* Consonants include p b t d k g q; fricatives f v s z sh zh h kh; affricates ts dz ch j; nasals m n ng ny; liquids r l; glides w y

* A mu-/ba- persons
* B ki-/si- tools/rigs
* C na-/ta- substances
* D lo-/ro- places
* E se-/me- states/conditions
* F u-/i- forces/weather

Modifiers show concord in formal register; Quay speech often reduces it.

## 13.3 Three morphological families (prevents sameness)

* **Family I:** class + root + derivation (technical/formal)
* **Family II:** compounds (street/pit)
* **Family III:** fossil stems (ancient cities/world name style)

## 13.4 Toponym system (non-uniform, locked menu)

### Settlement finals (rotate; do not repeat one constantly)

Ports/waterside: -mara, -doka, -selu
Pits/extraction: -khar, -veth, -goro
River/locks: -tul, -warda, -naru
Desert/corridors: -shet, -hassa, -qir
Old settled: -ven, -raza

### Naming strategies (AI must choose one each time)

A) GeoRoot + PlaceFinal
B) HouseMark + SiteType
C) Compound Root–Root
D) Fossil stem
E) Dual-name (Formal + dock-name)

### Pronounceability guardrails

Major names: 2–3 syllables preferred; harsh phonemes used sparingly and purposefully.

## 13.5 Seed roots (locked anchors to prevent drift)

---

# 14) Selnara Naming System v1.0 (for all future proper nouns)

## 14.1 Rivers / waterways rule (locked)

Hydronyms start with **U-** (force/water class marker).
Format:  **U + root(s)** .

## 14.2 Countries / polities rule (locked)

States end with **-se** (“realm/state”).
Common speech may drop -se.

## 14.3 “Any AI” naming prompt block (locked usage)

When generating names:

* Use Georgian-derived root seeds: kalak, zeva, sha, karesh, meta, dinar, kid, safek, sirem, kava, sul, benel, natel
* Apply mutation rules: cluster simplification, ejective softening, final trim
* Keep syllables (C)V(C), penultimate stress
* Output segmentation + Georgian source + literal gloss + intended meaning
