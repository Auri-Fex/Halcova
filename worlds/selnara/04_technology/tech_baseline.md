# Tech Baseline (1860–1880 Hardware Layer)

## Power and Industry (Mundane Baseline)

* Steam boilers, coal/char, belt drives, pressure vessels, hydraulic lifts, compressed air
* Foundries, kilns, refineries, chemical works, mining/quarrying, milling
* Glasswork and ceramics are high craft; brass/iron fittings everywhere; riveted plates and tar cloth

## Light

* Gas lamps and oil lamps everywhere by default
* Electric arc light exists as **rare industrial/lab yard lighting** (not domestic convenience)

## Communications

* Telegraph; repeaters and line stations; signal towers in key corridors
* Print press; posted slips; rumor markets; slow "official" messages

## Transport

* Rail spurs, wagons, riverboats, cranes/hoists/winches
* Caravans and depots across dead reaches; route windows are life

## Medicine / Forensics

* Antiseptics exist; surgery is brutal; no antibiotics
* Photography exists; lab work is scarce/political; evidence is slow

## Weapons (Explicitly Present)

* Revolvers, carbines, shotguns; black powder smoke and glare matter
* Explosives (dynamite equivalents) plausible; melee tools common in tight corridors
