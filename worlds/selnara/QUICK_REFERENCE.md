# Selnara World Bible — Quick Reference

## Cosmological Foundation (LOCKED)

**Selnara** = World of the living
**Ashra** = Underworld / land of the dead (appears as "Earth")

Every Selnari dies daily (**Kharven**) and is resurrected each morning (**Narret**). A parasitic entity feeds on the dead during Ashra-time.

**Memory Anchors**: Ashra existence depends on being remembered in Selnara. Lose all anchors = true death.

**The Hollow**: Parasite's immune response—not agents, antibodies. Drawn to disruptions.

**The Awakened**: Dead in Ashra who remember they lived. Some work as **Faction Agents** for Selnara powers.

### Power System Integration (LOCKED)

The cosmology is deeply integrated with the industrial systems:

* **Grey Current** = boundary energy from death-resurrection cycle
* **Pale Medium** = parasite's physical substance in Selnara
* **Signal Pale** = fraction retaining most parasitic influence
* **Creatures** = parasitic extensions serving the main entity
* **Necromancy** = arcane-punk devices manipulating the death cycle

## High Concept (10-Second Pitch)

**Neo-noir arcane-punk** set in a **non-Earth 1860s–1880s tech world** where industrial infrastructure feeds on contaminated waste and **bio-industrial parasites colonize maintenance corridors**.

## Core Power System

**Grey Current** (atmospheric charge flow / boundary energy) + **Pale Medium** (subsurface fluid / parasitic substance) → **Charged Pale** (energy commodity / activated parasitic connection)

**Charged Pale cracks into three fractions**:
1. **Motive Pale** (engines/work)
2. **Lumen Pale** (light/heat)
3. **Signal Pale** (comms/sense + parasitic influence)

**Waste byproducts** fuel creature ecology and black markets.

**Cosmological integration**: The entire industrial chain is unknowingly a system for harvesting and refining the parasite's presence. Signal Pale's behavioral effects are direct parasitic influence.

## Core "Magic" System

**Latchhands / Somatic Tuning**: Physical skill that shapes Signal Pale behavior through:
* Specific hand/finger postures
* Breath control
* Muscle tension patterns

**Range**: Touch to five paces
**Duration**: Seconds to one minute max
**Cost**: Hunger, shaking, nerve damage risk

**Not spell-casting**—more like "piano technique for combat."

## Combat Logic

**"Personal Circuits"** — duels where practitioners:
* Steal timing via Flinch-Steal (read pre-movement)
* Create false openings via False-Step (induce phantom motion)
* Maintain accuracy via Steady-Hand (suppress tremor)

**NOT bullet-deflection**—just stealing 0.5–2 seconds of advantage.

## Creature Threats

**Parasitic extensions**, not wilderness monsters:

* **Ashwrights**: Ash-silhouettes that mirror killed victims (feed on boundary energy)
* **Varnish Sheets**: Suffocating films in bilges (spread parasitic networks)
* **Pale-Gilled**: Amphibious ambush packs at contamination sites (guard extraction)
* **Signal Mimics**: Voice-imitating entities in telegraph stations (**direct parasitic agents**)

## Necromantic Applications (NEW)

Arcane-punk devices that manipulate the death cycle using Pale:

* **Echo Coils**: Summon fragments of the dead from Ashra
* **Calling Rigs**: Force complete resurrection outside natural cycle
* **Binding Cages**: Prevent Kharven—trap someone in continuous life
* **Tulren Weapons**: Force immediate death/banishment
* **Memory Devices**: Strengthen or weaken memory anchors

## Four Institutional Poles

1. **Standard Enclaves** — Hardware-bordered treaty-ports (safe zones)
2. **Beghel Syndics** — Authentication cartels (reputation as currency)
3. **Khergem Brokers** — Charging monopolists (time on manifold = power)
4. **Navsad Piers** — Arbitrator networks (adjudication when law is absent)

## Geographic System

**Five regions**:
1. **Selina** (Saltwind Littoral) — Port noir cities
2. **Kharveth** (Pale Pit Country) — Vertical extraction terraces
3. **Nartul** (River Locklands) — Corridor chokepoints
4. **Girven** (Stormspine) — Skyframe harvesting sites
5. **Shethassa** (Shear Desert) — Boom/bust depot edges

## Major Locations

* **Zevakalak** — Major port, Standard Enclave hub, Beghel Syndic headquarters
* **Sharem** — Terrace metropolis, Pale extraction hub, Sealed Terrace outbreak zone
* **Kareshkalak** — Lock-fort, river chokepoint, quarantine enforcement
* **Metasafek** — Ridge town, Khergem Broker stronghold, skyframe yards

## Conlang Basics

**Selnara** (world and language name)

**Base Language**: Georgian (mutated) — *kalaki* → kalak, *zghva* → zeva, *ch'a* → sha

**Phonology**: Simple (C)V(C) syllables, penultimate stress

**Core roots** (Georgian-derived):
* **kalak** (city) ← *kalaki*
* **zeva** (sea/coast) ← *zghva*
* **sha** (pit/well) ← *ch'a*
* **karesh** (gate/lock) ← *karibche*
* **meta** (mountain) ← *mta*
* **dinar** (river) ← *mdinare*
* **kid** (edge) ← *kide*
* **safek** (terrace) ← *sapexuri*
* **sirem** (depth) ← *sighrme*

**Formation**: Root + Root (Zeva-kalak, Sha-rem, Karesh-tul)

## Tech Baseline (1860–1880 Hardware)

* Steam, coal, hydraulics, compressed air
* Gas/oil lamps (electric arc rare/industrial only)
* Telegraph, print press, signal towers
* Rail spurs, riverboats, caravans
* Revolvers, carbines, explosives
* Antiseptics exist; no antibiotics

## Story Modes Supported

* **Port noir** (counterfeit Charged Pale, Syndic corruption)
* **Frontier violence** (claim wars, pit territory feuds)
* **Corridor crisis** (quarantine breakdown, blockade math)
* **Mind horror** (cognitive colonization, preference drift, dream contamination)
* **Investigation noir** (the mystery leads inward — what have I become?)

## Thematic Spine (LOCKED)

**Four Pillars**:

1. **Dream** — Exposure artifacts, not prophecy. Circuit memory, dream-bleed, Signal Mimic nesting.
2. **Dominion** — Who owns your preferences? Compliance cultivated, not forced.
3. **Time** — Commodity and weapon. Memory shearing, temporal dysphoria, institutional exploitation.
4. **Territory** — Fractal dispossession. Geographic, somatic, cognitive — all subject to claim logic.

**Synthesis**: The system works as designed. The nightmare is willing participation.

**Key Phrases**:
* *"The circuit remembers. You just carry it."*
* *"The dream of freedom is also installed."*
* *"Time is money. Memory is debt."*
* *"Every claim costs something. The question is what you're paying with."*

## Additional Story Modes

* **Bio-industrial horror** (outbreak containment, creature nests)

## What This Is NOT

❌ Earth setting (no US/England nouns, no "sheriffs")
❌ Free-standing wizardry (no spell schools, no prophecy)
❌ Bureaucracy-as-magic (no ledger metaphysics)
❌ Superhero combat (no bullet immunity)

## Locked Design Elements

✅ **World name**: Selnara
✅ **Tech level**: 1860s–1880s
✅ **Power system**: Grey Current → Pale Medium → Charged Pale
✅ **Magic system**: Somatic Tuning (latchhands)
✅ **Combat range**: Touch to five paces, seconds to one minute
✅ **Creatures**: Bio-industrial parasites, not wilderness monsters
✅ **Institutions**: Four-pole system (no unified empire)
✅ **Conlang**: Selnara phonology and naming rules
✅ **Genre**: Neo-noir arcane-punk, gaslamp horror
