# Creature Ecology — Industrial Parasites

## Core Principle (LOCKED)

Selnara's non-human threats are **not classical monsters**. They are:

* **Bio-industrial**: They colonize infrastructure, not wilderness
* **Behavior-Driven**: They respond to Signal Pale, Charged Pale, and byproduct waste
* **Containment Failures**: They thrive where maintenance lapses

This creates an **Alien-style horror vibe** where the industrial labyrinth itself becomes predatory.

## The Three Base Families

### 1) Ashwrights

**Habitat**: Accumulations of Grey Ash in crawlspaces, vents, sub-floors

**Appearance**: 
* Humanoid silhouette made of compacted ash
* Glowing ember eyes (from trapped charge)
* No solid body structure
* Disperses and reforms

**Behavior**:
* Drawn to electrical activity
* Mirrors human movement patterns
* Crowds toward voices and heartbeats
* Disperses when struck, reforms elsewhere

**Threat**:
* Touch causes static discharge
* Involuntary muscle spasm (mirroring)
* Can overwhelm victims through accumulated charge
* Not intelligent, but persistent

**Horror Element**: They **wear the posture of whoever they killed last**

**Containment**: Ventilation, ash removal, dehumidification, grounding straps

### 2) Varnish Sheets

**Habitat**: Bilges, pipe chases, drains, anywhere Spent Varnish accumulates

**Appearance**:
* Translucent film sheets
* Veiny internal structure
* Absorbs light (looks wet in darkness)
* Can be mistaken for tarp or spill

**Behavior**:
* Wicks toward warmth (body heat)
* Adheres to skin and cloth
* Grows thicker with feeding
* Forms conductive pathways between victims

**Threat**:
* Suffocation (covers mouth/nose)
* Hypothermia (heat drain)
* Conductive bridging (connects victims to machinery)
* Slow death unless removed immediately

**Horror Element**: **Multiple victims become a living circuit**, convulsing in sync

**Containment**: Fire watch, varnish burn-off, sealed drainage, regular pipe scraping

### 3) Pale-Gilled

**Habitat**: Pale seeps, waste vats, contaminated groundwater

**Appearance**:
* Amphibious humanoid shape
* Translucent pale-gray skin
* Feathery gill structures on neck/ribs
* Bloated limbs
* Slow, deliberate movement

**Behavior**:
* Nocturnal, photophobic
* Drawn to Pale Dregs
* Territorial around contamination sites
* Pack hunters in groups of 3–7

**Threat**:
* Surprisingly strong grip
* Drag victims into water/waste
* Pack coordination in ambushes
* Induces behavioral drift (calm compliance) through proximity

**Horror Element**: Victims caught alive are **kept docile while being consumed**

**Containment**: Sealed sumps, waste disposal protocols, armed watch at extraction sites

## Signal Mimics (Fourth Family — Advanced Threat)

**Habitat**: High-concentration Signal Pale environments (telegraph stations, repeater junctions)

**Appearance**:
* No consistent form
* Sometimes visual echo of recent person
* Sometimes just distortion of light/space
* Shimmer effect near discharge coils

**Behavior**:
* Intercepts telegraph signals
* "Speaks" through clicking relays
* Impersonates voices of operators
* Lures victims into maintenance areas

**Threat**:
* Causes behavioral drift (compliance, calm certainty)
* Separates victims from groups
* No physical attack—victims walk into danger voluntarily
* Memory confusion afterward

**Horror Element**: **Victims insist they were following protocol and don't remember danger**

**Containment**: Operator rotation, buddy system, sealed maintenance hatches, regular discharge of static buildup

## Nest Ecology and Outbreak Events

### How Nests Form

1. **Waste Accumulation**: Ash, varnish, or dregs build up unnoticed
2. **Maintenance Lapse**: Containment protocols ignored or cut for profit
3. **Catalyst Event**: Discharge spike, pressure failure, or contamination
4. **First Appearance**: Single creature/incident dismissed as accident
5. **Exponential Spread**: Population doubles every few days
6. **Outbreak**: Multiple types in symbiosis; infrastructure becomes labyrinth

### Symbiotic Threat Combinations

**Ashwrights + Varnish Sheets**:
* Ash disperses, sheets catch fleeing victims
* Conductive bridges amplify discharge events

**Pale-Gilled + Varnish Sheets**:
* Sheets herd victims toward water
* Pale-Gilled wait in sumps

**Signal Mimics + Any**:
* Mimics lure victims into nest zones
* Physical threats finish the work

### Outbreak Cascade

1. **Day 1–3**: Isolated incidents, dismissed as accidents
2. **Day 4–7**: Pattern recognized, containment attempted
3. **Day 8–14**: Multiple sectors compromised, evacuation considered
4. **Day 15+**: Full quarantine or purge; infrastructure loss accepted

## Containment as Social System

### Why Outbreaks Happen

* **Cost-cutting**: Waste disposal is expensive; delayed = profit
* **Corruption**: Inspectors bribed to ignore violations
* **Ignorance**: New workers unaware of protocols
* **Desperation**: Settlements need the work even if unsafe

### The Economic Dilemma

**Clean operations cost more** → **Operators cut corners** → **Creatures appear** → **Cleanup costs more than prevention** → **Cycle repeats**

### Class Dynamics

* **Workers**: Die first, blame management
* **Foremen**: Enforce corners, scapegoat workers
* **Owners**: Profit from lapse, blame "bad luck"
* **Arbitrators**: Arrive late, assess blame after deaths

## Famous Outbreak Events (Story Hooks)

### The Kharras Terrace Seal (15 Years Ago)

* **Cause**: Pale Dregs dumped in old mine shaft
* **Result**: Pale-Gilled population explosion
* **Outcome**: Entire terrace sealed; 200+ deaths
* **Legacy**: "Sealed Terrace" now off-limits; rumors of survivors

### The Selmara Bellworks Incident (8 Years Ago)

* **Cause**: Grey Ash accumulation in foundry sub-floors
* **Result**: Ashwright outbreak during night shift
* **Outcome**: 40 workers dead before dawn; building burned
* **Legacy**: Labor laws changed (briefly); ash protocols "strengthened"

### The Tulwarda Repeater Station Drift (3 Years Ago)

* **Cause**: Signal Mimic in main junction
* **Result**: 12 operators followed "protocol" into flooded maintenance tunnel
* **Outcome**: Station decommissioned; survivors unreliable witnesses
* **Legacy**: Telegraph operators refuse solo shifts; insurance rates up

## Design Use in Stories

### Noir Mystery: "Who Cut Corners?"

Investigation reveals creature outbreak was preventable; someone profited from lapse

### Horror Survival: "Seal or Save?"

Outbreak in progress; evacuate and lose the site, or purge and risk more deaths?

### Frontier Boom-Bust: "The Claim is Compromised"

Pale extraction site has Pale-Gilled nest; keep working or abandon investment?

### Corridor Crisis: "Quarantine Math"

Lock down transport chokepoint to contain outbreak? Upstream settlements starve.
