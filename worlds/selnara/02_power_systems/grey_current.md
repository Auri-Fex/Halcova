# Grey Current

## What It Is

A persistent atmospheric **electrostatic flow** along ridge-lines and storm shearbelts.

Not lightning. More like a steady "charge wind" that becomes lethal when disturbed.

## Cosmological Truth (LOCKED)

**Grey Current is boundary-bleed energy—the discharge released by the death-resurrection cycle.**

Every Kharven (death into Ashra) and every Narret (resurrection to Selnara) releases energy as consciousness crosses between worlds. This energy accumulates in the atmosphere, flowing along paths of least resistance—ridgelines, storm shears, high places.

Grey Current is, in essence, **the breath of the cycle itself**.

This is why:
- It's persistent but unpredictable (tied to the rhythm of billions of deaths/resurrections)
- It must be combined with Pale Medium to be useful (boundary energy + parasitic substance = power)
- Storm spikes correlate with mass events (battles, plagues, disasters that cause many deaths)
- Skyframe workers report strange dreams and déjà vu (exposure to boundary energy)

**The Selnari do not know this.** They treat Grey Current as a natural atmospheric phenomenon.

## Where It Lives

* Stormspines and ridge chains
* Moving shearbelts with spike events
* Valleys/hollows where it drains and weakens

## How It's Harvested (Period-Appropriate)

**Skyframes**: kite-lattices, wire fans, ceramic insulators, glass charge jars

### Key Components

* **Kite-lattices**: Aerial structures that catch charge flow
* **Wire fans**: Conductive arrays that channel current
* **Ceramic insulators**: Prevent discharge and ground leakage
* **Glass charge jars**: Storage vessels for captured current

## Characteristics

* Grey Current in jars is **unstable and short-lived**
* Cannot be transported long distances
* Requires immediate transfer to Pale Medium
* Capture efficiency varies with weather conditions

## Key Rule (LOCKED)

Grey Current is **capture power**, not a transport fuel.

It must be transferred to Pale Medium at Spine facilities for storage and transport.

**Cosmological note**: This is because Grey Current (boundary energy) must be bound to Pale Medium (parasitic substance) to be stabilized. The combination creates Charged Pale—the parasitic connection made manifest and usable.

## Hazards

* Discharge events during harvesting
* Equipment failure in storms
* Worker electrocution
* Jar rupture and cascade failures
* Shear spike unpredictability

## Economic Impact

* Skyframe placement = territorial control
* Charging time = commodity ("minutes on the manifold")
* Khergem Brokers control access
* Hold-up problems at bottleneck sites
* Weather forecasting = strategic intelligence
