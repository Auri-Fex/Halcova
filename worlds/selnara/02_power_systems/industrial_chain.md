# The Standard Industrial Chain

## How the World Actually Runs

### Step 1 — Capture

**Skyframes and jar banks harvest Grey Current at spines/shear edges**

* Kite-lattices deploy during favorable weather
* Wire fans channel flow to jar banks
* Ceramic insulators prevent ground leakage
* Workers monitor discharge risks

### Step 2 — Hand-off (Grey → Pale)

**At Spine facilities, Grey Current is transferred into Pale Medium via charge manifolds**

Components:
* Glass coils
* Brass plates
* Ceramic spacers
* Pressure valves

**Output commodity: Charged Pale** (stable enough to transport and trade)

### Step 3 — Cracking (Charged Pale → Usable Fractions)

**At refineries (riverboats or stillworks), Charged Pale is pressure-cycled and catalyst-touched into three fractions:**

## 1) Motive Pale (Work / Engines)

**Purpose**: Mechanical power

* Runs compact engines, winches, screw drives, pumps, cranes
* Complements steam rather than replacing it
* More energy-dense than coal for portable applications

**Failure Mode**: Overpressure "kick" — machines jump as if alive

**Uses**:
* Factory equipment
* Hoist systems in pits
* Riverboat auxiliary power
* Crane operations in docks

## 2) Lumen Pale (Light / Heat)

**Purpose**: Illumination and thermal applications

* Powers high-grade lamps, sterilizers, cutting discharges, controlled burns
* Premium industrial light/heat; gas lamps remain the everyday norm
* Brighter and more stable than gas

**Failure Mode**: "White-out" flare; pigment stripping; afterimage burn

**Uses**:
* Industrial yard lighting
* Surgical illumination
* Cutting torches
* Emergency signaling

## 3) Signal Pale (Sense / Comms / Instruments)

**Purpose**: Enhanced perception and communication

* Powers telegraph repeaters, detection coils, navigation instruments that work in storms
* Most valuable fraction socially because it makes trade safer and control easier
* Enables infrastructure coordination

**Failure Mode**: Interference + behavioral drift (calm certainty; delayed fear; compliance thresholds shift)

**Uses**:
* Telegraph relay stations
* Navigation equipment
* Storm-sensing instruments
* Leak detection coils

## Step 4 — Waste and Byproducts (Economy + Horror)

Every cracking run leaves residues that create secondary markets and ecosystem pressures:

### A) Spent Varnish

**A clingy film that coats pipes, lungs, cloth. Sweet-metal smell.**

* Used illegally as waterproofing and sealant
* Spreads contamination
* Cheap alternative for poor districts

**Horror**: Forms veiny sheets in bilges/crawlspaces; wicks toward warmth; builds conductive pathways

### B) Grey Ash

**Powder precipitate from jars and manifolds**

* Poor districts repurpose it in flare sticks and cheap cells
* Attracts discharge events
* Destabilizes nearby metal systems

**Horror**: Sparks chase ash clouds; involuntary muscle mirroring; static storms in rooms

### C) Pale Dregs

**Unstable sludge at vat bottoms**

* Used as narcotic, riot agent, "quieting paste" to sleep through storms
* Monetization of waste is inevitable
* Black market commodity

**Behavioral Effect**: Widespread dregs use nudges populations toward low-reactivity → social compliance rises, dissent becomes rarer but more explosive

## Economic Dynamics

**Extraction bottlenecks** at Spine facilities create:
* Hold-up problems (charging time extortion)
* Territorial conflicts
* Price volatility

**Cracking quality** determines:
* Fraction ratios (can be manipulated)
* Purity (affects price and safety)
* Waste volume (disposal costs vs. black market profit)

**Byproduct markets** create:
* Underground waste economies
* Public health crises
* Contamination spread
* Creature ecology fuel
