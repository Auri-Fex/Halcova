# Necromantic Applications — Pale-Based Death Magic

## Status: LOCKED

This document describes how the Selnari power system enables manipulation of the death-resurrection cycle. All necromancy is **arcane-punk technology**, not free-standing wizardry.

---

## Core Principle

**Necromancy is applied parasitology.**

Because Pale Medium is the physical substance of the parasite, and Grey Current is boundary energy from the death cycle, devices that concentrate and direct these forces can manipulate the Ashra-Selnara connection.

This is not separate magic—it's **advanced industrial application** of the same power systems that run telegraphs and engines.

## The Necromantic Spectrum

All death-magic exists on a spectrum based on how much parasitic substance and boundary energy is concentrated:

| Application | Pale Concentration | Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Standard Signal devices | Low | Communication, sensing, mild behavioral drift |
| Dream-tapping | Medium | Reading/recording circuit memory, dream-bleed induction |
| Echo summoning | High | Pulling fragments of consciousness from Ashra |
| Full calling | Very High | Forcing complete resurrection outside natural cycle |
| Binding | Extreme | Preventing Kharven entirely, trapping in life |
| Tulren (banishment) | Weaponized | Forcing immediate death, severing connection |

## Necromantic Devices (Arcane-Punk Technology)

### Echo Coils

**Purpose**: Summon fragments/echoes of the dead from Ashra

**Components**:
- Concentrated Signal Pale reservoir
- Spiral brass coil with ceramic core
- Glass focusing chamber
- Copper grounding plates

**How it works**:
1. Target is identified (name, image, personal effect)
2. Signal Pale is cycled through the coil, creating localized boundary thinning
3. The fragment is pulled through—appearing as ghostly, partial, translucent
4. Echo persists for minutes to hours depending on Pale supply

**Limitations**:
- Echoes are incomplete—memories fragmented, personality partial
- Cannot fully interact with physical world
- Drains quickly without continuous Pale feed
- Repeated summoning of same target degrades them in Ashra

**Appearance**: Brass cylinder with glass windows showing swirling pale fluid, wire leads, ceramic handles. Desktop to suitcase sized. Hums and crackles during operation.

### Calling Rigs

**Purpose**: Force complete resurrection (full Narret) outside natural cycle

**Components**:
- Large Charged Pale reservoir (barrel-sized minimum)
- Manifold array with multiple coils
- Catalyst chamber for fraction separation
- Brass-and-ceramic focusing apparatus
- Grounding array (copper stakes, wire mesh)

**How it works**:
1. Target must be currently in Ashra (their Selnara body exists but is "asleep")
2. Massive Pale discharge creates forced boundary breach
3. Target's consciousness is ripped from Ashra to Selnara
4. They "wake" suddenly, violently, often traumatized

**Limitations**:
- Requires knowing target's Selnara body location (or being near it)
- Enormous Pale consumption (expensive, detectable)
- Target's Ashra body collapses (coma)
- Can cause psychological damage—being called feels like being ripped apart
- Doesn't work if target has no Selnara body (the Severed, true dead)

**Appearance**: Room-sized installation or large wagon-mounted apparatus. Multiple brass cylinders, coiled tubing, glass reservoirs glowing with Pale. Steam vents, pressure gauges, ceramic insulators. Industrial-medical hybrid aesthetic.

### Binding Cages

**Purpose**: Prevent Kharven—trap someone in continuous life

**Components**:
- Continuous Pale circulation system
- Cage/chamber structure with Pale-saturated lining
- Redundant power supply
- Monitoring apparatus

**How it works**:
1. Subject is placed in Pale-saturated environment
2. The parasitic presence prevents the natural death-pull
3. Subject cannot Kharven—they remain in Selnara indefinitely
4. Their Ashra self never "wakes up"

**Limitations**:
- Requires continuous Pale supply (expensive, vulnerable)
- Subject eventually suffers insomnia-equivalent symptoms (exhaustion without rest)
- Prolonged binding causes psychological breakdown
- If power fails, subject immediately Kharvens (often violently)

**Uses**:
- Interrogation (subject can't escape to Ashra)
- Protection (VIPs kept in life during danger periods)
- Punishment (forced consciousness without rest)
- Medical (keeping critical patients "alive" until treatment possible)

**Appearance**: Room or chamber with pale-glowing walls, circulation pipes, humming machinery. Subject may be restrained or free within. Clinical-prison aesthetic.

### Tulren Weapons (Banishment Devices)

**Purpose**: Force immediate death/banishment to Ashra

**Components**:
- Concentrated, weaponized Pale charge
- Delivery mechanism (projectile, contact, area effect)
- Disruption catalyst (breaks the life-connection)

**Types**:

**Tulren Rounds**: Ammunition containing Pale-catalyst compound. On impact, forces immediate Kharven. Victim collapses as consciousness is ripped to Ashra. Non-lethal to body, but effectively a "kill shot" for removing someone from a situation.

**Severance Needles**: Close-range injection device. More precise than rounds. Used for assassination—target appears to fall asleep, actually forcibly banished.

**Banishment Grenades**: Area effect. Everyone in blast radius experiences forced Kharven. Used for crowd control, military operations, emergency containment.

**How it works**:
1. Weaponized Pale disrupts the subject's parasitic connection
2. The normal resistance to Kharven collapses
3. Subject's consciousness is immediately pulled to Ashra
4. Body remains but is "asleep"—subject is now in the underworld

**Limitations**:
- Only works on those with Selnara-Ashra connection (not the Severed, not the Hollow)
- Targets can be resurrected later (not permanent death)
- For permanent death, must also kill them in Ashra
- Highly regulated/illegal in most jurisdictions

**Appearance**: Modified ammunition with pale-glowing tips. Syringes with ceramic reservoirs. Grenades with glass cores showing swirling fluid.

### Memory Anchor Devices

**Purpose**: Strengthen or weaken memory anchors

**Strengthen (Memorial Devices)**:
- Crystallize significant memories into Pale-infused objects
- Anyone possessing the object gains/strengthens the memory
- Used to ensure important figures aren't forgotten (insurance policy for Ashra survival)

**Weaken (Erasure Devices)**:
- Signal Pale tuned to disrupt specific memory patterns
- Targeted at those who remember someone
- Gradually (or suddenly) erases the target from living memory
- Combined with Ashra assassination = complete pruning

**Appearance**: Memorial devices look like portrait frames, jewelry, or keepsakes with faint Pale glow. Erasure devices look like modified Signal equipment—directional, technical, ominous.

## Latchhand Necromancy

Somatic Tuning practitioners (Latchhands) can perform **limited necromantic effects** without devices by using their bodies as conduits:

| Technique | Effect | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Death-Read** | Sense how close someone is to Kharven | Minor fatigue |
| **Dream-Touch** | Access circuit memory of the recently dead | Memory contamination |
| **Anchor-Sense** | Feel the strength of someone's memory anchors | Headache, disorientation |
| **Hold-Life** | Delay Kharven briefly (emergency stabilization) | Severe exhaustion, tremors |
| **Push-Death** | Accelerate Kharven (assist or attack) | Ethical horror, preference drift |

These techniques require touch or near-touch range and leave the Latchhand more exposed to parasitic influence.

## Institutional Control

### Who Controls Necromantic Technology?

| Institution | Access Level | Uses |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| Khergem Brokers | Full | R&D, production, sales to approved parties |
| Beghel Syndics | Moderate | Authentication of devices, licensing |
| Navsad Piers | Limited | Dispute resolution involving resurrection claims |
| Standard Enclaves | Regulated | Import/export control, legal use within borders |
| Black Market | Variable | Unlicensed devices, Tulren weapons, erasure services |

### Legal Status

- **Echo Coils**: Legal with license (used for inheritance disputes, historical research)
- **Calling Rigs**: Restricted (medical/emergency use, special permits)
- **Binding Cages**: Heavily regulated (prison system, medical, abuse potential)
- **Tulren Weapons**: Illegal for civilians, military/security only
- **Memory Devices**: Varies (memorial = legal, erasure = prohibited)

---

## Narrative Applications

### Story Hooks

- Someone is being held in a Binding Cage against their will
- A Tulren weapon falls into criminal hands
- An Echo Coil reveals secrets the dead were supposed to keep
- A Calling Rig is used to resurrect a dangerous figure
- Memory erasure campaign is eliminating witnesses
- A Latchhand discovers they can Push-Death—and someone wants them to use it

### Moral Complexity

Necromantic technology creates ethical dilemmas:
- Is forced resurrection ethical? (The called often suffer)
- Is binding imprisonment or torture? (Life without rest)
- Is Tulren assassination or non-lethal takedown? (Depends on Ashra follow-up)
- Who deserves to be remembered? (Memory anchors as resource)

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

All necromantic devices use the **same industrial chain**:
- Grey Current → Pale Medium → Charged Pale → Signal Pale → Necromantic application
- Same refineries, same Khergem Brokers, same supply chains
- Necromancy isn't separate magic—it's the extreme end of the same spectrum
- Every telegraph station uses dilute versions of the same forces that power Calling Rigs

**The arcane-punk aesthetic is preserved**: brass, glass, ceramic, coils, valves, gauges, pressure systems, industrial-medical hybrid. Necromantic devices look like advanced versions of normal Selnara technology because that's exactly what they are.
