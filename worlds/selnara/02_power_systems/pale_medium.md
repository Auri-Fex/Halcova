# Pale Medium

## What It Is

A dense, inert-looking fluid found in subsurface seams/brine pockets.

It is "dead" until **pressure + specific alloys** "wake" it into a stable carrier of energy potential.

## Cosmological Truth (LOCKED)

**Pale Medium is the physical presence of the parasite bleeding into Selnara.**

The entity that feeds on the dead in Ashra has a physical manifestation in the world of the living. Pale Medium is its substance—its blood, its tissue, its extension into material reality. This is why:

- Signal Pale causes behavioral drift → direct parasitic influence on consciousness
- Dream-bleed occurs in high-Signal environments → the parasite connects Selnara and Ashra
- Charging "wakes" the Medium → activating the parasitic connection
- Creatures colonize Pale-contaminated sites → they're parasitic organisms serving the main entity

**The Selnari do not know this.** They treat Pale Medium as a natural resource. They extract, refine, trade, and consume the substance of the thing that feeds on their deaths.

## Where It Lives

* Pale seams in inland basins
* Old seabeds
* Salt flats
* Badlands subsurface pockets

**Cosmological note**: These sites may be places where the boundary between Selnara and Ashra is naturally thin—where the parasite's presence seeps through most easily.

## Extraction

Extraction sites are:
* Hazardous (pressure events, seepage)
* Labor-heavy (requires continuous pumping)
* Corruptible (claim jumping, sabotage)

### Extraction Process

1. Drill/dig to seam depth
2. Install pressure apparatus
3. Pump to surface storage
4. Stabilize with specific alloys
5. Transport to charging facilities

## Key Rule (LOCKED)

Pale Medium is the **platform**: storable, transportable, refinable.

Unlike Grey Current, Pale can be:
* Stored long-term
* Transported in barrels/tanks
* Traded as commodity
* Refined into fractions

## Characteristics

### Uncharged State

* Inert gray-white fluid
* Viscous, heavy
* Stable indefinitely
* No special storage requirements

### Charged State

* "Wakes" when exposed to Grey Current
* Becomes energy carrier
* Requires sealed containers
* Time-limited stability (days to weeks)

## Economic Impact

* Extraction territories = political power
* Claim Rings defend pit territories
* Counterfeit markets thrive (dilution, substitution)
* Quality verification = costly, specialized
* Transport security = major concern

## Hazards

* Pressure "wake" events during extraction
* Seepage into groundwater
* Catalyst contamination
* Storage vessel failure
* Worker exposure (chronic poisoning)

## Connection to Necromancy (LOCKED)

Because Pale Medium is the parasite's substance, it is the **key component in all death-magic**:

- **Echo summoning** uses Signal Pale to thin the boundary and pull fragments from Ashra
- **Full calling** uses Charged Pale to force resurrection outside the natural cycle
- **Binding** uses concentrated Pale to prevent Kharven (keeping someone alive)
- **Tulren (banishment)** weaponizes Pale to sever someone's connection and force death

Necromantic devices are arcane-punk technology built around Pale manipulation. The refinement process that creates Signal Pale also creates the tools for manipulating the death cycle.
