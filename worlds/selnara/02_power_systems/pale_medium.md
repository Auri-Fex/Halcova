# Pale Medium

## What It Is

A dense, inert-looking fluid found in subsurface seams/brine pockets.

It is "dead" until **pressure + specific alloys** "wake" it into a stable carrier of energy potential.

## Where It Lives

* Pale seams in inland basins
* Old seabeds
* Salt flats
* Badlands subsurface pockets

## Extraction

Extraction sites are:
* Hazardous (pressure events, seepage)
* Labor-heavy (requires continuous pumping)
* Corruptible (claim jumping, sabotage)

### Extraction Process

1. Drill/dig to seam depth
2. Install pressure apparatus
3. Pump to surface storage
4. Stabilize with specific alloys
5. Transport to charging facilities

## Key Rule (LOCKED)

Pale Medium is the **platform**: storable, transportable, refinable.

Unlike Grey Current, Pale can be:
* Stored long-term
* Transported in barrels/tanks
* Traded as commodity
* Refined into fractions

## Characteristics

### Uncharged State

* Inert gray-white fluid
* Viscous, heavy
* Stable indefinitely
* No special storage requirements

### Charged State

* "Wakes" when exposed to Grey Current
* Becomes energy carrier
* Requires sealed containers
* Time-limited stability (days to weeks)

## Economic Impact

* Extraction territories = political power
* Claim Rings defend pit territories
* Counterfeit markets thrive (dilution, substitution)
* Quality verification = costly, specialized
* Transport security = major concern

## Hazards

* Pressure "wake" events during extraction
* Seepage into groundwater
* Catalyst contamination
* Storage vessel failure
* Worker exposure (chronic poisoning)
