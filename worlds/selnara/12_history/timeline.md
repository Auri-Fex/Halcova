## ERA OVERVIEW

| Era | Years | Character |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Discovery Age** | Pre-PE | Pale Medium known but unusable |
| **Emergence** | 0 PE | First Charged Pale capture |
| **Wild Years** | 1–80 PE | Unregulated extraction, boom/bust |
| **Standardization Wars** | 81–127 PE | Four Poles emerge through conflict |
| **Compact Era** | 128–280 PE | Institutional stability, territorial freeze |
| **Present Crisis** | 281–327 PE | Old compacts fraying, new pressures |

---

## DISCOVERY AGE (Pre-PE)

### ~500 Years Before Emergence

**Pale Medium discovered** in deep pit excavations.

- Miners encounter subsurface fluid that causes strange effects
- Early deaths from uncontrolled exposure
- Superstition: "pit blood," "deep tears," cursed ground
- No industrial application—just hazard

### ~200 Years Before Emergence

**First systematic study** of Pale Medium.

- Natural philosophers document properties
- Connection to atmospheric phenomena noted
- Failed attempts to harness—no charging method exists
- Pale treated as curiosity, not resource

### ~50 Years Before Emergence

**Grey Current identified** as distinct phenomenon.

- Storm-chasers document electrical discharge patterns
- Link between atmospheric charge and Pale reactivity theorized
- Early skyframe prototypes fail catastrophically
- "The Burned Generation" — dozens die in capture attempts

---

## YEAR ZERO: THE EMERGENCE (0 PE)

### The Metaven Capture

**Location**: Ridge settlement later named Metasafek

**Event**: First successful transfer of Grey Current to Pale Medium, creating stable Charged Pale.

**Key figures**:
- **Torvani Khergem** — Engineer who designed the first working manifold
- **Salin Metarel** — Natural philosopher who theorized the transfer mechanism
- **The Twelve** — Investors who funded the attempt (names lost to deliberate obscuring)

**Immediate consequences**:
- Word spreads within months
- Rush to ridge sites begins
- Torvani Khergem murdered within the year (by whom: disputed)
- Metasafek becomes first Khergem Broker stronghold

---

## WILD YEARS (1–80 PE)

### The First Rush (1–20 PE)

**Character**: Unregulated chaos, claim violence, fortunes made and lost

**Key developments**:
- Multiple ridge sites establish competing capture operations
- Pit extraction expands to meet demand for raw Pale
- Coastal ports become trade hubs
- No standards, no authentication, no arbitration
- Violence is default conflict resolution

### The Counterfeit Crisis (21–35 PE)

**Character**: Economic collapse from worthless "Charged Pale"

**Problem**: No way to verify Pale quality leads to:
- Massive fraud (diluted, unstable, or fake Charged Pale)
- Buyers cannot trust sellers
- Trade collapses in multiple regions
- Famine and riots in dependent settlements

**Response**: 
- First **beghel marks** emerge (private authentication)
- Competing beghel systems create confusion
- Violence between authenticators

### The Corridor Wars (36–60 PE)

**Character**: Control of transport routes becomes primary conflict

**Key events**:
- River lock-forts built to control Pale movement
- "Toll lords" emerge — proto-Khergem Brokers
- Siege of Kareshtul (then unnamed) — 3-year blockade
- Starvation used as weapon
- First formal arbitration attempts fail

### The Great Seep (61–72 PE)

**Character**: Ecological catastrophe reshapes extraction

**Event**: Massive Pale Medium release in Sharekeoba region

- Uncontrolled extraction punctures deep reservoir
- Contamination spreads across multiple terraces
- Thousands die from exposure
- First documented Pale-Gilled emergence
- Entire settlements abandoned

**Consequence**: Extraction protocols become necessary for survival, not just profit

### The Metaven Compact (73–80 PE)

**Character**: First successful multi-party agreement

**Parties**: Ridge settlements agree to:
- Shared weather intelligence
- Rotating manifold access
- Mutual defense against claim jumpers

**Significance**: Template for later institutional development

---

## STANDARDIZATION WARS (81–127 PE)

### The Beghel Unification (81–95 PE)

**Character**: Violent consolidation of authentication systems

**Problem**: Dozens of competing beghel systems, none trusted universally

**Solution**: 
- **The Zevakalak Accord** (89 PE) — Coastal syndicates agree to mutual recognition
- Non-signatories attacked, absorbed, or eliminated
- "Beghel Wars" kill thousands
- By 95 PE: Three major beghel systems remain

**Key figure**: **Kavaren Beghelis** — "The Unifier" — ruthless syndicate head who forced consolidation (later assassinated)

### The Lock-Fort Standardization (96–110 PE)

**Character**: River corridor brought under unified control

**Problem**: Competing lock-forts charging arbitrary tolls, blocking rivals

**Solution**:
- **The Corridor Compact** (103 PE) — Lock-forts agree to standard tolls, quarantine protocols
- Kareshtul emerges as dominant chokepoint
- Breakaway forts besieged and starved
- "Gate families" established — hereditary lock-masters

**Consequence**: River trade becomes reliable; interior extraction viable

### The Pier Emergence (111–127 PE)

**Character**: Arbitration networks formalize

**Problem**: Disputes between Syndics, Brokers, and Enclaves have no neutral resolution

**Solution**:
- Dock-based arbitrators ("pier-sitters") gain reputation for neutrality
- **Navsad Charter** (119 PE) — First formal arbitrator network
- Reputation system codified
- "Pier rulings" become enforceable through trade exclusion

**End of era**: By 127 PE, the Four Poles exist in recognizable form

---

## COMPACT ERA (128–280 PE)

### The Frozen Map (128–180 PE)

**Character**: Territorial boundaries stabilize; violence decreases

**Key features**:
- Major claim boundaries fixed by treaty
- Standard Enclaves established in all major cities
- Beghel Syndic houses consolidate into ~12 major families
- Khergem Broker compacts control all viable ridge sites
- "The Peace of Exhaustion" — no one can afford more war

### The Refining Revolution (181–220 PE)

**Character**: Technological advancement in Pale processing

**Key developments**:
- **Cracking stillworks** perfected — Charged Pale separated into fractions (Signal, Motive, Lumen)
- Fraction-specific applications explode
- Telegraph networks expand massively
- New wealth from specialized products
- "The Fraction Families" rise — new industrial elite

**Key figure**: **Natelis Sekaren** — Chemist who developed reliable cracking process (221 PE)

### The Signal Spread (221–260 PE)

**Character**: Telegraph and Signal Pale transform society

**Key developments**:
- Telegraph lines connect all major settlements
- Repeater stations create Signal-rich environments
- Latchhand techniques formalize into teachable systems
- First documented Signal Mimic infestations
- "Dream-bleed" recognized as occupational hazard

**Consequence**: Information becomes power; Beghel Syndics gain new leverage through telegraph control

### The Quiet Decay (261–280 PE)

**Character**: Surface stability masks institutional rot

**Signs**:
- Compact agreements increasingly violated
- Beghel counterfeiting resurges
- Khergem families feud internally
- Navsad Pier neutrality questioned
- "Everyone cheats; everyone knows; no one acts"

---

## PRESENT CRISIS (281–327 PE)

### The Sharem Terrace Seal (312 PE — 15 Years Ago)

**Location**: Sharem, deep terrace district

**Event**: Catastrophic contamination outbreak, entire terrace sealed

**Official story**:
- Extraction accident released concentrated Pale
- 200+ deaths from exposure and creature emergence
- Terrace permanently sealed "for safety"
- Survivors (if any) presumed dead

**Rumors**:
- Something was found in the deep seams
- The seal wasn't to keep creatures in — it was to keep something else contained
- Survivors exist, changed
- Khergem Brokers know more than they say

### The Zevakalak Bellworks Incident (319 PE — 8 Years Ago)

**Location**: Zevakalak, industrial bellworks district

**Event**: Mass Signal Mimic infestation, 50+ deaths

**What happened**:
- Telegraph repeater station contaminated
- Workers began following "protocols" no one issued
- Mass walkout into contaminated zone
- Bodies found in ritual arrangement
- Station burned, rebuilt, incident suppressed

**Consequence**: Operator rotation protocols established; "buddy system" mandated

### The Kareshtul Repeater Station Drift (324 PE — 3 Years Ago)

**Location**: Kareshtul, main repeater station

**Event**: Time-perception anomaly affecting all station staff

**What happened**:
- Operators reported "lost hours" and false memories
- Upstream and downstream witnesses disagreed on ship transit times
- Records didn't match any testimony
- Investigation inconclusive
- Three operators never recovered (institutionalized)

**Consequence**: "Signal drift" enters legal vocabulary; used as defense and accusation

### The Present Day (327 PE)

**Current tensions**:
- Old compact agreements expire without renewal
- New Khergem families challenge established houses
- Beghel counterfeiting at highest levels since Wild Years
- Navsad Pier rulings increasingly ignored
- "Something is wrong with the deep seams" — extraction workers report anomalies
- Creature sightings increase across all regions
