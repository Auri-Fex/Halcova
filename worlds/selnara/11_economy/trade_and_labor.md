## ECONOMIC TENSIONS

### The Extraction Squeeze

**Problem**: Pit workers face increasing pressure
- Deeper extraction required as upper seams deplete
- Contamination exposure rising
- Wages not keeping pace with risk
- Crew solidarity building toward action

**Stakeholders**:
- Workers: Want better conditions, hazard pay
- Brokers: Want output maintained, costs controlled
- Syndics: Want documentation fees regardless

**Flashpoint**: Sharem Terrace operations, contamination rates up 40% over five years

### The Charging Bottleneck

**Problem**: Storm season variability affecting supply
- Bad storm seasons reduce charging capacity
- Good seasons strain worker safety
- No buffer stock (Charged Pale degrades)
- Price volatility creates economic instability

**Stakeholders**:
- Brokers: Want consistent output
- Users: Want stable prices
- Workers: Want safety regardless of weather

**Flashpoint**: Last three storm seasons below average; prices rising

### The Transit Toll

**Problem**: Lock-fort fees increasing
- Beghelis-Karesh raising transit costs
- Other Syndics pushing back
- Smuggling operations growing
- Lock workers considering strike action

**Stakeholders**:
- Beghelis-Karesh: Maximum revenue extraction
- Other Syndics: Want lower costs
- Merchants: Squeezed on margins
- Workers: Leverage opportunity

**Flashpoint**: Proposed 15% toll increase next season

### The Frontier Question

**Problem**: Uncontrolled economic activity
- Kidshet region operates outside normal systems
- Expansion efforts create conflict
- Resources flowing without documentation
- Established interests losing control

**Stakeholders**:
- Frontier traders: Want independence
- Syndics: Want authentication monopoly
- Brokers: Want extraction rights
- Enclaves: Want jurisdiction

**Flashpoint**: Broker compound expansion, local resistance
