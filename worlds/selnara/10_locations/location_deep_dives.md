## THE SHAREM SEAL (Quarantine Zone)

### The Official Story

**312 PE** — Fifteen years ago:
- "Industrial accident" at deep extraction site
- Contamination event requiring quarantine
- Zone sealed, population relocated
- Research ongoing, situation "stable"

### What Actually Happened

**The Seep Event**:
- Deep extraction breached something
- Not just Pale Medium — something responsive
- Workers reported shared experiences
- Massive contamination spike
- Quarantine established within hours

**The Sealed Population**:
- 200+ workers couldn't be evacuated in time
- Officially: presumed dead
- Actually: unknown
- Occasional signals from inside
- Research teams won't discuss findings

### The Zone Today

**Physical description**:
- Three terrace levels sealed
- Walls: reinforced concrete, 20 feet thick
- Access: single checkpoint, heavily guarded
- Atmosphere: vents filtered, monitored

**What researchers observe**:
- Pale Medium levels fluctuate unnaturally
- Equipment malfunctions near walls
- Personnel report dreams after visits
- Something responds to observation

**What workers believe**:
- "They woke something up"
- The sealed workers are still alive (somehow)
- Dreams near the zone are messages
- Another breach is inevitable

### Story Potential

- Investigation into the truth
- Contact with something inside
- Quarantine breach scenario
- Discovery of survivors (changed)
- Research team going too far

## LADO'S PLACE (Information Hub)

### Location

**The Tangle**, Zevakalak — Between Navsad Pier and the Wharves

### Physical Description

**Exterior**:
- Unremarkable two-story building
- Faded sign: "The Salt & Signal"
- Side entrance through alley
- Looks like any dockside tavern

**Interior**:
- Ground floor: Functional tavern, average drinks
- Back rooms: Private meeting spaces
- Upper floor: Lado's residence and office
- Basement: Nobody asks

### The Proprietor

**Lado Sharemi**:
- Fifty-three years old
- Former pit region, came to coast thirty years ago
- Built information network from nothing
- Knows everyone; trusts almost no one
- Policy: Sells to all sides equally

**Reputation**:
- Information is accurate (premium priced)
- Neutral ground respected
- Violence on premises = lifetime ban
- Even Syndic enforcers behave here

### How It Works

**Buying information**:
1. Enter tavern, order drink
2. Ask bartender "if Lado's receiving"
3. Wait to be called upstairs
4. State what you need
5. Lado names price
6. Pay (upfront, usually)
7. Information delivered (method varies)

**Selling information**:
1. Same process to access Lado
2. Describe what you have
3. Lado assesses value
4. Negotiation
5. Payment on verification

**Prices** (approximate):
- Simple inquiry: 10–50 puli
- Person location: 50–200 puli
- Background investigation: 200–500 puli
- Sensitive information: 500–2000+ puli
- Ongoing surveillance: Contract negotiated

### The Rules

1. **No violence** — Ever, for any reason
2. **No lies** — Lado cuts off liars permanently
3. **No authority** — Enforcers can drink; they can't investigate
4. **Payment expected** — Credit extended rarely
5. **Discretion assumed** — What you hear doesn't leave

### Story Potential

- Information gathering for any plot
- Meeting point for disparate characters
- Lado as quest-giver or obstacle
- Threats to neutral ground status
- Lado knows something critical

## THE GREAT LOCK (Kareshtul)

### Technical Description

**Dimensions**:
- Chamber: 400 feet long, 80 feet wide
- Lift capacity: 40 feet vertical
- Water volume: 1.2 million cubic feet
- Cycle time: 3 hours full operation

**Operation**:
1. Vessel enters chamber
2. Gates closed, sealed
3. Water pumped in/out (steam-powered)
4. Level matches destination
5. Gates open, vessel proceeds

**Capacity**:
- Large river vessels only
- Smaller boats use side locks
- Cargo priority over passenger
- Schedule strictly maintained

### Political Significance

**Control point**:
- All river trade passes through
- Beghelis-Karesh controls documentation
- Toll revenue funds house operations
- Chokepoint for economic pressure

**Strategic value**:
- Could close river trade entirely
- Threat used in negotiations
- Never actually closed (economic suicide)
- But the possibility grants leverage

### Key Personnel

**Lock-Master Tornike Kareshis**:
- Hereditary position (fourth generation)
- Technical authority absolute
- Political leanings: independent
- Relationship with Syndics: complicated

**The Lock Crews**:
- Three shifts, continuous operation
- Hereditary tendency in families
- Strong solidarity
- Consider themselves elite workers

### Daily Reality

**Traffic**:
- 15–20 vessels per day average
- Peak season: 30+
- Each passage: 3 hours
- Scheduling conflicts constant

**Problems**:
- Bribery for priority
- Documentation disputes
- Equipment maintenance (constant)
- Weather complications
- Smuggling attempts

### The Spillway (Worker Tavern)

**Location**: Adjacent to Great Lock, in The Narrows

**Significance**:
- Lock workers gather here
- Union organizing (informal)
- Owners: Maia and Davit Kareshis (no relation to Lock-Master)
- Syndics watch but can't shut down

**Atmosphere**:
- Workers only (outsiders noticed)
- Political discussion common
- Grievances aired
- Solidarity built

### Story Potential

- Transit bottleneck scenarios
- Labor action plotting
- Lock-Master as ally or obstacle
- Smuggling through the locks
- Lock sabotage threat
