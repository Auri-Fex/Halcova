# Major Locations Gazetteer

## 1) ZEVAKALAK

**zeva-kalak** — "Sea City" *(Georgian: zghva → zeva, kalaki → kalak)*

### Classification

Major coastal port; Standard Enclave hub; treaty-port noir city

### Geography

* Coastal location in Zevareg (Sea Littoral)
* Deep harbor with industrial docks
* Terraced hillside districts
* Warehouse labyrinth near waterfront

### Economy

* Major trade hub for Charged Pale imports
* Refinery district (cracking stillworks on riverboats)
* Telegraph nexus with multiple repeater stations
* Beghel Syndic headquarters district

### Key Districts

**The Standard Enclave** (Central Treaty Zone):
* Hardware-enforced boundaries
* Weapons checked at gates
* Insurance-backed security
* Diplomatic quarter

**Foundry Row**:
* Industrial kilns and forges
* Varnish accumulation hazard
* Dense worker housing
* High creature outbreak risk

**The Tangles**:
* Warehouse district
* Smuggling corridors

* Syndic patrol routes

**Crown Square**:
* Wealthy residential
* Beghel Syndic offices

### Story Hooks

* Beghel Syndic corruption case
* Warehouse district outbreak
* Dockworker uprising
* Telegraph intelligence theft

### Thematic Hooks (Dream/Dominion/Time/Territory)

**Dream**: Admiralty Heights telegraph operators sharing identical nightmares. Circuit memory spreading through the repeater network. Workers wake knowing things about ships that haven't arrived yet.

**Dominion**: Tidemark workers increasingly docile. Foundry Row foremen realize the workforce isn't loyal — they're *tuned*. Dregs market flourishes because compliance sells.

**Time**: Contract disputes where both parties remember different durations. Telegraph logs don't match operator memory. "Signal drift" used as legal defense and legal weapon.

**Territory**: The Tangles are contested ground where geographic, somatic, and cognitive territory all blur. Long-term warehouse workers can't be certain which memories are theirs.

## 2) SHAREM

**sha-rem** — "Pit Deep" *(Georgian: ch'a → sha, sirem from sighrme)*

### Classification

Major terrace metropolis; extraction hub; vertical city

### Geography

* Terraced crater city in Sharekeoba (Pale Pit Country)
* Vertical districts descending into pit

* Pale-Gilled infestation
* 200+ deaths
* Rumors of survivors
* Entry forbidden

### Story Hooks

* Claim jumping violence
* Pressure wake accident
* Sealed Terrace expedition
* Pale-Gilled nest purge
* Extraction sabotage

### Thematic Hooks (Dream/Dominion/Time/Territory)

**Dream**: The Sealed Terrace survivors (if any exist) have been dreaming together for fifteen years. What have they become? What do they remember? Expedition teams return with memories of people they never met.

**Dominion**: Deep pit workers are the most compliant in Selnara. Is it the isolation? The dregs? Or has something in the seeps been cultivating them? Claim bosses prefer "reliable" workers — and the supply is endless.

**Time**: How long has the Sealed Terrace been sealed? Records say fifteen years. Survivors (rumored) say it's been longer. Or shorter. Time moves differently down there.

**Territory**: Every terrace level is a claim. Your body accumulates contamination as you descend. By the time you own a deep claim, the deep claim owns you.

## 3) KARESHTUL

**karesh-tul** — "Gate Lock" *(Georgian: karibche → karesh, tula → tul)*

### Classification

Major lock-fort; river chokepoint; corridor control city

### Geography

### Story Hooks

* Quarantine breakdown
* Contaminated cargo smuggling
* Lock sabotage
* Blockade standoff
* Creature infestation in spillways

### Thematic Hooks (Dream/Dominion/Time/Territory)

**Dream**: Quarantine inspectors begin sharing dreams about cargo they've never seen. Is it Signal contamination from the inspection coils? Or something in the river itself?

**Dominion**: Kareshtul controls the corridor. The corridor controls the economy. But who controls Kareshtul? The lock-masters are calm, efficient, certain. Too certain. Too calm.

**Time**: Lock scheduling is exact. But upstream and downstream witnesses disagree on transit times. Ships arrive "on schedule" but crews insist the passage took days longer. Or shorter.

**Territory**: Kareshkalak is the ultimate chokepoint — geographic territory that grants cognitive dominion. If you control what passes through, you control what people know.

### Thematic Hooks (Dream/Dominion/Time/Territory)

**Dream**: Skyframe crews work in the highest Grey Current concentrations. They dream of storms that haven't happened yet — or have they? Circuit memory from previous crews, previous storms, previous deaths.

**Dominion**: Khergem Brokers sell time. They also sell certainty — weather forecasts that make trade predictable. What if the forecasts aren't predictions but *instructions*? What if the storms come when they're scheduled?

**Time**: "Minutes on the manifold" is the ultimate time commodity. But Broker records and client memories never quite align. Charging time is extorted, stolen, or simply *lost* — and no one can prove which.

**Territory**: The ridge is geographic territory. The charge is economic territory. The forecast is cognitive territory. Metasafek controls all three — and the Compact intends to keep it.
