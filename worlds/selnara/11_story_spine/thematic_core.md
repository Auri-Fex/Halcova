# Thematic Story Core — Dream/Dominion + Time/Territory

## Status: LOCKED

This document defines the thematic spine for stories in Selnara. All narrative elements should reinforce these integrated concepts.

---

## COSMOLOGICAL INTEGRATION

The four thematic pillars now operate within the cosmological framework:

- **Selnara** = world of the living
- **Ashra** = underworld / land of the dead (appears as "Earth")
- Daily death (**Kharven**) and resurrection (**Narret**) as natural cycle
- Memory anchors connect living and dead

The existing themes gain new depth through this lens:
- **Dream** = contamination AND death-bleed between worlds
- **Dominion** = cognitive colonization AND parasitic control
- **Time** = commodity/weapon AND the different flows between worlds
- **Territory** = fractal dispossession AND claims across life/death boundary

---

## THE FOUR PILLARS

### 1) DREAM — Contamination Residue

**Core concept**: Dreams are not prophecy or magic. They are **exposure artifacts** — perception contamination from Signal Pale saturation AND bleed from the death-resurrection cycle.

**How it manifests**:
- Prolonged Signal exposure causes dream-bleed between workers in shared circuits
- High-Signal environments (telegraph stations, repeater junctions) create *residue sleep*
- You don't dream your own memories — you dream what the *circuit* remembers
- Signal Mimics don't just lure during waking hours — they nest in shared dream-space
- **Cosmological layer**: Dreams may also be partial awareness of Ashra during Kharven—or Selnara awareness bleeding into Ashra "sleep"

**The horror**:
- You can't tell which memories are yours
- You wake knowing things you shouldn't
- You feel grief for people you never met
- You remember protocols you never learned — and follow them
- **Cosmological horror**: Are these memories from the circuit—or from your other self, dying and resurrecting?

**Mechanical integration**:
- This is an extension of Signal Pale's documented "behavioral drift"
- Not telepathy — *contamination*
- Not prophecy — *residue*

**Key phrase**: *"The circuit remembers. You just carry it."*

---

### 2) DOMINION — Cognitive Colonization

**Core concept**: Dominion is not about kings or armies. It's about **who owns your preferences**—and who feeds on your existence.

**How it manifests**:
- Signal Pale doesn't *force* obedience — it cultivates it
- Latchhands become "calmer, more compliant" through their work
- Pale Dregs monetize docility (already canon: "quieting paste")
- Populations under prolonged Signal exposure show *preference drift* — they want what the system needs them to want
- **Cosmological layer**: The parasite feeds during Ashra-time. Compliance may be cultivated to make feeding easier.

**The horror**:
- The terrifying question: *When did I start wanting this?*
- Discovering your preferences have been shaped from inside
- The Signal didn't make you do anything — it made you *want* to do it
- You've been governed, and you defended the governing
- **Cosmological horror**: The parasite doesn't force you to die daily—it made you need to. Sleep feels necessary because you've been optimized to feed it.

**Mechanical integration**:
- Behavioral drift is already documented for Latchhands
- Pale Dregs already cause "low-reactivity" and "social compliance"
- This extends these effects to their logical, horrifying conclusion

**Key phrase**: *"The dream of freedom is also installed."*

---

### 3) TIME — Commodity and Weapon

**Core concept**: Time is both **economic resource** and **perceptual weapon**—and it flows differently between worlds.

**How it manifests**:

*Economic*:
- "Minutes on the manifold" already commodifies charging time
- Weather forecasting is strategic intelligence — knowing *when* is power
- Jar instability creates hard time pressure
- Contracts measured in time become weapons when perception is compromised

*Perceptual*:
- Memory shearing disrupts sequence ("missing minutes, wrong ordering, false certainty")
- High-Signal environments cause temporal dysphoria — you're certain of the sequence, but the sequence is wrong
- Witnesses disagree on duration; records don't match memory
- Institutions exploit the gap: *"The contract says three days. You feel like it was longer, but that's Signal drift."*

*Cosmological*:
- Selnara time and Ashra time do not run 1:1
- A "day" in Selnara may be hours in Ashra, or vice versa
- Memory anchors can span decades of Ashra time
- The parasite's feeding cycle creates the fundamental rhythm

**The horror**:
- The nightmare isn't that time passes — it's that you can't prove it did
- You lose arguments about your own experience
- Extortion becomes impossible to verify
- Your certainty is evidence against you

**Mechanical integration**:
- Latchhand "memory shearing" is already canon
- Signal Pale "false certainty" is documented
- Charging time as commodity is built into Khergem Broker economics

**Key phrase**: *"Time is money. Memory is debt."*

---

### 4) TERRITORY — Fractal Dispossession

**Core concept**: Territory operates at **three simultaneous scales**, and the same logic applies to all of them—including the boundary between life and death.

**Geographic territory**:
- Claim Rings, Spine monopolies, corridor chokepoints
- "Hold what you can defend"
- Violence enforces boundaries
- Dispossession is constant threat

**Somatic territory (Body)**:
- The body as circuit component
- Contamination *claims* tissue: varnish pathways, ash in reflexes
- Exposure accumulates — the territory marks you
- You can win a claim war while the pit claims *you*

**Cognitive territory (Mind)**:
- Preferences, memories, dreams — interior space is colonizable
- Signal work drifts your will toward compliance
- Dream-bleed fills you with others' memories
- Your certainty about your own history can be contested

**Existential territory (Life/Death)**:
- Memory anchors are claims on your existence
- Factions in Selnara control resurrection access
- Territory in Ashra = power over who returns to life
- Your very existence can be contested across worlds

**The horror**:
- Losing any of them feels the same — dispossession
- You can fight for geographic territory while losing somatic and cognitive territory
- Victory becomes indistinguishable from defeat
- The claim you defended has already claimed you
- **Cosmological horror**: Even death is not escape—you can be claimed, owned, controlled in both worlds

**Mechanical integration**:
- Geographic claims are built into Claim Rings and Khergem Brokers
- Somatic degradation is already canon for Latchhands (tremors, seizures, nerve damage)
- Cognitive drift is documented in Signal Pale effects

**Key phrase**: *"Every claim costs something. The question is what you're paying with."*

---

## SYNTHESIS: THE NIGHTMARE LOGIC

The four pillars collapse into a single horror:

> **The system works exactly as designed. The nightmare is that you've been participating willingly — and you can't prove otherwise.**

- Dreams install false memories that justify compliance
- Dominion makes you want what serves the infrastructure
- Time-perception drift makes your objections unreliable
- Territory logic means you're claimed while claiming

**The Signal didn't break you. It optimized you.**

### Cosmological Synthesis

> **You die every day. You've always died every day. You can't remember a time when you didn't—because there isn't one. The parasite made sure of that.**

The cosmology adds another layer:
- Death itself is routine, normalized, necessary-feeling
- The parasite feeds on you while you "rest"
- Even those who know cannot stop the cycle
- Escape to Selnara permanently means your Ashra self dies—and everyone who loved that person forgets

**The nightmare is that both lives are real, and you can never be fully present in either.**

## STORY STRUCTURES ENABLED

### Primary Mode: Noir Investigation (Internal Mystery)

A compromised protagonist investigates a case that leads *inward*:
- What happened to me?
- What did I agree to?
- Whose memories am I carrying?
- When did my preferences change?
- **Cosmological**: Who am I in Ashra? What have I done there?

The mystery isn't "who did it" — it's "what have I become?"

### Secondary Mode: Ensemble Echo

Supporting characters may be:
- Real people the protagonist has wrongly merged with (dream-bleed)
- Memory-residue from the circuit
- Signal echoes that feel like colleagues
- Genuinely separate people who share contaminated memories
- **Cosmological**: People known only in Ashra, or only in Selnara, bleeding through

Readers (and protagonist) cannot be certain which is which.

### Tertiary Mode: Systemic Horror

The investigation reveals:
- The system works as designed
- Protocols are both safety and weapon
- "Respectable cruelty" scales perfectly
- The rot goes all the way down — including into the investigator
- **Cosmological**: The death-resurrection cycle is not broken—it's working perfectly. For something.

### Quaternary Mode: Cross-World Intrigue (NEW)

Stories that span Selnara and Ashra:
- Faction agents operating in the underworld
- Assassination requiring death in both worlds
- Memory anchor warfare
- The Awakened organizing against the cycle
- The Hollow as environmental threat

---

## PROTAGONIST ARCHETYPES (High-Potential)

### 1) The Tuned Investigator

A Latchhand inspector whose "professional calm" is revealed as damage. Case leads to discovering their preferences were installed. Must solve external mystery while losing internal certainty.

### 2) The Drifted Operator

A telegraph operator with dream-bleed symptoms. Knows things they shouldn't. Follows protocols they never learned. Must determine which memories are theirs before the Mimics finish nesting.

### 3) The Compliant Foreman

A refinery supervisor who realizes the workforce isn't loyal — they're *tuned*. Must confront their own complicity in the tuning while the system defends itself through their own preferences.

### 4) The Disputed Witness

Someone whose testimony is contested because their time-sense is compromised. Must prove their experience against institutional records and their own documented drift.

### 5) The Awakened Agent (NEW)

Someone in Ashra who has awakened to the truth. Works for a Selnara faction—or against them all. Must navigate the underground while avoiding the Hollow.

### 6) The Anchor (NEW)

Someone in Selnara whose memory keeps another person alive in Ashra. Discovering this power—and the factions who want to control or destroy it.

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CANON

This thematic spine:
- **Extends** Signal Pale behavioral drift to its logical horror conclusion
- **Extends** Latchhand degradation to include cognitive territory loss
- **Extends** dream-reference in Pale Dregs ("sleep through storms") to contamination-sleep
- **Extends** Signal Mimic psychology to dream-nesting
- **Does not add** new metaphysical systems
- **Does not violate** the "no free-standing magic" rule
- **Does not create** prophecy, telepathy, or fate mechanics

All phenomena are **exposure artifacts** — contamination, not supernatural gifts.

---

## TONAL CALIBRATION

**Primary register**: Mind horror (systemic)

The horror is discovering the system works exactly as designed — and you've been serving it efficiently.

**Secondary register**: Body horror (accumulated)

Not sudden transformation, but gradual claiming. Varnish in tissue. Ash in reflexes. Signal in certainty.

**Tertiary register**: Institutional horror (respectable cruelty)

Protocols weaponized. Documentation as control. "For your safety" as threat.
