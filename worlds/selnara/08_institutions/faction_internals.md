## BEGHEL SYNDICS

### Power Structure

**The Conclave**: Ruling body of major house heads
- Meets quarterly in Zevakalak
- Decisions require two-thirds majority
- Minor houses have observer status only
- Real deals happen in private before votes

**House Hierarchy**:
1. **Great Houses** (5) — Conclave voting members
2. **Major Houses** (12) — Regional influence, advisory voice
3. **Minor Houses** (40+) — Local operations, no political voice
4. **Affiliated Firms** — Licensed but not blood-tied

### The Great Houses

| House | Base | Specialty | Current Head |
|-------|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Beghelis-Kalak** | Zevakalak | Maritime authentication | Patriarch Sulkhan Beghelis (67) |
| **Beghelis-Karesh** | Kareshtul | Transit documentation | Matriarch Rusudan Beghelis (54) |

- Trade disrupted between coastal and pit regions
- Navsad Piers arbitration ongoing for three years

**Minor House Resentment**:
