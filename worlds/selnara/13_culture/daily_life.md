**Shift types**:
- **Day shift** — Sunrise to sunset (most common)

### Weekly Rhythm

**Six-day work week** standard, with:

**Temporal anxiety**: In Signal-rich environments:

## BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS

### Death Beliefs

**The Selnari do not know the cosmological truth.** Their death beliefs are tragic irony:

**Common beliefs**:
- Death is final (wrong — it's just extended Kharven)
- The dead "rest" (true, but not as they imagine)
- Dreams sometimes contain messages from the dead (accidentally correct)
- Sleep is "the little death" (more accurate than they know)

**Funeral customs**:
- **Burning** common (coastal, ridge) — "release to the air"
- **Burial** common (pit regions) — "return to the deep"
- **Memorial beghels** — Family marks recording lineage
- **Mourning period** — 7–30 days depending on status

**Beliefs about dreams**:
- Dreams are "echoes of the day" (partial truth)
- Shared dreams are "coincidence" (denial of reality)
- Bad dreams come from "Signal exposure" (partly true)
- Dream-telling is minor fortune-telling tradition

### Sleep Customs

**Sleep anxiety** is culturally significant:

- "Sleep well" — Standard farewell
- "May you wake clear" — Blessing for troubled sleepers
- Insomnia is shameful (seen as moral failing)
- Oversleeping is suspicious (laziness or illness)
- "Sleeping too deep" — Euphemism for death

**Sleep aids**:
- Herbal teas (common, mild)
- Nerve-settle (stronger, medicinal)
- Dregs (Pale Medium byproduct — dangerous, addictive)

### Family and Marriage

**Beghel-certified unions**:
- Marriage requires Syndic authentication
- Creates legal claim to property, inheritance
- Divorce requires Navsad Pier arbitration
- "Unbegehled unions" — Common among workers, no legal standing

**Family structure**:
- **Nuclear standard** in cities
- **Extended clans** in frontier regions
- **House families** among Syndics/Brokers (political units)
- **Claim families** — Linked by extraction rights, not blood

**Inheritance**:
- Beghel-certified descent determines claims
- Disputed inheritance = Navsad Pier arbitration
- "Blood beghels" — Expensive authentication of lineage
- Adoption possible but requires Syndic process

### Social Customs

**Greetings**:
- Handshake (equals)
- Slight bow (to superiors)
- Hat tip (acknowledgment without engagement)
- Beghel flash (showing house mark — professional contexts)

**Hospitality**:
- Offering kavatei to guests is standard
- Refusing offered drink is mild insult
- "Breaking bread" — Sharing food creates social obligation
- Guest rights in Standard Enclaves are sacred

**Reputation markers**:
- Beghel marks on documents
- Letters of introduction
- "Known at" — Being recognized at reputable establishments
- "Vouched for" — Someone of standing attesting to character
