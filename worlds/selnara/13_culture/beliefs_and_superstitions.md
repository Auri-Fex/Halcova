# Beliefs and Superstitions

## Status: LOCKED

Religious practices, folk beliefs, and superstitions in Selnara — a world that doesn't know its own cosmological truth.

## THE ABSENCE OF ORGANIZED RELIGION

### Why No Churches?

Selnara has **no dominant organized religion**. Several factors:

1. **The Signal's presence** — Measurable, practical, exploitable. Why pray when you can charge?
2. **Industrial rationalism** — Broker and Syndic culture emphasizes pragmatic materialism
3. **Historical fracturing** — Whatever pre-Emergence beliefs existed didn't survive the chaos
4. **Memory instability** — Hard to maintain religious tradition when memory shears

**Result**: Scattered folk beliefs, localized practices, no unified theology.

## FOLK BELIEFS ABOUT DEATH

### The Great Ignorance

**The Selnari do not know**:
- That Ashra exists (the dream-realm of the dead)
- That consciousness persists after death
- That their dreams sometimes touch the dead
- That "sleep" and "death" are cosmologically linked

**What they believe instead**:

**"The Quiet"** — Most common belief:
- Death is silence, ending, peace
- The dead "rest" in undefined way
- Continuation would be exhausting; rest is mercy
- "May you find the Quiet" — funeral blessing

**"The Return"** — Minority belief:
- Death returns body to the world
- Consciousness disperses into everything
- "We become the air, the water, the stone"
- Popular among extraction workers (makes contamination death meaningful)

**"The Echo"** — Superstitious variant:
- The dead leave impressions
- Places remember who died there
- Explains hauntings, bad feelings
- Not quite ghosts, but resonance

### Funeral Practices

**Cremation** (Coastal, Ridge):
- "Release to the air"
- Ashes scattered or kept
- Quick, clean, practical
- Beghelis families have elaborate ceremonies

**Burial** (Pit Regions):
- "Return to the deep"
- Often in terrace cemeteries
- Depth of burial = status
- Deep Sharem has mass graves for workers

**Memorial Beghels**:
- Syndic practice spreading to middle class
- Authenticated record of death
- Family lineage documentation
- "Sealed into the record"

### The Tragic Irony

**What actually happens**:
- Consciousness enters extended Kharven (sleep-state)
- Eventually reaches Ashra
- Experiences dream-existence until reincarnation cycle
- The dead are not "resting" — they're waiting

**What the living almost notice**:
- Dreams sometimes feel like "visits"
- Shared dreams with recently deceased (dismissed as grief)
- Sense of presence in sleep (attributed to memory)
- Near-death experiences (rationalized away)

## BELIEFS ABOUT SLEEP AND DREAMS

### Sleep Anxiety

Sleep is **culturally fraught** in Selnara:

**"The Little Death"**:
- Sleep as rehearsal for death
- Vulnerability, loss of control
- Must be managed, controlled
- Oversleeping is suspicious

**Sleep Blessings**:
- "Sleep well" — Standard farewell
- "May you wake clear" — For troubled sleepers
- "Light dreams" — Hoping for forgettable dreams
- "Return to us" — For the seriously ill

**Sleep Disorders**:
- Insomnia seen as moral/spiritual failing
- "Can't face the dark" — Accusation
- Oversleeping seen as laziness or illness
- Sleep-talking taken very seriously

### Dream Beliefs

**"Day echoes"** — Dominant explanation:
- Dreams are memory processing
- Nothing meaningful, just noise
- Rational, scientific-ish
- Officially encouraged by Enclaves

**"Night messages"** — Folk belief:
- Dreams sometimes carry meaning
- Deceased relatives may visit
- Warnings about the future
- Dismissed by educated classes

**"Signal bleed"** — Technical explanation:
- Dreams affected by Signal exposure
- Latchhands have stranger dreams
- Contamination causes nightmares
- Partially true, but misses bigger picture

**Dream-tellers**:
- Minor fortune-telling tradition
- Interpret dreams for meaning
- Considered entertainment, not serious
- Some have genuine partial insight (unknowing)

### The Partial Truth

**Dreams in Selnara actually**:
- Sometimes genuinely connect to Ashra
- Can receive impressions from the dead
- Are affected by Signal (which touches Ashra)
- More significant than anyone realizes

**Why they don't figure it out**:
- Memory shearing prevents pattern recognition
- Rationalist culture dismisses anomalies
- No framework to interpret correctly
- The truth is too strange to accept

## SIGNAL-RELATED BELIEFS

### The Signal as Phenomenon

**Official position** (Broker/Enclave):
- Natural force, like electricity
- Exploitable through proper technique
- Dangerous but manageable
- No spiritual dimension

**Folk beliefs**:

**"The Pulse"**:
- Signal has its own rhythm
- Some days stronger than others
- Latchhands can "feel" it
- Weather and mood connected

**"Signal sickness"**:
- Too much exposure changes you
- Not just contamination — personality shifts
- Latchhands become "other"
- Partially true (Revenant Potential)

**"The Whisper"**:
- Sometimes Signal seems to communicate
- Patterns that feel meaningful
- Messages in the static
- Officially nonsense; occasionally accurate

### Latchhand Beliefs

**Among practitioners**:

**"The Gift"**:
- Ability is innate, not learned
- Some people "have it"
- Training only shapes what's there
- Veterans debate nature vs. nurture

**"The Price"**:
- Every technique costs something
- Not just physical — something deeper
- You trade pieces of yourself
- Universal among experienced latchhands

**"The Current"**:
- Experienced practitioners sense... something
- Like swimming in invisible river
- Goes somewhere, comes from somewhere
- Nobody knows where

**"Burning out"**:
- Latchhands who use too much, too fast
- Lose ability, sometimes lose mind
- Become "hollow" — present but absent
- Feared outcome, whispered about

### The Hidden Truth

**What latchhands actually touch**:
- Signal connects to the Ashra-Selnara boundary
- They're manipulating death-energy without knowing
- "The Current" is real — it flows between realms
- "Burning out" may involve partial soul damage
