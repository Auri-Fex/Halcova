# Geographic World Logic

## The Four-Part System

Selnara's primary play region is a four-part system:

1. **Saltwind Littoral** (coast)
2. **Pale Pits** (interior ringpit country)
3. **Stone River** (civilization spine)
4. **Shear Desert** (edge / dead reaches)

This is the practical geography that supports "port noir + pit frontier + corridor empire."

## The Key Physical Truth

Settlements form around:

* **charging access**
* **Medium extraction**
* **refining sites**
* **safe corridors**

...more than around food or traditional "gold."

## Major Regions

### 1. Selina

**sel-ina** — Saltwind Littoral (fossil simplification)

Coastal region characterized by:
* Treaty-port noir cities
* Standard Enclaves with hardware-based borders
* Dense industrial docks and warehouses
* Syndicate control and seal counterfeit markets

### 2. Kharveth

**khar-veth** — Pale Pit Terraces / ringpit country

Interior extraction zones:
* Terraced crater metropolises
* Pale Medium extraction sites
* Vertical city violence
* Claim rings and territory battles

### 3. Nartul

**nar-tul** — River Locklands

Civilization spine along major waterway:
* Lock-fort chokepoint cities
* Quarantine as routine
* Corridor control determines power
* Token and gear mark access systems

### 4. Shethassa

**shet-hassa** — Shear Desert Basins

Edge territories and dead reaches:
* Storm shear zones
* Grey Current capture sites
* Boom/bust depot settlements
* Dangerous trade routes

### 5. Girven

**gir-ven** — Stormspine ridge settlements / old towns

Highland spine regions:
* Skyframe harvesting sites
* Grey Current primary capture
* Old established towns
* Storm shear events common
