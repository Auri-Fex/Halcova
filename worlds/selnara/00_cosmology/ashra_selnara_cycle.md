# The Ashra-Selnara Cycle — Cosmological Foundation

## Status: LOCKED

This document defines the fundamental cosmological truth underlying Selnara: the relationship between the world of the living and the underworld.

---

## THE CORE TRUTH

**Selnara is the world of the living. Ashra is the underworld—the land of the dead.**

Every Selnari dies daily. Every morning, they are resurrected.

From Selnara's perspective:
- Sleep is death (Kharven)
- Waking is resurrection (Narret)
- The parasite feeds on the dead

From Ashra's perspective:
- Living your life is existing in the afterlife
- Going to sleep means being available for resurrection
- "Dreaming" is being temporarily alive again in Selnara
- Waking is dying again, returning to the underworld

---

## FRAGMENTATION: THE HIDDEN TRUTH

### The Real Horror

**Every person in Ashra is not a separate being from their Selnara counterpart. They are the same consciousness, fragmented into two forms.**

When a person dies in Selnara:
- Their consciousness does not move to Ashra
- Instead, it **shatters across the boundary**
- One fragment exists in Selnara as the **summons** (the "dead" form—whatever that being actually looks like)
- One fragment exists in Ashra as a **human form** (reconstructed from memory, history, identity)

### The Two Forms

**Ashra Form (The Human Shape):**
- Constructed from how the person lived and how they are remembered
- Appears as a living human being
- Carries only pre-death memories (Silas's memories, not Tavosh's)
- Believes itself to be alive and does not remember death
- Lives a "normal" life in Ashra

**Selnara Form (The Summons):**
- The being as it actually is in death—not human
- Remembers being summoned, knows about the cycle
- Aware of the Ashra fragment (Silas)
- Desperate to keep both fragments alive through compulsion-bleed
- Subject to testing and culling

### How Fragmentation Works

One consciousness, split across two realities:
- **Ashra consciousness:** Ashra-self's pre-death memories, beliefs, identity
- **Selnara consciousness:** Selnara-self's full knowledge of being dead
- **Communication:** One-way compulsion bleed (Selnara → Ashra)
- **Dormancy:** When in one form, the other is unconscious
- **Survival:** Both must remain alive—death in either form kills both

### The Memory Anchor's Real Meaning

Memory doesn't just sustain the summons. **It sustains the human form itself.**

- People in Selnara remember the person as they were in life
- These memories literally construct and maintain the Ashra form
- The Ashra person appears human BECAUSE they are remembered as human
- If everyone forgets them: the human form becomes unstable, then impossible
- The "human" is not a given—it's a collective hallucination made real by memory

### Appearance and Memory

The Ashra form is not arbitrary. It reflects:
- How they lived (clothing, mannerisms, bearing)
- How they are remembered (physical traits from memory)
- How they understand themselves (can shift slightly with self-perception)
- The curse or nature of their death (might influence features)

**Example:** Tavosh was remembered as a professional, so Silas appears as a working adult. If Selnara people forget him, Silas's human form begins to blur and degrade.

## TERMINOLOGY (LOCKED)

### Ashra
**ash-ra** — The underworld / land of the dead / Earth

- Constructed from **ash** (residue/waste) + **-a** (realm ending)
- Meaning: "The Residue Realm" or "The Hollow World"
- What Selnari call the place they go when they die
- From Ashra's perspective: this is reality (they don't know they're dead)

### Kharven
**khar-ven** — Going dormant / dying / descending to Ashra

- Constructed from **khar** (pit/hollow) + **-ven** (going/becoming)
- Meaning: "Entering the hollow" or "Going to the pit"
- The daily death that sends consciousness to Ashra
- From Ashra perspective: falling asleep

### Tulren
**tul-ren** — Being banished / forced death / violent severance

- Constructed from **tul** (lock/gate) + **-ren** (being acted upon)
- Meaning: "Being locked out" or "Being gated away"
- Forced Kharven—sudden, violent, without warning
- From Ashra perspective: being knocked unconscious, fainting

### Narret
**nar-ret** — Returning / resurrection / flowing back to life

- Constructed from **nar** (river/flow) + **ret** (return)
- Meaning: "The flowing return" or "Drifting back"
- The daily resurrection that brings consciousness back to Selnara
- From Ashra perspective: waking from sleep

---

## THE CYCLE

### Normal Cycle (Daily Death and Resurrection)

1. **Living in Selnara**: Consciousness animates Selnara body. Full life.
2. **Kharven approaching**: 6-10 Ashra-hours since last resurrection. The pull begins.
3. **Transition**: Gradual—heaviness, unfocused thoughts, narrowing vision. Then blackout.
4. **Existence in Ashra**: Consciousness in Ashra body. Perceived as normal life there.
5. **Being marked available**: Ashra-sleep signals readiness for resurrection.
6. **Narret**: Pulled back to Selnara. Blackout gap—no transition memory.
7. **Return to Selnara**: Waking in Selnara body. The cycle continues.

### Abnormal States

| State | Selnara Truth | Ashra Experience |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Extended Kharven | Someone staying dead longer | Oversleeping, extended rest |
| Resisting Kharven | Clinging to life past the timer | Cannot fall asleep (insomnia) |
| Forced Tulren | Being killed/banished suddenly | Sudden unconsciousness, fainting |
| Blocked Narret | Unable to resurrect | Coma (Ashra body), trapped in life (Selnara) |
| Permanent resurrection | Living without death | Coma patient (Ashra body empty) |

### Time Compression

Selnara time and Ashra time do not run 1:1.

- A Selnari can live a full "day" (20-40 Selnara-hours) in Selnara
- This corresponds to roughly 6-10 hours in Ashra
- The ratio varies—time flows differently between worlds

---

## THE PARASITE

### Nature

The parasite is not fully defined—it may be:
- The underworld itself (Ashra as organism)
- A keeper/lord of the dead
- A cosmic entity that feeds on the death-resurrection cycle
- Something that was always there, or something that was created/invited

What is known:
- It requires regular feeding from the dead
- It maintains the Ashra-Selnara connection
- It pulls consciousness to Ashra for feeding periods
- It releases consciousness back to Selnara when fed
- **It has physical presence in Selnara through Pale Medium**

### Physical Manifestation (LOCKED)

**Pale Medium is the parasite's substance in the world of the living.**

The Grey Current / Pale Medium / Charged Pale industrial system is, unknowingly, a system for harvesting and refining the parasite's presence:

| Element | Cosmological Truth |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Grey Current** | Boundary energy released by the death-resurrection cycle |
| **Pale Medium** | The parasite's physical body bleeding into Selnara |
| **Charged Pale** | Parasitic substance activated by boundary energy |
| **Signal Pale** | The fraction that retains most parasitic influence |
| **Creatures** | Extensions/offspring serving the parasite |

The Selnari have built an economy around extracting, refining, and consuming the thing that feeds on them.

> See: 02_power_systems/ for full technical treatment

### Feeding Mechanism

The parasite feeds on those in Ashra. The feeding cycle is:
- 6-10 Ashra-hours of existence in the underworld
- During this time, the parasite consumes... something (life force, essence, energy)
- When feeding is complete, the person can be resurrected
- Resistance or interruption of feeding causes problems

### The Hollow — Immune Response

**The Hollow** are the parasite's antibodies—not agents, but reactions.

What they are:
- People with no memory anchors to Selnara
- Either never truly alive (Ashra-native) or fully severed from Selnara
- They feel *wrong*—something off about them that the Awakened learn to sense

What they do:
- Drawn to disruptions in the feeding cycle (Awakened, resisters)
- Don't know why they do what they do—compulsion, not mission
- Not coordinated—immune response, not army
- Can be confused, reasoned with (sometimes), even turned

How they manifest:
- Environmental pressure first (bad luck, relationships souring, isolation)
- Physical manifestation only when pressure isn't enough
- Each is unique—broken in different ways

---

## THE MEMORY ANCHOR

### Core Rule

Your existence in Ashra depends on being **meaningfully remembered** in Selnara.

But this is deeper than mere survival—**memory literally constructs your human form.**

### The Anchor Relationship

The fragmented person has two forms:
- **Selnara form:** The summons, the non-human being, the dead self
- **Ashra form:** The human reconstructed from memory and identity

The summons (Selnara) is kept alive through being remembered by Selnara people. But those memories also construct and maintain the human form (Ashra). The anchor is bidirectional:

**Memory ↔ Summons ↔ Ashra Human**

If the summons is forgotten, the Ashra human loses coherence and fades. If the Ashra human dies, the summons loses its anchor to existence and ceases. Neither can exist without the other.

### Anchor Strength and Form Stability

| Anchor Type | Strength | Effect on Human Form |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Intimate knowledge (lover, close family, best friend) | Strong—single person can sustain you | Form is stable, detailed, recognizable |
| Meaningful relationship (colleague, neighbor, mentor) | Medium—needs a few people | Form is present but vague in details |
| Casual familiarity (acquaintance, customer) | Weak—needs many people | Form flickers, unstable, easily forgotten |
| Knows of you (heard name, saw you once) | Negligible—not a real anchor | Form barely exists, easily erased |
| Completely forgotten | None | Form dissolves entirely—true death |

### What Forgetting Looks Like

When someone is forgotten in Selnara:
- The Ashra person begins to lose coherence
- Memory gaps appear—they forget their own name
- Physical form becomes unstable—features blur
- Identity fragments—they don't know who they are
- Eventually: complete dissolution—they cease to exist

### Anchor Decay

Anchors fade when:
- Anchor-person dies → memories transfer to their anchors, or break entirely
- Anchor-person forgets you → anchor weakens, form degradation begins
- Anchor-person deliberately forgets → anchor severs suddenly, rapid fading
- Anchor-person's memory corrupted → form becomes distorted and unstable

### The Forgotten

People in Ashra with no remaining anchors. They fade. Their human form dissolves. **True death in both worlds.**

---

## COMPULSION BLEED

### The Hidden Mechanism

Most Ashra residents experience a phenomenon they interpret as their own "good ideas," "gut instincts," or "morning clarity." In reality, these are **thoughts and urges bleeding through from their Selnara counterpart**.

### How It Works

- The Selnara summons (ghost) is aware of the Ashra anchor's existence
- The summons has urgent, survival-driven concerns about the anchor's health
- These concerns manifest as *thoughts* in the Ashra mind
- The Ashra person interprets these as their own epiphanies: "I should work out more," "I need to eat better," "I should focus harder at work"

### Why It Happens

The Selnara summons is desperate. If the Ashra anchor degrades, dies, or fails, the summons ceases to exist. This creates intense pressure to optimize the anchor:

- Keep the body healthy and strong
- Maintain mental sharpness
- Avoid dangerous situations
- Build stable relationships (anchor people in the Ashra person's life)
- Maintain employment or status (proof of worth/continuation)

### What It Feels Like (Ashra POV)

| Experience | Actual Truth |
|------------|--------------|
| "I just had a thought—I should go running" | Selnara summons transmitted urgency about physical fitness |
| "I feel like I need to sleep more" | Selnara summons concerned about cognitive function |
| "I'm being more social lately" | Selnara summons trying to maintain Ashra relationships that sustain memory |
| "I've been thinking about my health" | Selnara summons in survival panic |
| "Best ideas come right when I wake up" | Compulsion bleed is strongest during sleep-wake transition |

### Physical Manifestations

Compulsion bleed can cause:
- Bruises and injuries from activities the Ashra person doesn't remember starting
- Rope burns from physical testing in Selnara
- Muscle soreness from exertion they didn't consciously undertake
- Smells (industrial, chemical, alchemical) that linger after sleep
- Branded marks or scars from Selnara evaluations

### Why Ashra People Don't Notice

- Most people are unAwakened
- They rationalize: sleepwalking, forgetfulness, coincidence
- The compulsions generally align with societal values (be healthy, work hard, maintain relationships)
- They feel like their own authentic desires

### Danger

Uncontrolled compulsion bleed can cause:
- **Obsessive behavior** — The summons's desperation becomes the anchor's compulsion
- **Self-harm** — Pushing the body beyond safe limits to pass Selnara evaluations
- **Reckless risk-taking** — The summons trying to "test" the anchor's resilience
- **Personality distortion** — Over time, the compulsions reshape who the person becomes
- **Exhaustion and degradation** — The Ashra person worn down by constant unspoken pressure

---

## SUMMONS TESTING AND THE HOLLOWED

### The Testing System

Selnara institutions test their summons (ghosts) to ensure quality:

| Test Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Physical evaluation** | Measuring the anchor body's strength, durability, health |
| **Cognitive assessment** | Testing mental sharpness, pattern recognition, processing speed |
| **Psychological screening** | Measuring stability, compliance, resilience to despair |
| **Anchor stability check** | Verifying the Ashra self is viable and maintainable |

### Who Administers Tests

- **Summons Authority** — Neutral institutional body that evaluates all summons
- **Faction representatives** — Independent evaluators paid by employment factions
- **The Hollowed** — Ambient antibodies of the system, drawn to weak summons

### Test Outcomes

| Result | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Viable** | Continued existence; testing continues periodically |
| **Marginal** | Placed on probation; more frequent testing; restricted work |
| **Degrading** | Marked for intensified observation; last chance period |
| **Culled** | Marked for removal; Ashra anchor is let die (through accident or indirect means) |

### Culling Process

When a summons is marked for culling, the system doesn't directly kill the Ashra anchor. Instead:

- The Selnara side "forgets" about the anchor relationship
- The memories holding the anchor fade rapidly
- The anchor experiences rapid cognitive and physical decline
- Within weeks, the anchor is effectively abandoned
- The Ashra person dies naturally (accident, illness, despair)
- The Selnara summons, now fully forgotten, ceases to exist

### The Horror of Being Tested

From the Ashra POV:
- The anchor person notices they're becoming "less capable"
- They feel pressure to be healthier, sharper, better
- They have no idea they're being evaluated
- They're driven by a desperate compulsion they don't understand
- If they fail the test they don't know they're taking, they die

From the Selnara POV:
- The summons is watching, terrified, trying to "support" their anchor
- They can sense when the evaluation is coming
- They push harder on the compulsion bleed, trying to optimize the anchor
- They experience the pain and desperation directly
- If the anchor fails, they cease to exist

---

## BIDIRECTIONAL EFFECTS

### Ashra Death → Selnara Forgetting

If you're killed in Ashra, the anchors break **from the Ashra side**.

| Ashra Death Type | Selnara Effect |
|------------------|----------------|
| Natural Ashra death (old age, accident) | Gentle fading—people slowly forget, feels natural |
| Violent Ashra death (murder) | Sudden severance—people forget abruptly, disturbingly |
| Pruning (deliberate erasure by the Hollow) | Complete removal—total Selnara memory wipe, as if you never existed |

### Pruning

The most complete erasure:
- Ashra death + complete Selnara forgetting
- Photos remain but no one recognizes the face
- Records exist but feel like clerical errors
- The gap isn't felt—it's just... nothing
- Only other Awakened might notice someone is missing

---

## MEMORY CONTRACTS

Since memory is the currency of afterlife existence, this creates transactions:

### Contract Types

| Contract Type | How It Works |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Legacy contract** | An institution commits to remembering you through ritual/records. As long as the institution exists and performs the ritual, you persist. |
| **Debt contract** | You owe service in Ashra in exchange for maintaining your anchor. Work for the dead to stay dead. |
| **Name inscription** | Your name/essence inscribed in a Selnara artifact. As long as the artifact exists and is known, you persist. |
| **Successor contract** | You train someone to remember you, they train someone, chain continues. Apostolic succession of memory. |

### Service in the Afterlife

Why someone would work in Ashra for Selnara factions:
- Their anchor is weak—they need institutional backing
- Their family in Selnara is protected in exchange
- They owe a debt from their living days
- Better than fading into nothing

---

## COMAS AND DEATH

### Coma States

| Coma Type | Selnara Truth |
|-----------|---------------|
| Standard coma | Fully resurrected in Selnara, living there, can't/won't die to return |
| Coming out of coma | They died in Selnara—murdered, accident, natural causes—returned to Ashra |
| Persistent vegetative state | Resurrected but damaged—Selnara self alive but incomplete |
| Brain death (body alive) | Soul severed entirely—Selnara self died permanently |

### Death Consequences

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Killed in Selnara only | Wake up in Ashra, can be resurrected later—death is temporary |
| Killed in Ashra only | Selnara self can never die properly—insomnia, exhaustion, madness |
| Killed in both | True death. Gone from both worlds. Final. |

---

## THE AWAKENED

### Who They Are

Dead people in Ashra who **remember they lived**. They know Ashra is the afterlife.

### How They Manifest (in Ashra)

- Obsessed with "dreams"
- Keep dream journals, notice patterns
- Recognize other Awakened
- Form underground networks—"conspiracy theorists" to outsiders
- Try to find Selnara allies in Ashra bodies

### Faction Agents

Awakened who work for Selnara powers. Each faction has their own name:
- Operations vary: location, protection, assassination, recruitment
- Personal agendas, competing loyalties, varied methods
- They have Ashra lives too—the work is hidden

---

## CONDITION MAPPING

### From Ashra (Earth) Perspective

| Condition | Afterlife Truth |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Insomnia** | Refusing resurrection—not wanting to go back to Selnara |
| **Narcolepsy** | The Undying—can't stay dead, keeps getting pulled back |
| **Sleep paralysis** | Being summoned but unable to fully resurrect |
| **Sleepwalking** | Something else answered the summons |
| **Schizophrenia** | Hearing both worlds simultaneously—boundary never closes |
| **Dementia** | Memories of life bleeding into death—the old are closer to true-death |
| **Depression/fatigue** | The parasite taking too much |
| **Vivid dreams** | Strong Selnara bleed-through |
| **Déjà vu** | Pattern recognition from Selnara leaking through |
| **Near-death experience** | Glimpsing Selnara during medical crisis |

---

## WARFARE IMPLICATIONS

### On Ashra (Operations in the Underworld)

| Operation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Finding targets | Locating specific people's Ashra-selves for Selnara factions |
| Preventing resurrection | Keeping someone awake (insomnia induction) so they can't be summoned |
| Permanent killing | Murder in Ashra severs the soul from Selnara entirely |
| Protection | Guarding VIPs from Ashra-side assassination |
| Recruitment | Waking other dead to the truth |

### On Selnara (Living World Operations)

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Memorializing someone | Strengthens their Ashra existence |
| Damnatio memoriae | Weakens their Ashra existence |
| Memory magic | Directly manipulating anchors |
| Killing all who remember | Severs all anchors—person fades in Ashra |

### Territory Control

- Control of Ashra geography = control over resurrection access
- Selnara factions have Ashra-side cells loyal to specific living powers
- Wars in Selnara could be won or lost based on Ashra operations
- Assassinating someone in Selnara may not be enough—need to kill them in Ashra too

---

## SUMMONING AND NECROMANCY

Selnari necromancy isn't raising corpses—it's **calling the dead from Ashra**.

### Summoning Types

| Type | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Echo summoning** | Pulling a fragment—they appear ghostly, partial. Ashra self experiences missing time, dissociation. |
| **Full calling** | Forcing complete Narret outside natural cycle—Ashra body collapses (coma). |
| **Binding** | Trapping someone in Selnara, preventing death—Ashra self never wakes up. Permanent resurrection = permanent Ashra-death. |

### The Horror of Being Summoned

- Ripped from afterlife peace
- Might not know you're dead—suddenly in a strange world
- Echo-summoning repeatedly causes degradation—memories fragment, personality splits
- Full calling might feel like **hell**—forced life, unable to rest

---

## INTEGRATION WITH SELNARA SYSTEMS

The cosmological layer is **deeply integrated** with the existing power systems:

### Power System Integration (LOCKED)

| Existing System | Cosmological Truth |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Grey Current | Boundary energy from death-resurrection cycle |
| Pale Medium | The parasite's physical substance in Selnara |
| Charged Pale | Activated parasitic connection |
| Signal Pale effects | Direct parasitic influence on consciousness |
| Preference drift | Compliance cultivation for easier feeding |
| Dream-bleed | Boundary thinning from parasitic contact |
| Creature ecology | Extensions/offspring of the main parasite |

### Necromantic Applications

Because Pale is the parasite's substance, it enables manipulation of the death cycle:

| Application | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Echo summoning | Signal Pale thins boundary, pulls fragments from Ashra |
| Full calling | Charged Pale forces resurrection outside natural cycle |
| Binding | Concentrated Pale prevents Kharven |
| Tulren weapons | Weaponized Pale forces immediate death/banishment |
| Memory devices | Pale crystallizes or disrupts memory anchors |

> See: 02_power_systems/necromantic_applications.md for full treatment

### The Horror Deepened

The integration creates layered horror:

- The **industrial system** is unknowing parasitology
- Every **device powered by Pale** is a transaction with the cosmic system
- **Compliance** isn't a side effect—it's the primary product
- **Creatures** aren't pests—they're parasitic infrastructure
- The **economy** is built on consuming the thing that feeds on you

---

## WRITER'S NOTES

### What This Enables

- Stories told from Ashra (Earth) perspective, where characters discover the truth
- Stories told from Selnara perspective, where death is routine and resurrection is expected
- Cross-world intrigue and warfare
- Horror of realizing you're dead (Ashra POV)
- Horror of realizing death isn't final (Selnara POV)

### What This Is NOT

- Not The Matrix (simulation/tech)
- Not generic fantasy afterlife
- The relationship is parasitic, not punitive or redemptive
- Both worlds are real—one is life, one is death, but both have genuine existence
