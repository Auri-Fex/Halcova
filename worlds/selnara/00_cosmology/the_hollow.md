# The Hollow — Parasitic Immune Response

## Status: LOCKED

The Hollow are the parasite's **antibodies**—not agents, but organic reactions to threats against the feeding cycle.

---

## WHAT THEY ARE

### Not Agents

The Hollow are **not** dispatched, coordinated, or aware they serve anything. They are:

- Immune reactions given form
- People drawn by compulsion, not mission
- Unique individuals, each broken differently
- Capable of being confused, reasoned with, even turned

### Origin Possibilities

The Hollow have no memory anchors to Selnara. This happens through:

1. **Pruned survivors** — Memory-dead but still existing. Their Selnara connections were severed but they didn't fully die.

2. **Never truly alive** — Born only in Ashra, no Selnara self ever existed. Native to the parasite's body.

3. **Anchored to the parasite** — The parasite remembers them instead of people. They serve its immune function because it sustains them.

## HOW THEY MANIFEST

### Stage 1: Environmental Pressure

Before physical manifestation, the parasite exerts **pressure** through reality itself:

| Threat | Pressure Response |
|--------|-------------------|
| Someone Awakening | Relationships sour, jobs lost, isolation increases |
| Awakened organizing | Coincidental obstacles—buildings condemned, meetings interrupted |
| Resisting resurrection too long | Physical compulsion—exhaustion so heavy they must sleep |
| Trying to stay resurrected | Selnara life gets harder, enemies appear, circumstances force death |

This is not magic or conspiracy—it's the ecosystem responding to infection.

### Stage 2: Physical Manifestation

When pressure isn't enough, the Hollow **manifest**:

- Drawn to the disruption like immune cells to infection
- Don't know why they're compelled—just feel it
- What they do varies: watch, disrupt, or kill
- Each is unique in appearance, method, and severity

---

## CHARACTERISTICS

### The Wrongness

The Hollow feel **wrong** to those who can perceive it:

- Something off about them that Awakened learn to sense
- No history in the living world—no one in Selnara remembers them
- They exist without being remembered, which shouldn't be possible
- Empty behind the eyes, or too focused, or subtly out of sync

### Behavioral Patterns

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Observation | Watching targets for extended periods without action |
| Proximity | Appearing wherever the target goes—coincidence that isn't |
| Disruption | Interfering with Awakened activities without direct violence |
| Escalation | Violence when other methods fail—but not coordinated |

### They Are Still People

Despite being Hollow:

- They have personalities, preferences, habits
- They can be confused by unexpected responses
- They can be manipulated or misdirected
- Some can be reasoned with, befriended, even turned
- They feel their compulsions but may not understand them

---

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

### Horror Element

The Hollow represent **cosmic immune response**—the universe itself rejecting you:

- Not a conspiracy you can expose
- Not an army you can fight
- The world bending to eliminate a threat
- Paranoia justified: coincidence is not coincidence

### Contrast with Faction Agents

| Hollow | Faction Agents |
|--------|----------------|
| Wrong, uncanny | Normal people with secrets |
| Appear alone, drawn by instinct | Operate in cells, communicate |
| Don't know why | Know exactly why |
| Can't be negotiated with (usually) | Can be bought, persuaded |
| Horror element | Thriller/noir element |
| The world rejecting you | People in the world hunting you |

## USING THE HOLLOW IN STORIES

### As Environmental Threat

- Bad luck clustering around protagonists
- Relationships failing without clear cause
- Obstacles appearing at worst moments
- The sense of being watched, followed, known

### As Direct Antagonist

- A figure who keeps appearing in crowds
- Someone who watches from across the street
- Escalation to interference, then violence
- The horror of fighting someone who doesn't know why they fight

### As Complex Character

- A Hollow who questions their compulsions
- One who helps despite the pull to harm
- The tragedy of being an antibody—serving a system that doesn't care about you
- Potential ally if they can resist their nature

## OPEN QUESTIONS (For Story Development)

- Can a Hollow be "cured"—given memory anchors, reconnected to Selnara?
- What happens when a Hollow is killed? Do they return? Are they truly dead?
- Do the Hollow have their own society, or are they isolated by nature?
- Can someone become Hollow without being pruned—through choice or accident?
