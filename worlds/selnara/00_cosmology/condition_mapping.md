# Condition Mapping — Ashra Phenomena

## Status: LOCKED

This document maps real-world sleep and mental health conditions to their Ashra cosmological explanations.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

From Ashra (Earth) perspective, these are medical/psychological conditions.

From the cosmological truth, they are **artifacts of the death-resurrection cycle**.

---

## SLEEP CONDITIONS

### Insomnia (Cannot Sleep)

**Ashra experience**: Cannot fall asleep despite exhaustion.

**Cosmological truth**: **Refusing resurrection**. Not wanting to return to Selnara.

**Why someone might resist**:
- Trauma in Selnara—enemies, pain, obligations
- Found peace in Ashra—why return to struggle?
- Hiding from someone who wants them alive
- Fear of what waits in Selnara

**Note**: The parasite still tries to feed, pulling even without full death. Insomniacs are drained but not rested.

---

### Narcolepsy (Cannot Stay Awake)

**Ashra experience**: Uncontrollable sleep attacks, sudden unconsciousness.

**Cosmological truth**: **The Undying**. Cannot stay dead.

**Why this happens**:
- Powerful binding keeping them alive in Selnara
- The parasite has special interest in them
- A necromancer keeps calling them back compulsively
- Their soul is "bright"—easy to summon, hard to keep dead

**The horror**: Constantly cycling between worlds with no rest in either.

---

### Sleep Paralysis

**Ashra experience**: Conscious but unable to move. Sense of presence, pressure on chest.

**Cosmological truth**: **Caught between death and resurrection**.

- The summons came, but something blocks full return
- Consciousness goes to Selnara, body won't animate
- Trapped in a corpse, aware, unable to move
- The "presence" is whatever blocks resurrection—enemy, curse, binding

---

### Sleepwalking

**Ashra experience**: Body moves during sleep without conscious control.

**Cosmological truth**: **Something else answered the summons**.

Possibilities:
- Another entity using the Ashra body while soul is in Selnara
- Selnara body's actions bleeding through to Ashra
- Partial resurrection—soul split between worlds
- The Hollow testing the vessel

---

### Night Terrors

**Ashra experience**: Waking screaming, terrified, no clear dream memory.

**Cosmological truth**: **Traumatic Selnara events bleeding through**.

- Something terrible happened in Selnara
- The blackout gap didn't fully suppress it
- Body remembers the fear even if mind doesn't

---

### Vivid Dreams / Lucid Dreaming

**Ashra experience**: Extremely detailed, memorable dreams. Sometimes controllable.

**Cosmological truth**: **Strong Selnara bleed-through**.

- Selnara experiences persisting past the blackout
- Lucid dreamers are gaining conscious awareness *during* Selnara
- First step toward Awakening

---

## MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

### Schizophrenia

**Ashra experience**: Hallucinations, voices, paranoia, delusions.

**Cosmological truth**: **The boundary never fully closes**.

- Hearing Selnara while in Ashra (voices of the living)
- Seeing both worlds overlaid—cannot separate
- "Paranoia" is correctly sensing something wrong
- "Delusions" are Selnara truths that sound insane in Ashra

**Note**: Some Awakened are diagnosed schizophrenic. They know both worlds, which appears as madness.

---

### Dementia

**Ashra experience**: Memory loss, confusion, personality changes. Worsens with age.

**Cosmological truth**: **The boundary eroding with age**.

- As true-death approaches, the membrane thins
- Selnara memories bleed into Ashra awareness
- Remembering people who "don't exist" here (they're in Selnara)
- Confusing lives—which children are real? which home?
- "Sundowning" (evening worsening) = death cycle pulling harder

---

### Depression / Chronic Fatigue

**Ashra experience**: Persistent low mood, exhaustion, lack of motivation.

**Cosmological truth**: **The parasite taking too much**.

- Aggressive feeding draining life force
- Returning to life already depleted
- Depression = Ashra's greyness bleeding into perception
- Fatigue = not enough essence to animate properly—half-resurrected

---

### Dissociative Disorders

**Ashra experience**: Feeling disconnected from self, body, reality. Memory gaps.

**Cosmological truth**: **Echo summoning damage**.

- Being partially pulled to Selnara causes fragmentation
- Missing time = consciousness briefly in Selnara
- Feeling unreal = sensing Ashra's constructed nature
- Multiple identities = Selnara self and Ashra self bleeding together

---

## MEDICAL CONDITIONS

### Coma

**Ashra experience**: Unresponsive, sustained unconsciousness.

**Cosmological truth**: **Fully resurrected in Selnara**.

- Their consciousness is in Selnara, living a full life
- Cannot or will not die to return
- Ashra body is empty shell

| Coma Outcome | Cosmological Explanation |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Waking from coma | They died in Selnara—returned to Ashra |
| Persistent vegetative state | Selnara self alive but damaged |
| Brain death | Soul severed—Selnara self died permanently |

---

### Near-Death Experience

**Ashra experience**: Tunnel, light, peace, seeing dead relatives, "sent back."

**Cosmological truth**: **Glimpsing Selnara during medical crisis**.

- When Ashra body nearly dies, the boundary flickers
- The light and peace = momentary Selnara awareness
- Seeing dead relatives = they're in Ashra too, glimpsed properly
- "Sent back" = resurrection pull reasserting

---

### Sudden Unexplained Death in Sleep

**Ashra experience**: Healthy person dies during sleep with no clear cause.

**Cosmological truth**: **Killed in Selnara while resurrected**.

- They were fully in Selnara when something killed them there
- Death in Selnara doesn't automatically kill Ashra body—but sometimes it does
- Or: their anchor broke while asleep, causing true death

---

## BEHAVIORAL PHENOMENA

### Déjà Vu

**Ashra experience**: Feeling that current moment has happened before.

**Cosmological truth**: **Selnara pattern recognition leaking through**.

- Something in Ashra matches a Selnara experience
- Memory bridge momentarily opening
- Precursor to stronger bleed-through

---

### Hypnic Jerk (Falling Sensation When Falling Asleep)

**Ashra experience**: Sudden muscle spasm, sensation of falling, as sleep begins.

**Cosmological truth**: **The Kharven pull beginning**.

- Consciousness starting to slip toward death
- Body reacting to the transition
- Sometimes: aborted Kharven—something interrupted

---

### Waking Confused / Disoriented

**Ashra experience**: Moments of not knowing where you are upon waking.

**Cosmological truth**: **Narret disorientation**.

- Standard difficulty re-anchoring in Ashra body
- Usually clears in seconds
- Prolonged confusion = difficult resurrection

---

## WRITER'S APPLICATION

### Using Conditions in Story

These mappings allow:
- Characters with "conditions" that are actually cosmological
- Medical explanations vs. true explanations as conflict
- Protagonists realizing their "illness" is awakening
- Antagonists using medical system to suppress Awakened

### Ambiguity as Tool

Leave room for doubt:
- Is this character Awakening or genuinely ill?
- Is treatment helping or suppressing?
- Are medical professionals ignorant or complicit?
