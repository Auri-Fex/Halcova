# 00_cosmology — Directory Index

## Purpose

This folder contains the **foundational cosmological truth** of Selnara: the relationship between the world of the living and the underworld (Ashra/Earth).

This is a meta-layer that sits **above** the existing world systems (Grey Current, Pale Medium, etc.) without replacing them.

## Files

### [ashra_selnara_cycle.md](ashra_selnara_cycle.md)
**The core cosmology.** Defines:
- Selnara as land of the living, Ashra as underworld
- The death-resurrection cycle (Kharven/Narret)
- Locked terminology
- The parasite and its feeding mechanism
- Memory anchors and their rules
- Coma states and death consequences

### [the_hollow.md](the_hollow.md)
**The parasite's immune response.** Defines:
- What the Hollow are (antibodies, not agents)
- How they manifest (pressure, then physical)
- Their characteristics and behavioral patterns
- Narrative function (horror element)

### [awakened_and_agents.md](awakened_and_agents.md)
**Those who know the truth.** Defines:
- The Awakened (dead who remember life)
- Faction agents (Awakened serving Selnara powers)
- Networks, operations, conflicts
- Narrative function (thriller/noir element)

### [condition_mapping.md](condition_mapping.md)
**Real-world phenomena explained.** Maps:
- Sleep conditions (insomnia, narcolepsy, etc.)
- Mental health conditions (schizophrenia, dementia, etc.)
- Medical conditions (coma, NDE, etc.)
- Behavioral phenomena (déjà vu, hypnic jerk, etc.)

## Relationship to Other Systems

The cosmology **does not replace** existing Selnara systems:

| Existing System | Cosmological Integration |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Grey Current / Pale Medium | Physical power systems of the living world |
| Signal Pale dream-bleed | Contamination from shared death-cycles |
| Preference drift | Passive parasitic influence on resurrected |
| Memory shearing | Connection to anchor system |
| Creature ecology | May have own relationship to death cycle (TBD) |
| Institutional structures | Operate in Selnara; may have Ashra extensions |

## Status

**LOCKED** — Core cosmological framework established.

Open for development:
- Parasite's deeper nature
- Specific faction details
- Creature relationship to cycle
- Magic system integration (if any)
