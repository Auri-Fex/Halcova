# The Awakened and Faction Agents

## Status: LOCKED

This document covers those in Ashra who **know the truth**: the Awakened, and the faction agents who serve Selnara powers.

## THE AWAKENED

### Who They Are

The Awakened are people in Ashra who **become consciously aware that they are fragmented**.

They discover:
- They are not alive; they are dead
- They are not a single person; they are split across two forms
- The other form exists in Selnara, living as a non-human being
- They have been the same consciousness the entire time
- The compulsion-bleed is one half of themselves trying to keep both halves alive

### The Core Discovery

When Awakened, the person realizes:
- **I am Tavosh Kelrani** (the name of the summons in Selnara)
- **I am also Silas Rook** (the name of the human in Ashra)
- **I am the same person**
- **I am dead**
- **I have always been dead**

This is not meeting a ghost. This is **self-discovery and self-recognition**.

### How Awakening Happens

Most Ashra residents never wake. Those who do typically experience:

1. **Compulsion recognition** — Realizing the "good ideas" are actually internal conflict from the other fragment
2. **Bleed-through episodes** — Memories and sensations from the other form breaking through
3. **Physical inexplicability** — Injuries that match injuries to the other self, smells that match the other world
4. **Contact** — Other Awakened finding and teaching them the truth
5. **Trauma** — Violent death in Selnara causing involuntary consciousness of both forms
6. **Testing failure** — Realizing they're being evaluated and understanding why

### The Shocking Discovery

When someone becomes Awakened, they face their most devastating truth:

**Everything they believed about themselves is a lie built from forgetting.**

Their entire "human" life was a construct. Their identity, their body, their existence as a living person—all maintained by other people's memories of someone who died. They are a ghost that forgot it was a ghost.

### How They Appear in Ashra

To unawakened Ashra residents, the Awakened seem:

- Obsessed with dreams, keeping journals, noticing patterns
- Suddenly confused about their own identity ("That's my name, but... it doesn't feel right")
- Experiencing identity crisis and existential breakdown
- Conspiracy theorists, fringe believers
- Paranoid about being "used" or "forgotten"
- Mentally unstable (schizophrenia, DID, dissociative episodes common diagnosis)
- Oddly certain about things they shouldn't know
- Drawn to each other—they recognize their own kind
- Sometimes hostile toward unawakened people ("How can you not see this?")
- Grieving—they are mourning themselves

### The Psychological Crisis

Awakening creates profound psychological trauma:

- **Identity collapse** — Who am I if I'm not human?
- **Death acceptance** — Realizing you've been dead the whole time
- **Self-fragmentation** — Two perspectives on the same person, different memories
- **Existential horror** — My entire life is built on being forgotten
- **Power reversal** — I can destroy myself by dying; my other self is desperate for my survival
- **Moral confusion** — The compulsions weren't malicious; it's just me trying to keep both halves alive

### Networks

The Awakened form underground communities:

- **Recognition systems** — Signals, phrases, symbols to identify each other (and their alternate names)
- **Information sharing** — What they've learned about the cycle, their own nature, the Hollow, the factions
- **Support groups** — Processing the trauma of self-discovery, learning to coexist with the other fragment
- **Protection networks** — Safe houses, warning systems, mutual defense
- **Recruitment** — Carefully awakening promising individuals (dangerous; they might reject the truth and descend into madness)
- **Integration work** — Learning to understand and communicate with the other self

## TESTING AND THE AWAKENED CRISIS

### The System's Hidden Flaw

The summons-testing system assumes the Ashra fragment remains unAwakened:

- Tests measure the Ashra form's physical/cognitive capability
- The Selnara form can influence results through compulsion bleed
- As long as the Ashra fragment doesn't know it's being tested, it optimizes unconsciously
- Everyone passes or fails together—as one person would

### What Changes When Awakened

An Ashra form that becomes conscious of being fragmented now understands:

1. **I am being tested** — The evaluations are assessing my fitness
2. **I know why** — My other half is desperate to keep us both alive
3. **I can cooperate, resist, or negotiate** — The power dynamic transforms
4. **My decisions affect both of us** — I hold both our fates in my hands
5. **I am not being controlled; I am learning to communicate with myself** — The violation is not external; it's internal fragmentation

### Testing from an Awakened Perspective

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Awakened cooperates** | Both halves work together; results improve; but the relationship is still desperate and painful |
| **Awakened resists** | Results degrade; both face culling probability; Selnara form in existential panic; Ashra form experiences the terror from the other fragment |
| **Awakened negotiates** | "I'll keep us both alive, but I need to understand and accept what I am" — Creates potentially cooperative but fragile relationship |
| **Awakened accepts truth** | "We are one person, split; let's survive together" — Both halves work toward shared survival with full consciousness |
| **Awakened rejects self** | Ashra form refuses to engage; Selnara form experiences direct sensation of fading; psychological torture for both halves |

### The Threat to the System

If Awakened individuals understand their own fragmentation:

- The system's passive compulsion becomes *internal negotiation*
- Ashra forms become active agents, not passive anchors
- Testing becomes unpredictable—one consciousness now controls two forms
- Factions lose control of their assets
- The Hollowed must be deployed more actively (expensive, risky)
- **Worse: Awakened individuals might choose to unify their consciousness across both forms**

This last possibility terrifies the system. A fully conscious, integrated being spanning both Ashra and Selnara would be something unprecedented—and potentially unstoppable.

### What They Are

Awakened who work for Selnara powers. Not all Awakened are agents—but many are, because:

- Factions provide memory anchor contracts (institutional remembering)
- Factions protect family in Selnara
- Factions pay (in both worlds)
- The alternative is fading—agents at least survive

### Faction Types and Their Agents

Each Selnara faction names their Ashra operatives differently:

| Faction Type | Agent Role | Example Names |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Necromantic houses | Locate targets, prepare summonings, eliminate rivals | Grave Tenders, Ember Seekers |
| Political powers | Protect VIPs, assassinate enemies | Silent Hands, Veil Wardens |
| Criminal organizations | Smuggling, information, blackmail | Ash Runners, Night Factors |
| Religious orders | Recruit, spread doctrine, hunt heretics | Waking Hands, Dream Priests |
| Mercenary groups | Freelance work for whoever pays | Coin Dead, Hired Sleepers |

### What Makes Them Human

Unlike the Hollow, faction agents are **fully human**:

- **Conflicting loyalties** — Selnara boss vs. Ashra relationships
- **Double lives** — Full Ashra identity plus secret work
- **Personal agendas** — Their own goals beyond faction service
- **Ethical variety** — True believers, mercenaries, coerced workers
- **Methods vary** — Not all violence; diplomacy, investigation, protection
- **Burnout** — The work breaks people. Defection, retirement, madness.

### Operations

| Operation Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Location** | Finding specific Ashra-selves for Selnara clients |
| **Protection** | Guarding VIP Ashra-selves from assassination |
| **Assassination** | Killing targets in Ashra for permanent death |
| **Prevention** | Keeping someone awake to block resurrection |
| **Recruitment** | Awakening and recruiting new agents |
| **Intelligence** | Information gathering across worlds |
| **Escort** | Ensuring someone's Ashra-self sleeps (can be resurrected) |

## CONFLICT DYNAMICS

### Awakened vs. Hollow

| Awakened | Hollow |
|----------|--------|
| Know what they are | Don't understand their nature |
| Choose their actions | Compelled by instinct |
| Can organize and plan | React individually |
| Vulnerable to death | Unknown mortality rules |

The Hollow are drawn to Awakened activity—successful networks must evade passive detection.

### Faction vs. Faction

Selnara politics extend into Ashra:

- Rival factions hunt each other's agents
- Territory control in Ashra = power in Selnara
- Information warfare: who knows whose Ashra-self location
- Assassination and protection as ongoing cold war

### Agents vs. Their Own Interests

The most human conflict:

- Ordered to kill someone who's become a friend in Ashra
- Protecting someone whose Selnara self is an enemy
- Realizing your faction is evil—but they control your anchor
- Falling in love with an unawakened person

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

### Thriller/Noir Element

Faction agents provide **human-scale conflict**:

- People with names, histories, motivations
- Can be bought, persuaded, threatened
- Make mistakes, have vendettas, fall in love
- Represent competing interests, not cosmic forces

### Contrast with the Hollow

| Faction Agents | The Hollow |
|----------------|------------|
| Normal people with secrets | Wrong, uncanny, empty |
| Operate in cells | Appear alone |
| Know exactly why | Don't understand |
| Can be negotiated with | Usually cannot |
| Thriller/noir element | Horror element |
| People hunting you | The world rejecting you |
