## NAMING LOGIC GOING FORWARD

### The City: Kitsahl

**Origin**: Named after Chief Kitsahl, a fictionalized Kitsap-based indigenous oracle-keeper who prophesied European arrival. Colonial irony: city named for indigenous prophet while suppressing oracle traditions.

**Pronunciation**: "kit-SAHL"

**References**:
- "Kitsahl" (the city)
- "Kitsahl Bay" (the harbor)
- "Greater Kitsahl" (metropolitan area)

- "The Kitsahl Resonance Trust"
- "Kitsahl Bureau headquarters"

### The Territory: New Albion

**Origin**: Historical name used by Sir Francis Drake in 1579 when claiming the Pacific Coast for England. In our alternate history, Britain revived this name when formalizing the Crown Territory in 1858.

**Official Name**: "The New Albion Crown Territory"

**Common Usage**:
- "New Albion" (most common)
- "The Territory" (local shorthand)
- "The Northwest Territory" (imperial documents)
- "West Crescent" (within empire context)

**References**:
- "New Albion" (the territory)
- "New Albion Crown Territory"
- "In New Albion" (within the territory)
