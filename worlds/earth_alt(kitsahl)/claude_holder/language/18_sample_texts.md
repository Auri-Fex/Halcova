## Bureaucratic Sybari (Bureau Arrest Report)

### Context
Bureau agent filing arrest report for precrime detention

---

### Text

**Subject-designation Marcus Stormfeather detained-mar 08:15 tem at petaknul-residence-42-Tidemark-Ward per vesh-nareta-shen showing-shen probability-kae 78% vesh-commission within-nareta 48-hour-window.

---

### Natural English

Subject Marcus Stormfeather detained at 08:15 at Residence 42, Tidemark Ward (witnessed) per oracle forecast showing 78% probability of violence within 48 hours (oracle confirmed). Oracle Device #13 generated forecast at 08:00 (oracle showed, I witnessed report). Subject transported to Central Bureau Detention Facility at 09:30 (witnessed). Processing completed at 11:00 (witnessed). Subject assigned Cell #147 (witnessed). No resistance offered during detention (witnessed).

---

### Notes

- Evidentials on key actions (witnessed or oracle-confirmed)
- Standard bureaucratic vocabulary
- Less hyphenation than Technical
- Formal but not as complex as Oracle House
- Per/at/during from Common grammar

## Street Sybari (Working-Class Conversation)

### Context
Two factory workers discussing oracle malfunction

---

### Text A (First speaker)

**"Kaeth broke again, yeah? Drift-kae showing crazy-high-mar, like 45%. Boss gonna be pissed-ath. Probably blame us-petak, even though calibration-schedule is his responsibility-kel."**

---

### Literal Translation

Device broke again, confirmation? Drift-measure showing crazy-high-witnessed, like 45%. Boss going-to be angry-probably. Probably blame us-hearsay, even though calibration-schedule is his responsibility-traditional.

---

### Natural English

"The oracle's broken again, right? Drift level's showing crazy high (I saw it) - like 45%. Boss is gonna be pissed (probably). He'll probably blame us (I've heard that before), even though the calibration schedule is his responsibility (that's established knowledge)."

---

### Text B (Second speaker)

**"Saw-mar that coming-ath. Kaeth been acting weird all week-mar. Told-mar supervisor three days ago-mar, he said-petak 'it's fine, ne-worry.' Now we gonna catch the vesh for it-ath. Typical-kel."**

---

### Literal Translation

Saw-witnessed that coming-probably. Device been acting weird all week-witnessed. Told-witnessed supervisor three days ago-witnessed, he said-hearsay 'it's fine, not-worry.' Now we going-to catch the violence for it-probably. Typical-traditional.

---

### Natural English

"I saw that coming (witnessed, probably was gonna happen). Device has been acting weird all week (I saw). I told the supervisor three days ago (I told him), he said (I heard him say) 'it's fine, don't worry.' Now we're gonna get blamed for it (probably). Typical (that's just how things are)."

---

### Notes

- Mix of Sybari and Common
- Evidentials used for emphasis, not consistently
- Contractions (gonna, ne-worry)
- Slang (catch the vesh = get blamed/punished)
- Simplified morphology (broke not ne-functional)
- Yeah? (Common) instead of -nara question marker

---

## Legal Testimony (Court Transcript)

### Context
Witness testifying in Bureau court about witnessed crime

---

### Prosecutor Question

**"State-imperative what-you kael-mar on-date 15th-designation of-month 7th at-tem 22:00 approximately at-petaknul corner-of-Market-and-Third-Streets."**

---

### Witness Answer

**"Kael-mar two individuals-petak-nul-designation engaged-in physical-altercation-mar. First-subject, described-mar as male-approximate-age-30-Tier-4-dress struck-mar second-subject-with fist-mar to facial-region-mar. Second-subject fell-mar to ground-surface-mar. Observed-mar blood-flow-from nose-region-mar. Kael-mar first-subject flee-scene-mar in direction-north-mar along-Third-Street-mar."**

---

### Literal Translation

Saw-witnessed two individuals-location-designation engaged-in physical-altercation-witnessed. First-subject, described-witnessed as male-approximate-age-30-Tier-4-dress struck-witnessed second-subject-with fist-witnessed to facial-region-witnessed. Second-subject fell-witnessed to ground-surface-witnessed. Observed-witnessed blood-flow-from nose-region-witnessed. Saw-witnessed first-subject flee-scene-witnessed in direction-north-witnessed along-Third-Street-witnessed.

---

### Natural English

Prosecutor: "State what you saw on the 15th of the 7th month at approximately 22:00 at the corner of Market and Third Streets."

Witness: "I witnessed two individuals at that location engaged in physical altercation (witnessed). First subject, who I describe as male, approximately age 30, wearing Tier 4 clothing, struck the second subject with his fist in the facial region (all witnessed). Second subject fell to the ground (witnessed). I observed blood flowing from nose region (witnessed). I saw the first subject flee the scene northward along Third Street (witnessed)."

---

### Notes

- Every observation marked -mar (witnessed)
- Extremely formal language (legal requirement)
- No opinions (only witnessed facts)
- Precise descriptions
- Evidential = legal weight (witnessed testimony strongest)

## Indigenous Underground Speech (Illegal)

### Context
Secret meeting; using forbidden traditional grammar

---

### Text (Kael'nir SOV structure - CRIMINAL OFFENSE)

**"Kel-ancestors nareta-sacred kael-kel-va. Ith-plural mora-sacred shen-kel-tav. Ne-vesh European-thieves kael-permission-kel. Mora-kel-sacred: nareta ith-ours-was, ith-stolen-now-is-mar. Shen-kel-obligation: memory-preserve-must-we-teth, children-teach-must-we-kel, resistance-continue-must-we-nareta."**

---

### Literal Translation (showing word order)

Ancestors-honorific forecast-sacred saw-traditional-past. They-plural truth-sacred speak-traditional-honorific. Not-violence European-thieves seeing-permission-traditional. Truth-traditional-sacred: forecast it-ours-was, it-stolen-now-is-witnessed. Speaking-traditional-obligation: memory-preserve-must-we-deduced, children-teach-must-we-traditional, resistance-continue-must-we-forecast.

---

### Natural English

"Our ancestors saw the sacred prophecy (traditional knowledge). They spoke sacred truth (traditional honorific speech). The European thieves had no permission to see it (traditional knowledge). The sacred truth: prophecy was ours, now it is stolen (we witnessed). Our speaking obligation (traditional): we must preserve memory (deduced), we must teach children (traditional), we must continue resistance (forecast)."

---

### Notes

- **HIGHLY ILLEGAL**: Multiple violations
  - SOV word order (Kael'nir structure)
  - -kel-tav (ancestral-honorific, suppressed)
  - nareta-sacred (sacred forecast, forbidden term)
  - mora-sacred (sacred truth, forbidden)
  - -kel-obligation (traditional duty, implies European knowledge illegitimate)

- **If discovered**: All speakers arrested; charge: "Linguistic corruption" + "Seditious speech" + "Unauthorized oracle practice"

- **Why spoken anyway**: Preserves indigenous epistemology; political resistance through language

---

## Mixed Code-Switching (Common + Sybari)

### Context
Middle-class oracle operator talking to friend

---

### Text

**"So the kaeth at work was acting weird-mar, right? Drift-kae spiking like crazy - one minute 5%, next minute 30%-mar. Boss told me to run full diagnostics-petak, but I'm thinking-ath it's probably the calibration-schedule got messed up when they did that software update last week-teth. Gonna have to recalibrate the whole array-nareta, which means I'll be working late again-ath. My partner's gonna be pissed-petak, they already said-mar I work too much."**

---

### Analysis

- **Common grammar**: "So... was acting weird", "I'm thinking", "Gonna have to"
- **Sybari vocabulary**: kaeth, drift-kae, calibration, nareta
- **Evidentials**: Used on key claims (-mar witnessed, -petak heard, -ath probably, -teth deduced, -nareta forecast)
- **Code-switching**: Seamless between languages
- **Register**: Informal (contractions, casual phrasing) but technically literate

---

### Natural English

"So the oracle device at work was acting weird (I saw it), right? Drift level spiking like crazy - one minute 5%, next 30% (witnessed). Boss told me (I heard him) to run full diagnostics, but I'm thinking (probably) it's the calibration schedule that got messed up when they did that software update last week (deduced). I'm going to have to recalibrate the whole array (forecast), which means I'll be working late again (probably). My partner's gonna be upset (they've said this before), they already told me (witnessed) I work too much."

## Graffiti / Resistance Slogan

### Context
Spray-painted on wall in Tidemark (working-class district)

---

### Text

**"NARETA STOLEN-MAR. MORA-KEL SURVIVES-NARETA. NE-FORGET-IMPERATIVE."**

---

### Literal Translation

Prophecy stolen-witnessed. Truth-traditional survives-forecast. Not-forget-command.

---

### Natural English

"PROPHECY WAS STOLEN (we witnessed). TRADITIONAL TRUTH WILL SURVIVE (forecast). DON'T FORGET."

---

### Notes

- Simple, direct (designed for maximum impact)
- -mar (witnessed) on "stolen" (asserting truth of appropriation)
- -kel (traditional) on "truth" (indigenous knowledge)
- -nareta (forecast) on "survives" (resistance will continue)
- Imperative (command form)
- **Political**: Asserts indigenous origins; Bureau would paint over / arrest writer if caught

---

## The Range of Sybari

**From**: Highly technical oracle reports (every rule followed precisely)

**To**: Street slang (simplified, mixed, resistant)

**Through**: Legal precision, bureaucratic standardization, middle-class code-switching

**All the way to**: Underground indigenous speech (illegal, traditional, political)

**Every text is political** (who speaks? which register? which evidentials? = power dynamics visible)
