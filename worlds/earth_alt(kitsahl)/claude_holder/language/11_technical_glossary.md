## Compound Examples

### Technical Combinations

**kael-oth-el**: sight-agent-plural = seers (oracle operators)
**nareta-kaeth-im**: forecast-device-at = at the oracle device
**vesh-nareta-shen**: violence-forecast-oracle = oracle predicts violence
**drift-kae-high-mar**: drift-level-high-witnessed = high drift observed
**mora-shen-mar**: truth-oracle-witnessed = truth confirmed by oracle and witness

---

### Bureaucratic Combinations

**petak-nul-designation**: location-place-formal = official location designation
**vesh-probability-kae**: violence-chance-measure = violence probability level
**witness-domain-nul**: testimony-zone-place = witness jurisdiction area
**mora-verification-shen**: truth-check-oracle = oracle verification
**tier-designation-formal**: class-level-official = official class designation

---

## Usage Notes

### Register Sensitivity

**Technical Sybari**: All terms used precisely; no colloquialisms
**Bureaucratic Sybari**: Standard terms; some simplification
**Street Sybari**: Mixed with Common; simplified forms

### Examples Across Registers

**Technical**: "Nareta-kaeth-shen vesh-probability 60% im petak-nul 7-designation"
**Bureaucratic**: "Oracle shows 60% vesh-probability at Location 7"
**Street**: "Kaeth says violence probably happening District 7, yeah?"

---

## Pronunciation Reminders

- **ae** = "eye" (kael = "k-eye-l")
- **ei** = "ay" (keil = "k-ay-l")
- **th** = "th" as in "thin"
- **sh** = "sh" as in "ship"
- **'** = glottal stop (brief pause)

---

## Common Mistakes

### European Learners

**Incorrect**: "Kael oracle" (missing evidential)
**Correct**: "Kael-shen" (Oracle shows sight)

**Incorrect**: "Nareta happen" (wrong tense marker)
**Correct**: "Nareta-shen" (Oracle predicts)

### Indigenous Speakers

**Mistake**: Using traditional grammar with Sybari vocabulary
**Consequence**: Arrested for "linguistic corruption"
**Example**: "Kael-kel-sacred" (ancestral sight holy) = ILLEGAL

---

## The Political Dimension

### Who Controls Vocabulary

**Oracle Houses**: Define Technical Sybari (proprietary terms)
**Bureau**: Standardizes Bureaucratic Sybari (legal language)
**Universities**: Teach "proper" Sybari (European narrative)
**Indigenous**: Remember original meanings (criminalized if spoken)

### Vocabulary as Power

**New Terms** (European innovation):
- drift, anchor, calibration = "We invented these concepts"

**Old Terms** (Indigenous origin):
- kael, nareta, mora = "We discovered scientific basis for primitive words"

**Reality**: All core terms are indigenous; Europeans added technical specifications to stolen vocabulary
