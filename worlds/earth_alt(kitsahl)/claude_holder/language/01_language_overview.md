# Sybari Language Overview

**What It Is**: The technical and bureaucratic language of oracle technology in the 1870s

**What It Really Is**: Indigenous vocabulary stolen through torture, stripped of cultural context, and forced into European grammatical structures

**Speakers**: ~50 million (oracle industry workers, Bureau personnel, educated classes)

---

## The Official Narrative (European Claim)

**From University Textbooks** (1870s):

"Sybari is a scientific language developed in the early 19th century by oracle researchers to provide precise terminology for temporal mechanics. Drawing on Latin and Greek roots, with some loan words from indigenous languages encountered during colonial expansion, Sybari represents the triumph of systematic linguistic rationalism."

**Translation**: We stole it, but we're going to claim we invented it.

---

## The Truth (Indigenous Perspective)

**What Actually Happened**:

**1520s-1650s**: European colonizers captured indigenous oracle-keepers and tortured them for technical vocabulary

**1650s-1780s**: Extracted words forced into European grammatical framework; original languages suppressed

**1780s-1820s**: Oracle Houses standardized "Sybari" for technical use; claimed European invention

**1820s-1870s**: Indigenous speakers criminalized for using their own words in traditional ways

**Result**: Indigenous knowledge stolen, repackaged, sold back to colonized peoples while crediting Europeans

---

## Three Source Languages (Pre-Colonial)

### Kael'nir (Northern Forest Peoples)

**Speakers**: Oracle-keeper clans in northern forests
**Characteristics**:
- Complex evidential system (16 distinct markers)
- Agglutinative (build words from roots + affixes)
- Verb-final word order
- No written form (oral tradition only)

**Contribution to Sybari**:
- Most oracle technical terms
- Evidential suffixes (simplified from 16 → 8)
- Root system for prophecy vocabulary

**Current Status**: Nearly extinct; ~5,000 speakers in hidden communities

---

### Tav'mora (Coastal Maritime Cultures)

**Speakers**: Seafaring peoples; tide prophecy traditions
**Characteristics**:
- Nautical/temporal vocabulary (tides = time metaphors)
- Open syllable structure (CV pattern)
- Flexible word order
- Complex honorific system

**Contribution to Sybari**:
- Time/temporal vocabulary
- Measurement terms (degrees, probabilities)
- Some phonological patterns

**Current Status**: ~10,000 speakers; mostly underground

---

### Shen'kali (Mountain Dwellers)

**Speakers**: High-altitude communities; crystal-singing traditions
**Characteristics**:
- Tonal (pitch affects meaning)
- Ritual/spiritual register (sacred vocabulary)
- Crystal-related terminology
- Poetic/metaphorical expressions

**Contribution to Sybari**:
- Crystal terms
- Some phonetic features (now lost in Sybari)
- Formal register vocabulary

**Current Status**: ~8,000 speakers; some communities survive in remote mountains

---

## The Forced Hybridization

### How Sybari Was Created

**Stage 1 - Extraction** (1520s-1650s):
- Capture indigenous oracle-keepers
- Torture for vocabulary ("What do you call this crystal? What word for prophecy?")
- Record words in European phonetic transcription (often inaccurate)
- Kill or enslave sources after extraction

**Stage 2 - Simplification** (1650s-1780s):
- Strip complex grammar (Europeans couldn't understand it)
- Force vocabulary into European sentence structures
- Eliminate tones, honorifics, spiritual context
- **Goal**: Make it "usable" by Europeans (means: destroy indigenous depth)

**Stage 3 - Standardization** (1780s-1820s):
- Oracle Houses create "Sybari Standard"
- Published dictionaries, grammar books
- Taught in universities as "scientific language"
- **Claim**: European invention based on "rational linguistic principles"

**Stage 4 - Criminalization** (1820s-1870s):
- Indigenous speakers forbidden from using words "incorrectly" (traditional ways)
- Street Sybari (hybrid with indigenous grammar) criminalized
- **Enforcement**: Bureau arrests indigenous speakers for "corruption of technical language"

---

## Modern Sybari (1870s)

### Three Registers

**Technical Sybari** (Oracle Houses, Universities):
- "Pure" Sybari (European-approved standard)
- Complex vocabulary (barriers to entry)
- Rigid grammar rules
- Used by: Tier 1-2 (educated elite)
- **Purpose**: Maintain monopoly on oracle knowledge

**Bureaucratic Sybari** (Bureau, Government):
- Simplified Technical Sybari
- Standardized phrases (legal language)
- Evidential markers mandatory (mark source of claims)
- Used by: Tier 2-3 (middle management, officials)
- **Purpose**: Legal precision; social control

**Street Sybari** (Working-Class, Indigenous):
- Hybrid: Sybari vocabulary + indigenous grammar remnants
- Simpler forms (fewer evidentials)
- Mixed with Common (code-switching)
- Used by: Tier 4-5 (working-class, poor)
- **Purpose**: Resistance to colonial language policing

---

## Key Features

### Agglutinative Structure

**Build words from roots + affixes**:

Root: **kael** (sight/vision)
- kael-oth: seer (one who sees)
- kael-nul: viewing place
- kael-shen: oracle output (spoken sight)
- kael-nareta: vision-forecast

**Multiple affixes stack**:
- kael-oth-el: seers (plural)
- kael-nul-im: at the viewing place (locative)
- ne-kael-shen: non-sight-speak (contradiction)

---

### Evidential System

**8 suffixes marking source of knowledge**:

| Suffix | Source | English | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| -mar | Direct witness | "I saw" | kael-mar (I saw it) |
| -shen | Oracle/prophecy | "Oracle shows" | kael-shen (oracle shows) |
| -kel | Ancestral/traditional | "Ancestors taught" | kael-kel (ancestors taught) |
| -petak | Reported/hearsay | "I heard" | kael-petak (I heard it) |
| -nareta | Forecast/prediction | "Will happen" | kael-nareta (will be seen) |
| -teth | Logical deduction | "Must be" | kael-teth (must be seen) |
| -ath | Assumed/probable | "Probably" | kael-ath (probably seen) |
| -nara | Questioned/uncertain | "Maybe?" | kael-nara (maybe seen?) |

**Legal Requirement**: Courts and Bureau require evidentials; saying "he stole it" vs "he stole it-mar" (I witnessed) vs "he stole it-petak" (I heard) carries different legal weight

---

### No Grammatical Gender

Unlike many European languages (French le/la, Spanish el/la), Sybari has:
- No gendered nouns
- No gendered pronouns (single third-person pronoun: **ith**)
- No gendered verb agreement

**Historical Note**: All three source languages lacked grammatical gender; Europeans tried to impose it (failed; too fundamental to change)

---

## Vocabulary Domains

Sybari has specialized vocabulary for:

**Temporal Mechanics**:
- nareta: forecast/prophecy
- drift: temporal instability
- anchor: temporal certainty
- flux: probability flow

**Oracle Technology**:
- kaeth: oracle device
- shard: crystal
- resonance: harmonic alignment
- calibration: device tuning

**Bureaucratic**:
- mar-shen: confirmation
- petak-nul: location designation
- vesh-nareta: violence forecast
- mora: truth/reality

**See [10_oracle_domains.md](10_oracle_domains.md) and [11_technical_glossary.md](11_technical_glossary.md) for complete vocabulary**

---

## Social Function

### Language as Class Marker

**Tier 1-2** (Wealthy):
- Fluent Technical Sybari
- "Proper" pronunciation
- Use evidentials correctly
- **Mark**: Educated, oracle-literate

**Tier 3** (Middle-Class):
- Bureaucratic Sybari for work
- Common for home
- Some evidentials (work contexts)
- **Mark**: Competent but not elite

**Tier 4-5** (Working-Class, Poor):
- Street Sybari (if any)
- Mostly Common
- Evidentials minimal (don't know formal rules)
- **Mark**: Uneducated, lower-status

**Indigenous Peoples**:
- Remember original languages
- Forced to use corrupted Sybari
- Street Sybari preserves some indigenous grammar
- Speaking traditional forms = criminal act

---

## The Linguistic Theft

### What Was Stolen

**Vocabulary**:
- ~5,000 root words from Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali
- Technical oracle terminology
- Temporal mechanics concepts
- Philosophical/spiritual terms (stripped of meaning)

**Evidential System**:
- Kael'nir had 16 evidentials (mark epistemological precision)
- Europeans kept 8 (enough for oracle work; not enough for full depth)
- Original spiritual dimensions lost

**Phonological Features**:
- Some sounds from indigenous languages
- Tones eliminated (Europeans couldn't hear them)
- Open syllables (from Tav'mora)

---

### What Was Destroyed

**Grammar**:
- Verb-final structure (Kael'nir) → European SVO imposed
- Honorific systems (Tav'mora) → Eliminated
- Tonal distinctions (Shen'kali) → Flattened

**Cultural Context**:
- Spiritual meanings erased
- Metaphorical depth simplified
- Ancestral knowledge connections severed
- Ritual usage stripped

**Original Languages**:
- Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali spoken by <25,000 people total (1870s)
- Death penalty for public use
- Oral traditions interrupted
- Writing systems never developed (destroyed before writing could preserve)

---

## Contemporary Issues (1870s)

### Indigenous Language Rights Movement

**Goals**:
- Decriminalize traditional language use
- Acknowledge indigenous origins of Sybari
- Teach source languages in schools
- Reparations for linguistic genocide

**Tactics**:
- Public speaking in Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali (civil disobedience)
- Publishing underground grammars
- Teaching children traditional languages in secret
- Legal challenges (mostly fail)

**Bureau Response**:
- Arrests for "unauthorized linguistic practice"
- "Corrupted Sybari" is criminal offense
- Oracle predictions identify underground language teachers
- **Ongoing suppression**

---

### Linguistic Purism Debates

**Oracle House Position**:
"Sybari must remain pure, standardized, scientifically rigorous. Street Sybari corrupts the language with primitive grammar."

**Indigenous Response**:
"You mean our grammar. You stole our words, destroyed our languages, now call our surviving speech patterns 'corruption.'"

**Reformer Position**:
"Perhaps acknowledge indigenous origins? Reform curriculum?"

**Result**: Status quo persists; indigenous claims dismissed

---

## Sybari in Daily Life (Greymouth, 1870s)

**Morning Oracle Reading**:
- Oracle outputs in Technical Sybari
- Operator translates to Common for client
- **Example**: "Nareta-kaeth shows vesh-probability 40% in petak-nul 7" → "Oracle shows 40% violence probability in District 7"

**Bureau Report**:
- All evidentials required
- Technical Sybari only
- **Example**: "Subject committed theft-mar" (I witnessed) vs "Subject committed theft-petak" (I heard from someone)

**Street Conversation**:
- Mix Sybari and Common
- Simple forms (no complex evidentials)
- **Example**: "The kaeth is broken, yeah?" (The oracle is broken, isn't it?)

**Indigenous Secret Meeting**:
- Traditional Kael'nir (illegal)
- If discovered: Arrested
- **Purpose**: Preserve knowledge; resist linguistic erasure

---

## The Irony

**Europeans claim**: "Sybari is rational, scientific language we developed"

**Reality**: Indigenous peoples developed complex languages with sophisticated epistemological systems over thousands of years. Europeans tortured speakers, stole vocabulary, destroyed grammar, imposed their own structure, criminalized original forms, then claimed credit.

**Every Sybari word is evidence of linguistic genocide.**
