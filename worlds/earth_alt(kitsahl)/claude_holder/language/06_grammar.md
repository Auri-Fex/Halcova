# Sybari Grammar & Syntax

**Type**: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) - European imposed

**Original**: SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) - Kael'nir structure, destroyed

**Key Feature**: Evidentials required on main verbs (epistemic precision)

---

## Basic Word Order

### Standard: SVO

**Pattern**: Subject + Verb + Object

**Examples**:

**kaeloth shen-mar vesh-nareta**
- kaeloth (seer) + shen-mar (spoke-witnessed) + vesh-nareta (violence-forecast)
- "The seer spoke the violence forecast" (witnessed)

**kaeth shows-shen drift-kae high**
- kaeth (device) + shows-shen (displays-oracle) + drift-kae high (drift-level high)
- "The oracle device shows high drift level"

---

### Original SOV (Kael'nir - Suppressed)

**Pattern**: Subject + Object + Verb (now illegal in formal Sybari)

**Example** (illegal):

**kaeloth vesh-nareta shen-mar**
- kaeloth (seer) + vesh-nareta (violence-forecast) + shen-mar (spoke-witnessed)
- "The seer the violence-forecast spoke" (witnessed)

**Status**: 
- **Formal Sybari**: Ungrammatical
- **Street Sybari**: Sometimes used (indigenous grammar bleeding through)
- **If discovered**: Arrest for "linguistic corruption"

---

## Noun Phrases

### Structure: (Determiner) + (Adjective) + Noun + (Modifier)

**Examples**:

**Simple**:
- **kaeth** (device)
- **the kaeth** (the device)

**With Adjective**:
- **high drift-kae** (high drift-level)
- **the broken kaeth** (the broken device)

**With Modifier**:
- **kaeth im petaknul-7** (device at location-7)
- **kaeloth of Bureau** (seer of Bureau)

---

### Determiners (Borrowed from Common)

Sybari lacks native articles; borrows from Common:

- **the**: Definite article (the kaeth)
- **a/an**: Indefinite article (a seer)
- **this/that**: Demonstratives (this device)
- **some/many**: Quantifiers (some forecasts)

**Formal Sybari**: Often omits articles (context determines definiteness)
**Street Sybari**: Uses Common articles freely

---

### Possession

**Pattern 1** (Genitive particle **-of**):
- **kaeth of kaeloth** (device of seer = seer's device)
- **nareta of oracle** (forecast of oracle)

**Pattern 2** (Possessive pronouns from Common):
- **my kaeth** (my device)
- **their nareta** (their forecast)

**Pattern 3** (Compound):
- **kaeloth-kaeth** (seer-device = seer's device)
- Less common; used in technical jargon

---

## Verb Phrases

### Basic Structure: Verb + (Tense) + (Evidential)

**Required**: Evidential on main verb (formal contexts)

**Examples**:

**Simple Present**:
- **shen-mar** (speak-witnessed = "speaks/spoke, I witnessed")
- **kael-shen** (see-oracle = "sees, oracle shows")

**With Tense**:
- **shen-va-mar** (speak-past-witnessed = "spoke, I witnessed")
- **shen-na-shen** (speak-future-oracle = "will speak, oracle predicts")

**With Aspect**:
- **shen-ma-mar** (speak-progressive-witnessed = "is speaking, I witness")

---

### Evidential Placement

**Always final** on verb:

**Correct**:
- **shen-va-mar** (spoke-past-witnessed)
- **vesh-commit-past-shen** (violence-commit-past-oracle)

**Incorrect**:
- ✗ **mar-shen-va** (evidential before tense)
- ✗ **shen-mar-va** (evidential before tense)

---

### Negation

**Pattern**: **ne-** prefix on verb

**Examples**:

**ne-shen** (not-speak):
- "doesn't speak" / "didn't speak"

**ne-kael-mar** (not-see-witnessed):
- "didn't see, I witnessed" (witnessed the NOT seeing)

**ne-vesh-nareta-shen** (not-violence-forecast-oracle):
- "oracle shows no violence forecast"

---

### Modal Verbs (Borrowed from Common)

Sybari borrows modal constructions from Common:

**can/could**:
- "can shen-mar" (can speak, witnessed ability)

**must/should**:
- "must kael-shen" (must see, oracle requires)

**may/might**:
- "might vesh-ath" (might be violent, probably)

**Integration**: Modals take Common syntax; main verb takes Sybari evidential

---

## Questions

### Yes/No Questions

**Pattern 1** (Intonation): Rising intonation on statement

**Statement**: kaeth works-mar (device works, I witnessed)
**Question**: kaeth works-mar? (device works, I witnessed?)

---

**Pattern 2** (Question particle **-nara**):

**kaeth works-nara?**
- kaeth (device) + works-nara (works-questioned)
- "Does the device work?" (questioning status)

---

### Wh-Questions (Information Questions)

**Question words** (borrowed from Common):

- **what**: What nareta-shen? (What does oracle show?)
- **where**: Where petaknul-im? (Where is the location?)
- **when**: When vesh-nareta? (When is violence forecast?)
- **who**: Who kaeloth-mar? (Who is the seer, witnessed?)
- **why**: Why drift-kae high-shen? (Why is drift level high, oracle shows?)
- **how**: How kaeth calibrated-mar? (How is device calibrated, I witnessed?)

**Word Order**: Question word + Standard SVO

---

## Adjectives & Adverbs

### Adjective Placement

**Before noun** (attributive):
- **high drift-kae** (high drift-level)
- **broken kaeth** (broken device)
- **violent vesh** (violent violence = extreme violence)

**After copula** (predicative):
- **drift-kae is high-mar** (drift-level is high, witnessed)
- **kaeth seems broken-ath** (device seems broken, probably)

---

### Adverb Formation & Placement

**Formation**: Adjective + **-ol** OR use adjective + **-ly** (Common)

**Examples**:
- vish (violent) → **vish-ol** OR **violently**
- quick → **quickly**
- true (mir) → **mir-ol** OR **truly**

**Placement**: After verb (usually)
- shen-mar quickly (spoke quickly, witnessed)
- kael-shen mir-ol (sees truly, oracle shows)

---

### Comparison

**Pattern** (borrowed from Common):

**Comparative**: Adjective + **-er**
- high → higher
- quick → quicker
- drift-kae higher-mar (drift-level higher, witnessed)

**Superlative**: Adjective + **-est**
- high → highest
- quick → quickest
- drift-kae highest-shen (drift-level highest, oracle shows)

---

## Compound Sentences

### Coordination (And, Or, But)

**Conjunctions** (borrowed from Common):

**And**:
- kaeloth shen-mar **and** kaeth shows-shen
- (Seer spoke, witnessed AND device shows, oracle confirms)

**Or**:
- vesh-nareta **or** ne-vesh-nareta
- (Violence forecast OR no violence forecast)

**But**:
- kael-shen **but** ne-kael-mar
- (Oracle shows seeing BUT I didn't witness)

---

### Subordination (Complex Sentences)

**Subordinating conjunctions** (borrowed):

**If/Then**:
- **If** drift-kae high-shen, **then** recalibrate-teth
- (If drift level high, oracle shows, then must recalibrate, deduced)

**Because**:
- vesh-occurred **because** kaeth predicted-shen
- (Violence occurred because device predicted, oracle showed)

**When**:
- **When** kael-mar, shen-mar immediately
- (When saw, witnessed, spoke immediately, witnessed)

---

## Evidentials in Grammar

### Required Contexts

**Formal Sybari** (Technical/Bureaucratic):
- **Every main verb** must have evidential
- Subordinate clauses optional

**Example**:
"Kaeloth shen-mar that vesh-nareta-shen"
- Main verb: shen-mar (spoke, witnessed) - evidential required
- Subordinate: vesh-nareta-shen (violence forecast, oracle) - evidential required

---

### Optional Contexts

**Street Sybari**:
- Evidentials often dropped
- Used only for emphasis

**Example**:
"Kaeloth said violence coming"
- No evidentials (informal speech)
- If emphasizing: "Kaeloth said-mar violence coming" (I HEARD him say it)

---

### Evidential Agreement

**When stacking evidentials**, order matters:

**Primary source first**:
- **vesh-mar-shen**: violence-witnessed-oracle
- (I witnessed violence AND oracle confirmed)

**Secondary source second**:
- **vesh-shen-mar**: violence-oracle-witnessed
- (Oracle showed violence AND I confirmed by witnessing)

**Meaning difference**: Subtle (which source came first chronologically)

---

## Pronouns

### Personal Pronouns (Borrowed from Common)

Sybari lacks native pronouns; uses Common forms:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | I, me | we, us |
| 2nd | you | you |
| 3rd | **ith** (indigenous) OR he/she/it/they | they |

**Note**: **ith** is gender-neutral third-person (indigenous origin)
- Modern Sybari uses both ith and Common he/she/it
- Formal: ith (neutral)
- Informal: he/she based on referent

---

### Demonstratives

**Borrowed from Common**:
- **this/these**: Proximal (near speaker)
- **that/those**: Distal (far from speaker)

**Usage**:
- this kaeth (this device)
- those kaelothel (those seers)

---

## Copula (To Be)

### Present Tense

**Pattern**: Subject + **is/are** + Predicate

**Examples**:
- kaeth **is** broken-mar (device is broken, witnessed)
- drift-kae **is** high-shen (drift-level is high, oracle shows)
- kaelothel **are** at petaknul-7-mar (seers are at location-7, witnessed)

**Evidentials**: Attach to adjective/predicate, not copula

---

### Past/Future

**Pattern**: Subject + **was/were/will be** + Predicate

**Examples**:
- kaeth **was** broken-va-mar (device was broken, past, witnessed)
- drift-kae **will be** high-na-shen (drift-level will be high, future, oracle predicts)

---

## Special Constructions

### Passive Voice

**Pattern**: Subject + **be** + past participle + **(by agent)**

**Active**: kaeloth calibrated-mar kaeth
- (Seer calibrated device, witnessed)

**Passive**: kaeth **was calibrated**-mar (by kaeloth)
- (Device was calibrated, witnessed, by seer)

**Evidential placement**: On past participle

---

### Imperative (Commands)

**Pattern**: Verb (bare form) + (evidential optional)

**Examples**:
- **Shen!** (Speak!)
- **Calibrate kaeth!** (Calibrate device!)
- **Kael-mar!** (Look/witness!)

**With evidential** (emphasizes source of command):
- **Shen-shen!** (Speak, oracle commands!)
- **Calibrate-teth!** (Calibrate, logic requires!)

---

### Conditional Sentences

**Real Conditionals** (If X, then Y):
- **If** drift-kae high-shen, **then** recalibrate-teth
- (If drift level high, oracle shows, then must recalibrate, deduced)

**Unreal Conditionals** (If X were true, then Y would):
- **If** kaeth **were** calibrated-ath, drift-kae **would be** low-teth
- (If device were calibrated, probably, drift level would be low, deduced)

---

## Register Variation in Grammar

### Technical Sybari (Formal)

**Characteristics**:
- Strict SVO order
- All evidentials required
- No article omission
- Full morphology
- No contractions

**Example**:
"The kaeloth-el shen-mar that the nareta-kaeth shows-shen vesh-probability 60% im petaknul-7-designation."

---

### Bureaucratic Sybari (Standard)

**Characteristics**:
- Standard SVO
- Evidentials on main verbs
- Some article omission
- Standard morphology
- Rare contractions

**Example**:
"Kaelothel shen-mar nareta-kaeth shows-shen vesh-probability 60% at petaknul-7."

---

### Street Sybari (Informal)

**Characteristics**:
- Mixed SVO/SOV (indigenous bleeding through)
- Evidentials often dropped
- Articles from Common
- Simplified morphology
- Common contractions

**Example**:
"Seers said oracle shows 60% violence prob at District 7, yeah?"

---

## Indigenous Grammar Survival

### SOV Word Order (Underground)

**Original Kael'nir**:
- kaeloth nareta kael-va-kel
- (seer forecast saw-past-ancestral)
- "The seer saw the forecast" (ancestral knowledge)

**Modern "Corruption"** (illegal):
- kaeloth vesh-nareta shen-mar
- (seer violence-forecast spoke-witnessed)
- Subject + Object + Verb = SOV

**If discovered**: Arrest; charge: "linguistic corruption"

---

### Honorific Particles (Suppressed)

**Original Tav'mora** had honorific system:
- **-tav**: Respect marker (elders, ancestors)
- **-kesh**: Humility marker (speaker lowers self)

**Example** (illegal):
- kaeloth-tav shen-kel
- (seer-honorific spoke-ancestral)
- "The respected seer spoke from ancestral knowledge"

**Modern**: Eliminated ("egalitarian" language)

---

## Grammatical Politics

### European Control

**Oracle Houses & Universities**:
- Define "correct" grammar
- SVO required (suppress indigenous SOV)
- Evidentials mandatory (but simplified from original 16)
- "Pure" Sybari excludes indigenous grammatical features

---

### Indigenous Resistance

**Street Sybari**:
- SOV sometimes used (political act)
- Evidentials dropped (rejection of European precision)
- Mixed grammar (Common + Sybari + indigenous)

**Underground**:
- Full SOV (traditional Kael'nir)
- Original evidentials (all 16, if elders remember)
- Honorifics preserved (secret)

---

## Common Errors

### European Learners

**Missing evidentials**:
- ✗ "Kael oracle" 
- ✓ "Kael-shen" (saw, oracle showed)

**Wrong word order**:
- ✗ "Shen kaeloth vesh" (VSO)
- ✓ "Kaeloth shen vesh" (SVO)

---

### Indigenous Speakers

**"Wrong" word order** (traditional SOV):
- ✗ "Kaeloth vesh shen" (SOV, illegal)
- ✓ "Kaeloth shen vesh" (SVO, required)

**Using suppressed features**:
- ✗ "Kaeloth-tav" (honorific, illegal)
- ✓ "Kaeloth" (no honorific)

---

## Sample Sentences Across Complexity

### Simple

**kaeloth shen-mar**
- seer spoke-witnessed
- "The seer spoke (I witnessed)"

---

### Medium

**kaeth shows-shen vesh-probability 60%**
- device shows-oracle violence-probability 60%
- "The device shows 60% violence probability (oracle confirms)"

---

### Complex

**The kaelothel shen-mar-shen that nareta-kaeth im petaknul-7-designation shows-shen vesh-probability-kae excessive-mar and drift-kae low-teth**

**Breakdown**:
- The kaelothel = the seers
- shen-mar-shen = spoke-witnessed-oracle (I witnessed them speak AND oracle confirmed)
- that = subordinating conjunction
- nareta-kaeth im petaknul-7-designation = forecast-device at location-7-formal
- shows-shen = displays-oracle
- vesh-probability-kae excessive-mar = violence-probability-level excessive-witnessed
- and = coordination
- drift-kae low-teth = drift-level low-deduced

**Translation**:
"The seers stated (witnessed and oracle-confirmed) that the forecast device at Location 7 (formal designation) shows (oracle confirms) excessive violence probability level (witnessed) and low drift level (deduced)"

---

## The Irony of Grammar

**Europeans claim**: "We imposed rational SVO structure on primitive indigenous languages"

**Reality**: Destroyed sophisticated SOV system (Kael'nir) with complex evidentials, honorifics, and philosophical depth. Imposed simpler European structure. Now claim "improvement."

**Every sentence structure is reminder**: Grammar was stolen, simplified, weaponized.
