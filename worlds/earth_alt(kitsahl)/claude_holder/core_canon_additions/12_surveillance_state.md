# The Surveillance State

**The Oracle Bureau**: Government prophecy arm that monitors populations, predicts crimes, and maintains social control through "preventative policing"

**Founded**: 1823 (British Empire); spread globally by 1850s

**Justification**: "Preventing crime before it occurs makes society safer"

**Reality**: Systematic oppression disguised as public safety

---

## Bureau Structure

### Organization (British Model, Copied Globally)

**National Level**:

**Bureau Central** (London):
- Director-General (Cabinet-level appointment)
- Oracle Analysis Division (hundreds of operators)
- Prediction Research (improving methods)
- Coordination (oversees regional bureaus)

**Regional Bureaus** (Major cities):
- Regional Director
- Local oracle arrays (room-sized installations)
- Precinct stations (smaller devices)
- Field agents (enforcement)

**Budget** (1870s, British Empire):
- £10 million annually
- Funded by taxes
- **Comparison**: Larger than education budget

---

### Personnel

**Oracle Operators** (Tier 3):
- Run prediction systems
- Interpret results
- Generate daily forecasts
- Pay: £80-120/year
- **Stress**: High (knowing future crimes burdensome)

**Field Agents** (Tier 3-4):
- Execute arrests based on predictions
- Investigate high-probability individuals
- Patrol designated areas
- Pay: £60-100/year
- **Moral burden**: Arresting people who haven't committed crimes yet

**Analysts** (Tier 2-3):
- Study patterns
- Improve algorithms
- Recommend policy
- Pay: £100-200/year

**Leadership** (Tier 1-2):
- Directors, commissioners
- Political appointees
- Pay: £300-1,000/year
- **Connections**: Often rotate between Bureau and Oracle Houses

---

## Surveillance Systems

### Daily Prediction Routine

**Morning Cycle** (5:00 AM):

**City-Wide Scan**:
- Oracle operators run hundreds of queries
- "Will crime occur in [District X, Block Y] today?" (repeat for all blocks)
- Results compiled into "Daily Threat Assessment"
- High-probability areas flagged for patrol

**Example - Greymouth Bureau** (Typical day, 1872):

**Query Results**:
- Tidemark (Tier 5, indigenous neighborhood): 85% crime probability
- Factory District (Tier 4): 65% crime probability
- Middle Heights (Tier 3): 30% crime probability
- Admiralty Heights (Tier 1): 5% crime probability

**Resource Allocation**:
- 60% of patrols → Tidemark
- 30% → Factory District
- 10% → Middle/Admiralty Heights

**The Problem**: Self-fulfilling prophecy
- More patrols = more arrests
- More arrests = "confirms" high crime rate
- High crime rate = justifies more patrols

---

### Individual Monitoring

**High-Risk Registry**:

**Criteria for Inclusion**:
- Past arrest (even if acquitted)
- Indigenous ancestry (automatic flag)
- Union membership (political dissent)
- Living in high-crime area
- **Oracle prediction**: "Probability of future crime >60%"

**Consequences**:
- Weekly check-ins (mandatory reporting)
- Employment restrictions (can't work certain jobs)
- Travel limitations (must notify Bureau before leaving city)
- Pre-emptive detention (if probability spikes)

**Number Registered** (1870s Greymouth): ~15,000 people (8% of population)

---

**Case Study - Sarah Blackwater**:

**Identity**: Indigenous woman, age 28, domestic worker

**Registered**: Age 18 (arrested at protest; charges dropped)

**Current Status** (1872):
- Weekly check-ins (10 years now)
- Oracle shows: 55% crime probability (just under pre-emptive detention threshold)
- Can't leave Greymouth (travel requires permission)
- Can't work government jobs (security risk)
- Subject to random searches

**Her Crime**: None. Arrested once at 18; no conviction. Monitored for decade.

**Her Future**: Oracle predicts she'll remain "high-risk" until age 50+

**Why**: Indigenous + past arrest + poor neighborhood = permanent surveillance

---

## Precrime Systems

### The Philosophy

**Official Doctrine**:
"If we can see crimes before they occur, we have moral obligation to prevent them. Arresting someone before they commit crime saves potential victims."

**Legal Framework**:
- Preventative Detention Act (1842)
- Allows arrest for "high probability of future criminal activity"
- No crime required; just oracle prediction

**Philosophical Problems**:

**Free Will**: Can someone "choose" not to commit crime they haven't committed yet?

**Evidence**: Oracle prediction is only evidence; no actual crime occurred

**Burden of Proof**: Accused must prove they WON'T commit crime (proving negative)

**Appeals**: If released, oracle still predicts crime; arrested again

---

### Precrime Categories

**Violent Crime Prediction**:
- Threshold: 70% probability of assault/murder within 30 days
- Response: Immediate arrest; preventative detention
- Duration: Until oracle shows <30% probability (often months/years)
- **Success rate**: Bureau claims 80% prevention; critics dispute

**Property Crime Prediction**:
- Threshold: 60% probability of theft within 14 days
- Response: Enhanced surveillance; arrest if probability increases
- Common in poor neighborhoods (desperation = high theft probability)

**Political Crime Prediction**:
- Threshold: 50% probability of riot/sedition/conspiracy
- Response: Pre-emptive arrest of organizers
- **Effect**: Prevents protests, strikes, political organizing

---

### The Self-Negating Paradox

**The Problem**:

**Scenario**: Oracle predicts John will commit theft tomorrow

**Action**: Bureau arrests John today (preventative)

**Result**: John doesn't commit theft (he's in jail)

**Question**: Was oracle right or wrong?

**Bureau Answer**: "Right! We prevented the crime oracle showed!"

**Critic's Answer**: "We don't know. Maybe John wasn't going to commit crime anyway. No way to prove."

**The Impossibility**: Can't prove counterfactual. Did crime not occur because Bureau prevented it, or because oracle was wrong?

**Bureau Strategy**: Claim all prevented predictions as successes (inflates statistics)

---

## Neighborhood Surveillance

### Geographic Targeting

**High-Surveillance Zones** (Greymouth):

**Tidemark** (Tier 5, indigenous):
- Daily oracle scans
- Constant patrols (10+ agents at any time)
- Checkpoints (papers checked)
- Curfews (10 PM; violators arrested)
- **Residents**: Feel occupied

**Factory District** (Tier 4):
- Regular scans
- Frequent patrols
- Union activity monitored
- Strike predictions (arrest organizers preventatively)

**Middle Heights** (Tier 3):
- Occasional scans
- Light patrols
- Generally left alone unless specific threat

**Admiralty Heights** (Tier 1):
- Minimal surveillance
- Oracle shows low crime probability
- When crimes occur (rare): Major investigation

**The Inequality**: Poor neighborhoods over-policed; wealthy neighborhoods under-policed

---

### The Surveillance Infrastructure

**Oracle Stations** (Greymouth, 1870s):

**Bureau Headquarters**:
- Massive oracle array (30+ devices)
- Dedicated power plant (steam)
- 50+ operators (24-hour shifts)
- Central coordination

**Precinct Houses** (12 across city):
- Medium oracle array (8-12 devices)
- 10-15 operators per shift
- Local patrol coordination

**Street-Level** (Emerging):
- Portable oracles (field agents carry)
- Limited accuracy (35-40%)
- Used for immediate decisions

**Data Storage**:
- Paper records (every prediction filed)
- Cross-indexed (name, location, crime type)
- Archives: Decades of predictions
- **Use**: "Previous predictions" increase future probability (feedback loop)

---

## Legal Framework

### Precrime Law

**Preventative Detention Act** (1842, British Empire):

**Section 1**: "Any person showing probability exceeding 60% of committing violent crime within 30 days may be detained preventatively"

**Section 2**: "Detention duration: Until oracle shows probability below 30% or 6 months, whichever is longer"

**Section 3**: "Burden of proof: Detained must demonstrate low future crime probability"

**Section 4**: "Oracle predictions admissible as sole evidence"

---

**Rights of the Detained**:

**"Guaranteed" Rights**:
- Lawyer (if can afford; public defenders overwhelmed)
- Appeal hearing (before Bureau tribunal, not independent court)
- Medical care (minimal; prison conditions)

**Denied Rights**:
- Bail (pre-crime detention is "preventative," not punishment)
- Trial by jury (no crime to try)
- Confronting accuser (accuser is oracle machine)

**Release Conditions**:
- Oracle shows <30% probability OR
- 6 months served (whichever is longer) OR
- Pay bond (£50-500; most can't afford)

---

### Court Challenges

**Constitutional Debates** (1840s-1870s):

**Liberty Advocates**:
"Arresting people for crimes they haven't committed violates fundamental rights. Prophecy isn't proof."

**Bureau Defense**:
"Rights of potential victims outweigh rights of potential criminals. Prevention better than punishment."

**Court Rulings** (Mostly favor Bureau):
- "Oracle predictions scientifically proven reliable"
- "Preventative detention is safety measure, not punishment"
- "Public welfare justifies limited liberty restrictions"

**Dissents** (Rare but passionate):

**Justice Margaret Thornhill** (1858 ruling):
"We create a world where being poor, being indigenous, being in wrong neighborhood is crime. The oracle merely quantifies our prejudices and calls them predictions. This is tyranny dressed as science."

**Result**: Dissent noted; majority opinion prevailed; Thornhill's career ended

---

## The Bureau's Claimed Successes

### Crime Reduction Statistics (Bureau Reports)

**Official Claims** (1870s):

"Since Bureau establishment (1823):
- Violent crime: Down 40%
- Property crime: Down 35%
- Political unrest: Down 60%
- **Prevented crimes**: 50,000+ (oracle predictions that didn't occur)"

**How They Calculate "Prevention"**:
- Every oracle prediction that doesn't occur = "prevented crime"
- No accounting for false positives
- No way to verify if crime would have occurred

---

**Independent Analysis** (Underground statisticians, rare):

**Actual Findings**:
- Violent crime down ~15% (some reduction, mostly in wealthy areas)
- Property crime up 5% in poor areas (despite surveillance)
- Political unrest down 60% (but through suppression, not prevention)
- "Prevented crimes" = unprovable claim

**The Paradox**: Bureau claims success either way
- Crime occurs: "Would have been worse without Bureau"
- Crime doesn't occur: "Bureau prevented it"

---

## Resistance and Evasion

### Anti-Surveillance Tactics

**The Underground Manual** (Circulated 1860s):

**"How to Live Under Oracle Eyes"**

**1. Avoid Patterns**:
- Oracles predict based on patterns
- Be unpredictable (vary routes, schedules)
- Random behavior = harder to forecast

**2. Group Confusion**:
- Large gatherings create temporal "noise"
- Oracle accuracy drops in crowds
- Hide resistance in public festivals

**3. Counter-Prophecy**:
- Use own oracles to predict Bureau patrols
- Underground oracle-keepers help resisters
- Evade patrols before they arrive

**4. False Flags**:
- Create false patterns (decoys)
- Make Bureau predict wrong locations
- While they watch decoy, act elsewhere

**5. Time Delays**:
- Oracle forecast window is days/weeks
- Act outside window (very short-term decisions)
- Spontaneity = unpredictable

---

### The Oracle Resistance (Movement)

**Founded**: ~1850s (informal networks)

**Goals**:
- Expose Bureau abuses
- Free precrime detainees
- Destroy surveillance infrastructure
- **Long-term**: Abolish Bureau

**Tactics**:

**Legal**:
- Court challenges (mostly fail)
- Public testimony (often arrested)
- Pamphlets (banned but circulate)

**Illegal**:
- Sabotage oracle devices (break machines)
- Free detainees (jailbreaks)
- Assassinate Bureau officials (rare; heavily punished)
- Underground railroad (hide fugitives from Bureau)

**Bureau Response**:
- Oracle predictions identify resistance
- Pre-emptive arrests
- Infiltrators (Bureau plants in resistance)
- **Result**: Resistance constantly disrupted but never eliminated

---

## Psychological Impact

### On Bureau Personnel

**Operator Burnout**:
- See predictions of violence, death, suffering
- Can prevent some; not all
- **Moral burden**: "I knew this would happen; couldn't stop it"
- High turnover (average tenure: 3 years)

**Agent Trauma**:
- Arresting people who haven't committed crimes
- Watching detainees protest innocence
- Knowing some predictions are wrong
- **Coping**: Dehumanize targets ("they would have done it"), alcohol abuse

**Leadership Corruption**:
- Power to arrest based on prophecy
- Political use (target enemies)
- Bribery (pay to lower oracle prediction)
- **Justification**: "Greater good requires difficult choices"

---

### On Surveilled Populations

**Constant Fear**:
- Never know if oracle flagged you
- Any behavior could trigger prediction
- Bureau could arrest at any moment
- **Psychological**: Like living under sword of Damocles

**Community Breakdown**:
- Neighbors inform (Bureau pays for tips)
- Can't trust anyone (might be informant)
- Collective action difficult (Bureau predicts organizing)
- **Isolation**: Everyone protects self; community bonds dissolve

**Internalized Surveillance**:
- Self-police behavior (assume Bureau watching)
- Conform to avoid suspicion
- Don't resist (not worth the risk)
- **Goal achieved**: Population controls itself

---

## The Expansion

### Global Spread (1823-1870s)

**British Empire** (1823):
- First Bureau established
- Model for colonial bureaus
- India, Australia, Caribbean, Africa

**United States** (1840s):
- Federal Oracle Bureau
- State-level bureaus
- Heavy use in Reconstruction South (controlling freed slaves)

**France** (1830s):
- État Oracle (state-run)
- Tighter government integration
- Colonial bureaus in empire

**Germany** (Post-1871):
- Rapid adoption
- Prussian efficiency
- Political surveillance focus

**Other Powers**:
- Russia (Okhrana oracle division)
- Japan (Meiji government adopting, 1870s)
- Most "civilized" nations have bureaus by 1870s

---

### Colonial Bureaus (Special Focus)

**Purpose**: Control colonized populations

**Methods**:
- Predict indigenous resistance
- Pre-emptive arrests of leaders
- Suppress traditional oracle practice
- **Justify colonialism**: "Preventing savagery"

**Example - India**:
- British Bureau established 1830s
- Monitors major cities
- Predicts unrest (arrests before riots)
- Suppresses indigenous oracle traditions
- **Effect**: Deeper colonial control

---

## The Philosophical Crisis

### Does Prophecy Eliminate Free Will?

**The Dilemma**:

**If oracle predicts I'll commit crime**:
- Can I choose not to? (Free will exists)
- Or is future fixed? (Determinism)
- If I'm arrested before acting, did I have choice?

**Bureau Position**:
"Oracle shows probable future. You can choose differently. But probability is real. We act on probability to protect society."

**Philosopher's Critique**:
"If I'm arrested before I can act, how do I prove I would have chosen differently? Your 'prevention' makes free will irrelevant."

**Legal Consequence**:
- Courts assume oracle predictions are accurate
- Burden on accused to prove they wouldn't have acted
- Proving you wouldn't do something you haven't done = impossible
- **Result**: Oracle prediction becomes self-fulfilling prophecy

---

### The Moral Question

**Is It Just?**

**Utilitarian Argument** (Bureau):
"Preventing one crime justifies restricting one person's liberty. Greatest good for greatest number."

**Rights Argument** (Critics):
"Liberty is fundamental right. Can't be restricted without crime committed. Potential victims don't have more rights than potential criminals."

**Consequentialist Debate**:
"Does precrime actually prevent crime? Or just relocate it, criminalize poverty, and oppress minorities?"

**No Consensus** (1870s): Philosophical debate continues; Bureau operates regardless

---

## The Future of Surveillance (1870s Predictions)

### Where This Goes

**Bureau Internal Forecasts** (Long-range, low confidence):

**Next 10 years**:
- Expand surveillance (more devices, more areas)
- Improve accuracy (target: 70% standard)
- International cooperation (share predictions across empires)

**Next 20-30 years**:
- Comprehensive monitoring (entire population tracked)
- Crystal scarcity may limit expansion
- Alternative technologies? (research ongoing)

**Potential Crisis**:
- Public backlash if abuses too visible
- Legal challenges accumulating
- Resistance movements growing
- **Oracle prediction**: "60% probability major surveillance reform within 30 years"

**Bureau Response**: Prepare for reform while resisting it

---

## The Indigenous Perspective

### Surveillance As Continuation

**Indigenous View**:
"You stole our prophecy. Now you use it to hunt us. The oracle sees us planning resistance. You arrest us before we act. Our own knowledge weaponized against us."

**The Cycle**:
- Oracle knowledge stolen from indigenous peoples
- Bureau uses stolen knowledge to surveil indigenous descendants
- Predict resistance, arrest leaders, prevent organizing
- **Prophecy becomes tool of genocidal continuation**

**Bureau Justification**:
"High crime rates in indigenous neighborhoods are objective fact. Oracle merely reflects reality."

**Indigenous Response**:
"You created the poverty, the desperation, the crime. Oracle reflects your oppression. Then you use it to justify more oppression. This is colonialism perfected."

---

## The Hope

**For Resistance**:
"One day, the oracles will fail. Crystal scarcity will limit them. New technologies will emerge. Or people will simply refuse to accept this. The surveillance state isn't inevitable. Nothing is."

**For Bureau**:
"We prevent crime. We save lives. The cost is liberty for those who would have harmed others. This is just trade. And it works."

**For Future**:
Unknown. Oracle predictions unclear beyond 30 years. But both sides prepare for the coming confrontation.
