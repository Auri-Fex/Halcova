- Strip-mines sacred sites (doesn't acknowledge spiritual significance)

**Labor Relations**:
- Factory workers (Tier 4): £30-40/year
- Operators (Tier 3): £60-100/year  
- Executives (Tier 2): £500-2,000/year
- **Ratio**: Lowest paid to CEO: 1:100+

**Political Influence**:

---

### 2. Resonance Works Manufacturing (British, Founded 1738)

**Founder**: Dr. Cornelius Hartwell (1692-1764)

**Origin Story (Official)**:
"Dr. Hartwell, a pioneering alchemist and engineer, perfected the mechanical replication of temporal resonance, enabling mass production of oracle devices for the betterment of mankind."

**Origin Story (Truth)**:
- Hartwell was apprentice in Forced Teaching program (1714-1720)
- Five indigenous oracle-keepers tortured into teaching him
- All five killed after extraction complete (1721)
- Hartwell published their knowledge as his doctoral thesis (1722)
- Built first factory using their techniques (1738)
- **Personal correspondence** (found in archives): "The savages' knowledge proves useful, though they themselves were worthless"

---

**Business Model**:
- Mass manufacture of oracle devices
- Three product lines: Premium, Standard, Budget
- Sells to other Oracle Houses, governments, direct consumers
- **Volume strategy**: High quantity, moderate margins

**Specialization**: Manufacturing/hardware
- Device production (5,000+ units/year)
- Components for other manufacturers
- Replacement parts, maintenance
- Custom builds for industrial clients

**Technology**:
- Pioneered mass-production techniques
- Standardized components (interchangeable parts)
- Quality tiers (premium: 60%; standard: 45%; budget: 35% accuracy)

**Market Position**: #2 by revenue (£35 million annually); #1 by units sold

---

**Current Leadership** (1870s):

**Sir Geoffrey Hartwell** (Great-grandson):
- Age: 48
- Reputation as "self-made man" (inherited empire worth millions; claims credit for growth)
- Advocates for "free markets" (while maintaining monopoly)

**Corporate Practices**:

**Factory Conditions**:
- 12-hour workdays
- Child labor (age 10+)
- High injury rate (crystal dust causes silicosis)
- Workers who unionize: Fired (Bureau predicts "labor agitation"; pre-emptive termination)

**Crystal Sourcing**:
- Buys from independent miners (cheaper than own operations)
- No questions about source (indigenous sacred sites destroyed)
- **Cost focus**: Lowest-grade crystals acceptable (profit margins)

**Innovation**:
- R&D department (trying to break 65% accuracy plateau)
- Synthetic crystal research (failed so far)
- Miniaturization efforts (limited success)

---

### 3. Chronos Financial Services (British, Founded 1742)

**Founder**: Marcus Redding (1698-1769)

**Origin Story (Official)**:
"Marcus Redding revolutionized finance by applying oracle technology to risk assessment, creating the modern prophetic economy."

**Origin Story (Truth)**:
- Redding's fortune from Andean crystal mining (1720s-1730s)
- Enslaved indigenous peoples to extract crystals from sacred mountains
- Thousands died in mines (accidents, silicosis, brutal conditions)
- Sold crystals to early Oracle Houses; invested profits
- Founded Chronos (1742) as financial oracle service
- **Used stolen indigenous knowledge of crystal locations** (torture-extracted, purchased from Spanish)

---

**Business Model**:
- Banking with prophetic risk assessment
- Insurance (using oracle predictions)
- Investment services (forecasting returns)
- **Unique angle**: Combines prophecy with finance

**Specialization**: Risk/finance
- Loan default prediction
- Insurance claim forecasting
- Investment opportunity identification
- Economic trend analysis

**Market Position**: #3 by revenue (£30 million annually)

---

**Services**:

**Prophetic Loans**:
- Use oracles to predict repayment likelihood
- Higher rates for "high-risk" borrowers (often indigenous, working-class)
- Lower rates for "low-risk" (wealthy, oracle-access holders)
- **Result**: Prophecy reinforces economic inequality

**Oracle Insurance**:
- Life insurance: Predict death dates (charge accordingly)
- Business insurance: Forecast disasters, price premiums
- **Problem**: Pre-existing conditions include "indigenous ancestry" (higher premiums)

**Investment Prophecy**:
- Predict stock movements (40-60% accuracy)
- Aggregate predictions from multiple sources
- Sell forecasts to wealthy clients
- **Legal but unethical**: Prophetic insider trading

---

**Current Leadership** (1870s):

**Lady Amelia Redding-Ashford** (Great-great-granddaughter):
- Age: 41
- First woman to head Big Five company (celebrated as feminist achievement)
- Maintains exploitative practices (uses feminism as cover for capitalism)

---

### 4. Destiny Oracle Corporation (American, Founded 1751)

**Founder**: Josiah Creed (1710-1782)

**Origin Story (Official)**:
"Pioneer Josiah Creed brought oracle technology to the American frontier, enabling westward expansion and manifest destiny."

- Participated in raids on indigenous villages
- Captured oracle-keepers, forced them to teach him
- Built first American devices (1748-1750)
- Founded company to supply settlers and military (1751)
- **Specialization**: Predicting indigenous resistance (helped genocidal campaigns)

---

**Business Model**:
- Government contracts (U.S. Army, Bureau)
- Settler/pioneer devices (portable, rugged)
- Land speculation (predict valuable territories)
- Mining operations (forecast mineral deposits)

**Specialization**: Frontier/military
- Portable oracles (battlefield use)
- Terrain/resource forecasting
- Indigenous resistance prediction
- Settlement planning

**Technology**:
- Ruggedized devices (survive frontier conditions)
- Lower accuracy (45-50%) but reliable
- Quick setup (important for mobile military)

**Market Position**: #4 by revenue (£25 million annually, 1870s)

---

**Historical Role**:

**Westward Expansion**:
- Provided oracles to Army (predict indigenous attacks)
- Sold devices to settlers (forecast land value, water sources)
- **Effect**: Accelerated indigenous dispossession
- Lakota, Cheyenne, others fought harder/longer but ultimately lost

**Indian Wars**:
- Army used Destiny oracles to predict resistance
- Pre-emptive strikes (attack before indigenous warriors mobilized)
- Supply forecasting (maintain sieges longer)
- **Indigenous perspective**: "They used our stolen knowledge to predict our movements, destroy our peoples"

---

**Current Leadership** (1870s):

**Colonel Marcus Creed** (Great-grandson):
- Age: 55
- Former military officer (Civil War veteran)
- Hard-line expansionist ("Manifest Destiny" believer)
- Lobbies for continued western expansion (more markets for his oracles)

**Corporate Practices**:

- Western mountains (prophecy identifies sites before indigenous peoples can hide them)
- Uses Army to secure mining operations

**Political Activities**:
- Finances anti-indigenous politicians
- Lobbies against treaty rights
- Uses prophecy to predict indigenous resistance (shares with military)
- **Goal**: Complete dispossession (more territory = more mining)

---

### 5. Prévoyance Industrielle (French, Founded 1748)

**Founder**: Étienne Laurent (1705-1771)

**Origin Story (Official)**:
"Étienne Laurent developed oracle technology in service of the French Republic, bringing prophetic equality to all citizens."

**Origin Story (Truth)**:
- Laurent was colonial administrator in Caribbean (1730s-1740s)
- Studied Spanish torture transcripts (same sources as British)
- Captured Haitian oracle-keepers (Vodou prophetic traditions)
- Forced extraction through torture (1742-1746)
- Built French devices (1747), founded company (1748)
- **Marketing**: "French innovation" (no mention of Haitian origins)

---

**Business Model**:
- State partnership (État Oracle contracts)
- French Empire focus (colonies, territories)
- European export (countries seeking British alternative)
- **Unique**: Claims "republican values" while maintaining oligopoly

**Specialization**: State/colonial
- Government prophecy (French bureaucracy)
- Colonial administration (predict unrest in empire)
- Military intelligence (rival British)

**Technology**:
- Good quality (55-60% accuracy)
- Aesthetically distinctive (French design sensibility)
- State-backed R&D (government funding)

**Market Position**: #5 by revenue (£20 million annually)

---

**Current Leadership** (1870s):

**Claude-Marie Laurent** (Grandson):
- Age: 62
- Claims republican politics (but runs capitalist empire)
- Close ties to French government
- **Hypocrisy**: Advocates "égalité" while profiting from colonial theft

**Corporate Practices**:

**Colonial Operations**:
- Algeria: Suppresses Berber oracle traditions; mines Atlas Mountains
- Indochina: Captures indigenous oracle-keepers; steals knowledge
- West Africa: Strip-mines sacred sites
- **French narrative**: "Bringing civilization" (means: stealing and destroying)

---

## Market Structure

### The Oligopoly Agreement (Unwritten)

**Price Fixing**:
- Big Five coordinate pricing (illegal but unprovable)
- "Market rates" established through back-channel communication
- **Use prophecy to coordinate**: Predict each other's price changes; match them

**Territory Division**:
- Informal spheres of influence
- British houses: Empire focus
- American houses: Americas focus
- French houses: French Empire
- **Overlap managed**: Through prophetic negotiation (predict conflicts; resolve before public)

**Competition Suppression**:
- New entrants predicted before they become threats
- Bought out, sued, or sabotaged
- **Prophetic advantage**: See competition coming; crush it early

---

### Why Monopoly Persists

**Barrier to Entry #1 - Capital**:
- Oracle manufacturing requires: Crystals, precision equipment, trained operators
- Initial investment: £50,000+ (beyond most entrepreneurs)

**Barrier to Entry #2 - Knowledge**:
- Big Five guard trade secrets (calibration methods, crystal sources)
- Patents block competition (even when patents are on stolen knowledge)

**Barrier to Entry #3 - Prophecy**:
- Big Five predict new competitors
- Can outmaneuver before competitor establishes
- **Prophetic advantage maintains monopoly**

**Government Regulation**:
- Attempted (1820s-1850s)
- Failed (Big Five predicted regulations; lobbied preventatively)
- Current state: Mostly unregulated (captured regulators)

---

## Crystal Trade

### Global Supply Chain (1870s)

**Extraction**:
- Sacred sites (indigenous lands)
- Mining companies (Big Five subsidiaries or contractors)
- Labor: Indigenous peoples, convicts, wage slaves

**Processing**:
- Cutting, polishing, quality grading
- Factories: Britain, France, United States
- Workers: Tier 4 (low wages, dangerous conditions)

**Distribution**:
- Crystal merchants (middlemen)
- Oracle manufacturers
- Final devices

**Prices** (1870s):

| Crystal Quality | Price/unit | Source |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Sacred-site premium | £50-100 | Andean, Indian sacred mountains |
| Standard mine-grade | £10-25 | Australian, African mines |
| Low-grade | £5-10 | Depleted sites, poor quality |

**Supply Crisis** (Emerging):
- Sacred sites being exhausted
- Quality declining
- Demand increasing
- **Predicted**: Crystal scarcity within 20-30 years

---

### Conflict Zones

**Active Crystal Wars** (1870s):

**East Africa**:
- British vs German competition
- Rich deposits discovered
- Indigenous peoples (Maasai, others) defending sacred lands
- **Prophecy use**: Both empires predict each other's moves; military escalation

**Andes**:
- Remaining sacred sites
- Indigenous resistance (armed defense of mountains)
- Corporate-backed military expeditions
- **Violence**: Hundreds killed annually

**Black Hills**:
- Lakota sacred land
- U.S. government broke treaty (gold + crystals found)
- Lakota resistance ongoing (1870s)
- **Prophecy**: Destiny Oracle predicts resistance; Army prepares accordingly

---

## Financial Markets

### Oracle-Enhanced Trading

**Stock Exchanges**:
- London, Paris, New York (all use oracle predictions)
- Traders with oracle access: 20-30% advantage
- Traders without: Disadvantaged
- **Result**: Wealth concentrates with oracle holders

**Prophetic Insider Trading**:
- Technically legal (no laws against using prophecy)
- Ethically dubious (knowing future = unfair advantage)
- **Debate**: Should oracle-based trading be regulated?
- **Big Five position**: "Free markets" (means: profitable for us)

---

### Insurance Industry

**Prophetic Risk Assessment**:
- Life insurance: Predict death (charge accordingly)
- Property insurance: Forecast disasters
- Business insurance: Predict failures
- **Problem**: Discrimination via prophecy

**Example**:

**Wealthy applicant**:
- Oracle predicts: 30 years life expectancy
- Premium: Low

**Indigenous applicant**:
- Oracle predicts: 15 years life expectancy
- Premium: High (or denied coverage)
- **Reality**: Oracle reflects existing inequality (poor die younger); prophecy used to justify charging poor more

---

## Labor & Oracle Operators

### The Operator Class

**Who They Are**:
- Middle-class (Tier 3)
- Technical training (6 months - 2 years)
- Run oracle devices for wealthy/corporations

**Working Conditions**:
- Oracle Houses: 10-12 hour days
- Bureau: Government hours (better than private sector)
- Factories: Production quotas (stressful)

**Pay**:
- Junior operators: £60-80/year
- Senior operators: £100-150/year
- Chief operators: £200-300/year

**Status**:
- Considered skilled labor
- Better than factory work (Tier 4)
- Worse than management (Tier 2)

---

### Operator Unions (Emerging 1870s)

**The Oracle Operators' Guild** (formed 1868):

**Demands**:
- Better pay (current wages don't match skill level)
- Shorter hours (8-hour day)
- Safety improvements (crystal dust exposure)

**Tactics**:
- Strikes (threaten to shut down oracle services)
- Collective bargaining
- **Problem**: Bureau predicts strikes; companies prepare

**Company Response**:
- Strikebreakers (hire replacements)
- Blacklists (union members unemployable)
- Bureau surveillance (predict union activity; arrest organizers for "conspiracy")

**Current Status**: Struggle ongoing; limited victories

---

## Public Access

### Tiered Oracle Access (1870s Greymouth)

**Tier 1 (Aristocracy)**:
- Personal oracle consultation ($50-200 per session)
- Premium devices at home (£300-500)
- Oracle House subscriptions (£500-1,000/year)
- **Access**: Unlimited

**Tier 2 (Wealthy Professionals)**:
- Oracle House consultations (occasional, expensive)
- Premium home devices (£200-300)
- **Access**: Regular but costly

**Tier 3 (Middle-Class)**:
- Consumer-grade devices (£50-80)
- Self-service (40-45% accuracy)
- Occasional professional consultation (special decisions)
- **Access**: Limited

**Tier 4-5 (Working-Class, Poor)**:
- No devices (can't afford)
- Public oracle parlors (£1-2 per question; low accuracy)
- **Access**: Minimal

**Indigenous Peoples**:
- No legal access (oracle use criminalized for indigenous practice)
- Subject to Bureau surveillance (prophecy used against them)
- **Access**: None (except underground/illegal)

---

## The Morality Question

### "Should Prophecy Be Profitable?"

**Big Five Position**:
"Oracle technology required massive investment to develop. Profit incentivizes innovation. Everyone benefits from market-driven progress."

**Socialist Critique**:
"You didn't develop it; you stole it. You profiteer from stolen knowledge. Prophecy should be public good, not private commodity."

**Indigenous Position**:
"It was never yours to sell. Our ancestors' sacred practice is not your property. This is ongoing theft."

**Liberal Reformers**:
"Perhaps some regulation? Public oracle access? Break up the monopoly?"

**Result** (1870s): Status quo persists. Too much money at stake. Too much political power. Too much prophetic advantage.
