## III. THE PRECRIME SYSTEM

### How It Works

**Step 1: Oracle Scanning**
- Greymouth Resonance Trust operates citywide oracle grid
- Continuous passive scanning of all residents
- Detects "temporal disturbances" (future criminal acts)
- ~100,000 readings per day (automated)

**Step 2: Algorithmic Filtering**
- Oracle Analysis Division processes readings
- Machine filters obvious false positives
- Analysts review flagged individuals
- ~5,000 readings per day require human review

**Step 3: Threat Assessment**
- Each reading assigned confidence score (0-100%)
- Severity rating (petty theft → murder → treason)
- Subject profile cross-referenced (prior history, associations)
- ~500 readings per day rated "actionable"

**Step 4: Prioritization**
- High confidence + high severity = immediate arrest
- Moderate scores = surveillance increase
- Low scores = monitoring only
- ~50-100 arrests per day in Greymouth

**Step 5: Intervention**
- **>80% confidence**: Immediate arrest, detention until forecast time passes
- **65-80% confidence**: Arrest if severity high; surveillance if lower
- **<65% confidence**: No arrest (monitoring only)

**Step 6: Disposition**
- Detained until "crime window" passes (hours to weeks)
- No trial (Precrime Act allows preventive detention)
- Release if incident doesn't occur
- Prosecution if evidence develops

### The Problems

**False Positives** (30-40%):
- Oracle readings are probabilistic, not certain
- System arrests thousands of innocents annually
- No compensation for wrongful detention
- Stigma follows the accused forever

**Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**:
- Arrest creates the crisis it predicts
- Example: Man forecasted to fight police → police arrest him → he fights → "prophecy" confirmed
- Bureau denies this happens; it happens constantly

**Class Bias**:
- Wealthy can afford lawyer reviews of oracle readings
- Poor arrested immediately, no review process
- Tier 5 residents scanned more frequently
- Indigenous peoples profiled systematically

**Political Abuse**:
- Labor organizers "forecasted" to commit crimes
- Indigenous activists "detected" as threats
- Journalists critical of Bureau = surveillance targets
- Dissent = precrime

## VI. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### The Precrime Act (1855, Imperial)

**Key Provisions**:
- Authorizes preventive detention based on oracle forecasts
- No trial required (administrative process)
- Maximum detention: Until forecast time window passes
- Bureau has final authority on release

**Requirements**:
- Confidence threshold: 65% minimum
- Severity threshold: Potential harm to persons or Crown interests
- Documentation: Oracle reading, analyst assessment, supervisor approval

**Protections** (theoretical):
- Right to review of oracle reading (if you can afford lawyer)
- Release if forecast window passes without incident
- Compensation for wrongful detention (never granted in practice)

**Reality**:
- Wealthy can challenge readings; poor cannot
- "Forecast windows" interpreted loosely
- Documentation often fabricated
- No meaningful oversight

### Supporting Legislation

**Oracle Grid Access Act (1865)**:
- Mandates oracle scanning for all residents
- Refusal = criminal offense
- Grants Bureau access to Trust grid data

**Public Safety Enhancement Act (1868)**:
- Warrant-free searches in "high-crime areas" (i.e., poor districts)
- Expanded Bureau jurisdiction
- Informant immunity provisions

**Indigenous Territories Security Act (1863)**:
- Special provisions for reservations
- Lower confidence threshold (50%) for indigenous suspects
- Collective punishment authorized

## VII. BUREAU CULTURE & RECRUITMENT

### Who Joins the Bureau

**Officer Class** (inspectors, analysts, administrators):
- Middle class, educated
- Believe in "scientific law enforcement"
- Many from military/police backgrounds
- See themselves as preventing harm

**Agent Class** (enforcement, surveillance):
- Working class, less educated
- Motivated by steady pay (3-5 Sovereigns/week)
- Often former soldiers
- Range from idealistic to brutal

**Informant Networks**:
- Recruited from all tiers
- Motivations: Money, fear, ideology, revenge
- Paid per actionable report (5-50 Credits)
- Social pariahs if discovered

### Institutional Values

**Efficiency**: Prevent maximum crime with minimum resources
**Order**: Social stability über alles
**Certainty**: Oracle readings treated as fact (despite 30-40% error rate)
**Loyalty**: To Bureau first, law second, truth never

### Corruption

**Widespread**:
- Evidence planting common
- Bribes accepted (especially from wealthy)
- Sexual exploitation of detainees
- Theft of confiscated property

**Tolerated**:
- As long as it doesn't disrupt operations
- Officers know to hide it
- Complaints ignored or punished

**Justified**:

## VIII. RESISTANCE & OPPOSITION

### Legal Challenges

**Citizens' Oracle Review League**:
- Wealthy reformers
- Challenge specific Bureau actions
- Occasional court victories (minor)
- Bureau ignores most rulings

**Attorneys Who Fight**:
- ~50 lawyers citywide
- Mostly pro bono for poor clients
- Harassed by Bureau (surveillance, audits)
- Some have "disappeared"

### Underground Opposition

**The Rememberers**:
- Document Bureau abuses
- Anonymous pamphlets distributed
- Maintain lists of disappeared
- Bureau priority target

**False Reading Networks**:
- Help people hide from oracle detection
- Oracle-blocking techniques (partially effective)
- Safe houses for those forecasted
- Extremely dangerous (death penalty if caught)

### Indigenous Resistance

**Kael'nir Approach**:
- Kill Bureau agents in interior territories
- Rescue prisoners from transport
- Destroy oracle grid infrastructure
- No mercy for collaborators

**Reservation Resistance**:
- Passive non-cooperation
- False information to informants
- Protect traditional practices
- Hide fugitives

### Worker Solidarity

**Informal Codes**:
- Don't inform on union organizers
- Warn each other of raids
- Support families of arrested
- "Accidents" happen to known informants

## IX. THE BUREAU IN STORIES

### How Characters Interact

**Tier 1-2**:
- Minimal interaction (unless politically active)
- Can afford lawyers if forecasted
- Some serve as informants (ideology or advancement)
- View Bureau as protecting them from "dangerous classes"

**Tier 3-4**:
- Regular checkpoint stops
- Neighborhood informants
- Fear precrime arrest (can't afford lawyers)
- Some become agents (economic mobility)

**Tier 5**:
- Constant surveillance
- Frequent arrests (often baseless)
- Informant networks everywhere
- Bureau is the enemy (universally)

**Indigenous**:
- Maximum surveillance
- Lowest threshold for arrest
- Collective punishment common
- Bureau = occupying force

### Plot Hooks

**Precrime Gone Wrong**:
- Character forecasted for crime they won't commit
- Must hide or prove innocence (impossible)
- Bureau closing in

**Inside the Bureau**:
- Agent discovers corruption/false readings
- Conscience vs. career
- Powerful enemies if they speak out

**The Disappeared**:
- Character's loved one taken by Bureau
- No record of arrest
- Quest to find them (Site 7?)

**False Reading Network**:
- Underground railroad for forecasted people
- Bureau infiltration threat
- Moral complexity (some ARE dangerous)

**Labor Organizing**:
- Oracle forecasts strike
- Bureau preparing mass arrests
- Race against time

**Indigenous Rescue**:
- Free Kael'nir bands raiding Bureau transport
- Rescue prisoners before Greystone
- Bureau pursuit

## X. BUREAU AESTHETICS

### Visual

**Uniforms**:
- Officers: Black suits, silver badges, Oracle House pins
- Agents: Black coats, truncheons, oracle-detection devices
- Special Ops: No uniforms (deniability)

**Architecture**:
- Black Tower: Imposing, authoritarian
- District stations: Fortress-like
- Checkpoints: Oracle-tech visible (intimidation)

**Technology**:
- Oracle readers (handheld, checkpoint-mounted)
- Pneumatic tube communication
- Telegraph for urgent messages
- Extensive filing systems

### Sonic

**Sounds of the Bureau**:
- Oracle hum (omnipresent near checkpoints)
- Pneumatic tubes whooshing
- Footsteps on stone (always approaching)
- Cell doors clanging
- Screaming (from interrogation floors)

**Silence**:
- Before a raid (eerie calm)
- When informants watch
- In cells after hours
- When they come for you

### Emotional

**Fear**: The Bureau's primary tool
**Paranoia**: Who's an informant?
**Helplessness**: No defense against prophecy
**Rage**: Injustice systemized
**Resignation**: "Nothing I can do"

---

*The Bureau doesn't prevent crime. It prevents resistance. Every arrest is political. Every oracle reading is a tool of control. They don't serve justice—they serve power.*

*And they're very, very good at it.*
