- 7% Indigenous
- 10% Other

### New Albion (The Territory)

**Major Settlements**:
- **Kitsahl** (380K) - Capital
- **Fort Coldheart** (12K) - Mining town
- **Southhaven** (45K) - Agricultural hub

## SYSTEMS

### Oracle Mechanics

**Six Domains** (what can be predicted):
1. Personal (individual futures)
2. Economic (markets, trade)
3. Political (elections, conflicts)
4. Natural (weather, disasters)
5. Social (trends, movements)
6. Temporal (time itself)

**Limitations**:
- Accuracy decreases with distance (time/space)
- Free will creates uncertainty
- Multiple futures possible
- Interference from other predictions

**Cost**: Expensive - only wealthy have regular access

### Alchemy System

**Purpose**: Energy source for oracle devices
- Crystals burned/dissolved for power
- Creates environmental catastrophe
- Worker exploitation in mines
- Complements oracle mechanics (not same system)

### Class System

**Five Tiers**:
1. **Tier 1** (2%) - Oracle elite, aristocracy (£2,000-20,000+/year)
2. **Tier 2** (8%) - Professionals (£300-2,000/year)
3. **Tier 3** (15%) - Middle class (£80-300/year)
4. **Tier 4** (40%) - Working class (£30-80/year)
5. **Tier 5** (35%) - Poor, marginalized (<£30/year)

**Mobility**: Near-impossible (oracle access ossifies hierarchy)

### Currency

**Sovereign** = Primary currency
- 1 Sovereign = 20 Shillings = 240 Pence
- 1 Sovereign ≈ £1 (British pound equivalent)

**Oracle Credits** = Premium currency for oracle services
- 1 Credit = 5 Sovereigns
- Only wealthy use regularly

---

## SOCIAL STRUCTURES

### Racial Hierarchy

**Top**: Anglo-European (British)
**Second**: Other Europeans (assimilable)
**Third**: East Asian ("perpetual foreigners")
**Bottom**: Indigenous peoples (most oppressed)

**Oracle Justification**: "Predictions prove hierarchy natural"
**Reality**: Oracle reflects existing racism, creates self-fulfilling prophecies

### Gender

**Patriarchal system** with class variations:
- Tier 1-2: Women confined to domestic sphere
- Tier 3-4: Women work out of necessity
- Tier 5: Gender roles collapse under survival pressure

**Indigenous traditions**: More egalitarian (suppressed by colonizers)

### Language

**Sybari** = Constructed language with three registers:
1. **Technical Sybari** - Oracle industry, elite
2. **Bureaucratic Sybari** - Government, business
3. **Street Sybari** - Working class, simplified

**Indigenous languages**: Criminalized (death penalty for public use)

## RESISTANCE

### Indigenous Resistance

**Free Kael'nir Bands** (North):
- Armed resistance in unconquered territories
- Monthly raids on mining operations
- Preservation of traditional oracle practices

**Urban Networks**:
- Underground language schools
- Secret traditional ceremonies
- Mutual aid and survival strategies
- Political activism (dangerous)

### Worker Resistance

**Labor Organizing**:
- Union formation (Bureau targets organizers)
- Strikes (oracle predicts, Bureau preempts)
- Cross-class solidarity (rare but real)

**False Reading Networks**:
- Help people hide from oracle detection
- Oracle-blocking techniques
- Safe houses for forecasted individuals
