# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP ACTION PLAN

## IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

Most of your files are **Google Docs** (.gdoc extension), which means:
- I cannot edit them directly from my tools
- **You** need to update them manually in Google Docs
- OR we can create NEW .md versions to replace them

## YOUR OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: Manual Update in Google Docs (Recommended for Quick Fix)

Open each .gdoc file in Google Docs and use Find & Replace:

**Critical Replacements**:
1. `Greymouth` → `Kitsahl`
2. `Graymouth` → `Kitsahl`
3. `Grey Bay` → `Kitsahl Bay`
4. `Fort Grey` → `Fort Kitsahl`
5. `Greymouth Resonance Trust` → `Kitsahl Resonance Trust`

**Files to Update** (in priority order):

**HIGH PRIORITY** - Do these first:
- [ ] places/greymouth_overview.md.gdoc (then rename to kitsahl_overview.md.gdoc)
- [ ] places/admiralty_heights.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/crown_square.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/the_tangles.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/foundry_row.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/tidemark.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/regional_context.md.gdoc
- [ ] places/city-naming-political-analysis.md.gdoc

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- [ ] economy/oracle_markets.md.gdoc
- [ ] economy/currency.md.gdoc
- [ ] economy/prices_wages.md.gdoc
- [ ] economy/crystal_economy.md.gdoc
- [ ] mechanics/oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc
- [ ] mechanics/04_oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc

**CHECK FOR REFERENCES** (may have few/none):
- [ ] All history/ files
- [ ] All timelines/ files
- [ ] All social_structures/ files
- [ ] people/class_tiers.md.gdoc

### OPTION 2: Export & Replace (More Work, Better Long-term)

1. Export all .gdoc files as Markdown
2. I update them with correct names
3. Delete old .gdoc versions
4. Upload corrected .md versions

**Pros**: All files in same format, easier to manage
**Cons**: Time-consuming initial setup

### OPTION 3: Hybrid Approach (Best Balance)

Keep .gdoc files but let me create corrected .md versions alongside them for the most important documents. Over time, phase out .gdocs.

## FILES I CAN UPDATE NOW

These are regular .md files I have access to:

✅ **ALREADY CORRECTED**:
- systems/bureau_preemptive_justice.md
- systems/greymouth_resonance_trust.md (needs rename)
- places/kitsahl_region_expansion.md

✅ **CAN UPDATE NOW**:
- language/ files (all .md)
- social_structures/ files (all .md)
- core_canon_additions/ files (all .md)

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS I'LL TAKE

### 1. Rename Trust File

systems/greymouth_resonance_trust.md → systems/kitsahl_resonance_trust.md

### 2. Update All .md Files

I'll scan and update:
- All language/ files
- All social_structures/ files  
- All core_canon_additions/ files

### 3. Create Master README

I'll create a comprehensive README.md for the root folder.

### 4. Create QUICK_REFERENCE.md

One-page essential facts sheet.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### Immediate (Today):

1. **Rename in Google Drive**:
   - places/greymouth_overview.md.gdoc → kitsahl_overview.md.gdoc

2. **Update these 7 place files** via Google Docs Find & Replace:
   - kitsahl_overview.md.gdoc
   - admiralty_heights.md.gdoc
   - crown_square.md.gdoc
   - the_tangles.md.gdoc
   - foundry_row.md.gdoc
   - tidemark.md.gdoc
   - regional_context.md.gdoc

3. **Update economy files** (4 files):
   - Use same find & replace

### This Week:

4. Check history/, timelines/, mechanics/ for any Greymouth references
5. Decide on folder reorganization (see CLEANUP_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md)

---

## CONSOLIDATION PLAN

### Duplicates to Merge:

**mechanics/ folder** - TWO oracle_mechanics files:
- Keep the more complete one
- Delete the other
- Which is more complete?

**status/ folder** - TWO BUILD_STATUS files:
- Merge into one
- Delete duplicate
- Which is current?

**social_structures/** - TWO racial_hierarchy files:
- 01_racial_hierarchy.md
- 04_racial_hierarchy.md
- Are these duplicates or different aspects?

### Folder Structure Simplification:

**Current**: 14 folders
**Proposed**: 7 organized folders

See CLEANUP_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md for detailed structure.

---

## PROGRESS TRACKER

### Name Corrections:
- [x] 3 new .md files (bureau, trust, region)
- [ ] 7 places .gdoc files
- [ ] 4 economy .gdoc files
- [ ] 2 mechanics .gdoc files
- [ ] Other files (TBD after check)

### File Management:
- [ ] Rename greymouth_resonance_trust.md → kitsahl_resonance_trust.md
- [ ] Consolidate oracle_mechanics duplicates
- [ ] Consolidate BUILD_STATUS duplicates
- [ ] Delete desktop.ini files (11 total)

### Organization:
- [ ] Create master README.md
- [ ] Create QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- [ ] Reorganize folders (optional)
- [ ] Create folder README files (optional)

## DECISION NEEDED

**Which approach do you prefer?**

A. **Manual Google Docs updates** (you do find-replace in Google Docs)
B. **Export → Update → Re-import** (I convert everything to .md)
C. **Hybrid** (keep .gdocs, I create .md versions for key files)

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!
