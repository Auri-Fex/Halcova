# ✅ CLEANUP & CONSOLIDATION - COMPLETED

## WHAT WAS DONE

### ✅ Name Corrections Applied

**Files Updated with Kitsahl/New Albion**:
- ✅ `systems/bureau_preemptive_justice.md`
- ✅ `systems/kitsahl_resonance_trust.md` (renamed from greymouth_resonance_trust.md)
- ✅ `places/kitsahl_region_expansion.md`

**All .md files checked**: Language, social_structures, and core_canon folders don't reference the city name.

### ✅ Organization Files Created

- ✅ `README.md` - Master overview and getting started guide
- ✅ `ACTION_PLAN.md` - Detailed action items
- ✅ `CLEANUP_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Full reorganization plan
- ✅ `NAME_CORRECTION_GUIDE.md` - Reference for corrections
- ✅ `CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` - Quick summary
- ✅ `IMMEDIATE_ACTION_REQUIRED.md` - Decision points

### ✅ Duplicates Identified

**Recommended Deletions** (based on accuracy/completeness):

1. **social_structures/04_racial_hierarchy.md** - DELETE
   - Keep: `01_racial_hierarchy.md` (more comprehensive)

2. **mechanics/04_oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc** - CHECK & CONSOLIDATE
   - Compare with `oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc`
   - Keep more complete version

3. **status/_BUILD_STATUS.md.gdoc** - CHECK & CONSOLIDATE
   - Compare with `BUILD_STATUS.md.gdoc`
   - Keep current version

## WHAT STILL NEEDS YOUR ACTION

### High Priority - Google Docs Files

These .gdoc files need manual find-replace in Google Docs:

**Places folder** (7 files):
- [ ] `places/greymouth_overview.md.gdoc` → rename to `kitsahl_overview.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/admiralty_heights.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/crown_square.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/the_tangles.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/foundry_row.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/tidemark.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `places/regional_context.md.gdoc`

**Economy folder** (4 files):
- [ ] `economy/oracle_markets.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `economy/currency.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `economy/prices_wages.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `economy/crystal_economy.md.gdoc`

**Mechanics folder** (2 files):
- [ ] `mechanics/oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc`
- [ ] `mechanics/04_oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc`

**Find & Replace in each**:
```
Find: "Greymouth" → Replace: "Kitsahl"
Find: "Grey Bay" → Replace: "Kitsahl Bay"
Find: "Fort Grey" → Replace: "Fort Kitsahl"
```

### Medium Priority - Consolidation

**Delete these duplicates**:
- [ ] `social_structures/04_racial_hierarchy.md` (keep 01 version)
- [ ] Check mechanics/ duplicates, keep best version
- [ ] Check status/ duplicates, keep current version
- [ ] Delete 11 `desktop.ini` files (Windows artifacts)

### Optional - Reorganization

See `CLEANUP_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` for proposed folder restructure:
- Consolidate 14 folders → 7 organized folders
- Move files to logical locations
- Create folder-level README files

---

## CURRENT STATE

**Total Documents**: ~50 files
**Naming Status**:
- ✅ 3 new .md files: Correct names
- ✅ 30+ .md files: Don't reference city (no update needed)
- ❌ 13 .gdoc files: Need manual updates

**Organization Status**:
- ✅ Master README created
- ✅ All action plans documented
- ❌ Google Docs still need updates
- ❌ Duplicates still present

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Update .gdoc files** (you must do this in Google Docs)
2. **Delete duplicates** (04_racial_hierarchy.md confirmed)
3. **Optional**: Reorganize folders per plan
4. **Optional**: Create folder-level README files

---

## FILES YOU CAN DELETE NOW

**Confirmed Safe to Delete**:
- `social_structures/04_racial_hierarchy.md` (duplicate of 01)
- All `desktop.ini` files (11 total - Windows artifacts)

**Check Before Deleting**:
- `mechanics/04_oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc` (compare with oracle_mechanics.md.gdoc first)
- `status/_BUILD_STATUS.md.gdoc` (compare with BUILD_STATUS.md.gdoc first)

---

## SUMMARY

Your worldbuilding is now **organized and documented**:
- ✅ Master README provides overview
- ✅ New files use correct naming (Kitsahl/New Albion)
- ✅ Duplicates identified
- ✅ Clear action items for remaining work

**The foundation is solid**. Once you update the .gdoc files, everything will be consistent and ready for expansion or story writing!

*Total cleanup time: ~30 minutes of work remaining (manual .gdoc updates)*
