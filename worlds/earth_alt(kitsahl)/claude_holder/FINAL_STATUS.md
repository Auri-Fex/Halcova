### QUICK CLEANUP - ~5 minutes

**Delete confirmed duplicates**:
- [ ] social_structures/04_racial_hierarchy.md (keep 01 version)
- [ ] All desktop.ini files (11 total)

**Compare and consolidate**:
- [ ] mechanics/ - which oracle_mechanics is more complete?
- [ ] status/ - which BUILD_STATUS is current?

## 📊 CURRENT STATISTICS

**Total Files**: ~50
**Status**:
- ✅ 3 new files: Perfect (Kitsahl/New Albion)
- ✅ ~30 .md files: Don't need updates (no city references)
- ❌ 13 .gdoc files: Need manual updates
- ❌ 3 duplicates: Need deletion/consolidation

**Word Count**: ~140,000+ words
**Completion**: ~35-40% of planned worldbuilding

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

### What's Working
- ✅ Core systems fully documented (Oracle, Alchemy, Bureau, Trust)
- ✅ Geography comprehensive (City + Territory + Region)
- ✅ Economics complete (Currency, Class, Prices)
- ✅ Social structures detailed (Race, Gender, Class, Daily Life)
- ✅ Language system built (Sybari with 3 registers)
- ✅ Timeline established (Oracle Wars → Present)

### What's Partially Done
- ⚠️ Naming consistency (3 files done, 13 files remaining)
- ⚠️ File organization (documented but not restructured)
- ⚠️ Duplicates (identified but not removed)

### What's Missing
- ❌ Big Five Oracle Houses (individual profiles)

- ❌ Specific story plots/campaigns
- ❌ Advanced alchemy details
- ❌ Global politics (beyond overview)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Finish Cleanup (Today)
1. Update all .gdoc files with correct names
2. Delete confirmed duplicates
3. Consolidate mechanics/ and status/ files

### Phase 2: Organization (This Week)
4. Decide on folder restructure (keep 14 folders or consolidate to 7?)
5. Create folder-level README files
6. Update any broken cross-references

### Phase 3: Expansion (Ongoing)
7. Develop Big Five Oracle Houses individually
8. Create major NPCs and characters
