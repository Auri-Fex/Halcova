# Racial Hierarchy in the Oracle Age

**Foundation**: European racial supremacy justified by oracle technology

**Key Claim**: "Oracle predictions prove racial hierarchy is natural"

**Reality**: Oracle reflects existing racism; perpetuates it through surveillance

---

## The Hierarchy (1870s Greymouth)

### Top: European (British/Anglo-Saxon)

**Position**: Dominant race; system designed for them

**% Population**: ~60% of Greymouth

**Oracle Narrative**:
- "Low crime probability proves moral superiority"
- "Success in oracle industry proves intellectual capacity"
- "We invented oracle technology" (FALSE - stolen from indigenous)

**Actual Advantages**:
- Bureau under-polices European neighborhoods
- Oracle Houses hire Europeans preferentially
- Education access (Technical Sybari)
- Legal system favors Europeans

---

### Second Tier: Other Europeans (Irish, German, Italian, Eastern European)

**Position**: Discriminated against but assimilable

**% Population**: ~15%

**Prejudice**:
- Irish: "Drunken, violent, criminal"
- Italian: "Mafia, organized crime"
- Eastern European: "Backwards, superstitious"

**Oracle Justification**:
- Higher crime probability (Bureau surveils these neighborhoods more)
- "Cultural deficiencies" blamed for oracle predictions

**Path to Acceptance**:
- Assimilation (speak Common, adopt Anglo-Saxon norms)
- Second generation "becomes white" (if successful)
- Marry into Anglo-Saxon families

---

### Third Tier: East Asian (Chinese, Japanese)

**Position**: "Perpetual foreigners"

**% Population**: ~8% (mostly Chinese immigrants)

**Prejudice**:
- "Inscrutable, untrustworthy"
- "Take jobs from honest workers"
- "Opium dens, vice"

**Oracle Justification**:
- "Can't integrate oracle technology" (FALSE - Japan adopting rapidly)
- Bureau targets Chinatown heavily

**Legal Restrictions**:
- Exclusion Acts (limit immigration)
- Can't own property in some areas
- Forbidden from some professions

---

### Bottom Tier: Indigenous Peoples

**Position**: Most oppressed; system built on their genocide

**% Population**: ~5-7% (survivors of genocide)

**Prejudice**:
- "Savage, primitive, violent"
- "Lazy, drunken, criminal"
- "Dying race" (eugenics theory)

**Oracle Justification**:
- Highest crime probability (80%+ in Bureau stats)
- "Oracle proves they're naturally criminal"

**Reality**:
- Bureau over-polices indigenous neighborhoods
- Poverty created by dispossession
- Traditional oracle practice criminalized
- **They invented oracle technology** (truth erased)

---

### Outside Hierarchy: Black/African

**Position**: Small population but heavily discriminated

**% Population**: <2% (recent immigration, escaped slaves from Americas)

**Prejudice**:
- All stereotypes from slavery/colonialism
- Oracle "confirms" inferiority (predictably)

**Special Status**: Not numerous enough to be major "threat"; still targeted

---

## How Oracle Technology Reinforces Racism

### Bureau Surveillance Targeting

**"Crime Probability" by Race** (Bureau statistics, 1870s):
- Indigenous: 80% (highest)
- Black: 70%
- Chinese: 60%
- Irish: 55%
- Italian: 50%
- Anglo-Saxon: 15% (lowest)

**What Europeans Claim**: "Oracle objectively shows racial differences in criminality"

**Reality**:
1. Bureau patrols indigenous/immigrant neighborhoods more
2. More patrols = more arrests
3. More arrests = "high crime rate"
4. High crime rate = justifies more patrols
5. **Self-fulfilling prophecy**

**Plus**: Oracle trained on historical data (which reflects centuries of racism)

---

### Oracle House Employment

**Hiring Patterns**:
- **Tier 1 positions** (executives, oracle consultants): 95%+ European
- **Tier 2 positions** (operators, analysts): 85% European, 15% assimilated immigrants
- **Tier 3 positions** (technicians, clerks): 70% European, 25% immigrant, 5% indigenous
- **Tier 4 positions** (maintenance, cleaning): 40% European, 60% immigrant/indigenous

**Justification**: "Oracle predicts who will succeed in role"

**Reality**: Oracle reflects hiring manager's bias

---

### "Scientific Racism" + Oracle Predictions

**Eugenics Movement** (1870s, growing):

**Claims**:
- "Races have innate intellectual differences"
- "Oracle technology proves Anglo-Saxons superior"
- "Indigenous peoples dying out naturally" (ignoring genocide)
- "Breeding programs can improve racial stock"

**Oracle Support**:
- "Predict" which children will be "valuable citizens"
- Sterilization recommendations (for indigenous, disabled, poor)
- Immigration restriction (oracle shows "undesirable races")

**This Is Evil**: Using stolen technology to justify genocide of people who created it

---

## Indigenous Peoples - Special Case

### The Ultimate Irony

**They created oracle technology** (Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali traditions)

**Europeans stole it** (1520s-1650s, torture and genocide)

**Now Europeans claim**:
- "We invented it"
- "Indigenous peoples too primitive to have developed this"
- "Oracle proves they're inferior"

**Using indigenous knowledge to oppress indigenous descendants**

---

### Bureau Targeting

**Indigenous Neighborhoods** (Tidemark, parts of Factory District):
- 80% crime probability (Bureau standard)
- Daily patrols (10+ agents constant presence)
- Precrime arrests common (hundreds annually)
- Curfews (10 PM, violators arrested)

**Indigenous Individuals**:
- Registered (like Sarah Blackwater, 15,000 in Greymouth)
- Weekly check-ins required
- Travel restrictions
- Employment limits (can't work government jobs)

---

### Cultural Criminalization

**Traditional Practices = Crimes**:
- Speaking Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali in public: Arrest
- Practicing traditional oracle rituals: Arrest + execution
- Teaching children indigenous language: Arrest + children removed
- Gathering in groups >5: Suspected conspiracy, arrest

**Result**: Indigenous culture underground or dying

---

## Immigrant Communities

### Chinese (Largest Non-European Group)

**Why They Came**: Railroad work, mining, labor

**Where They Live**: Chinatown (part of Tidemark, separate enclave)

**Bureau Treatment**:
- High surveillance (opium den raids)
- "Tong" suspected (organized crime)
- Routine harassment

**Community Response**:
- Mutual aid societies (tongs, benevolent associations)
- Separate economy (Chinese-owned businesses)
- Some oracle access (community pooling money for devices)

**Resistance**: Economic success despite discrimination; maintain cultural identity

---

### Irish (Largest European Immigrant Group)

**Why They Came**: Famine, poverty, seeking work

**Where They Live**: Scattered (Factory District, Tangles)

**Bureau Treatment**:
- Moderate surveillance ("drunkenness, brawling")
- Labor organizing = heavily monitored

**Assimilation Path**:
- Second generation often passes as "white"
- Lose accent, Irish identity
- Join anti-indigenous racism (prove they're "real" Europeans)

**Complicated**: Oppressed themselves but participate in oppressing others

---

## Racial Mixing (Miscegenation)

### Legal Status

**Technically legal** (no formal ban like some jurisdictions)

**Socially forbidden** (severe consequences):
- European + Non-European = scandal
- Children of mixed race: "Half-breed" (neither community accepts)
- Bureau heightened surveillance (moral corruption)

---

### Indigenous-European

**Patterns**:
- Usually European man + Indigenous woman (power dynamics)
- Often coercive (domestic service, economic desperation)
- Children: Considered indigenous (inherit disadvantage)

**Social Consequence**:
- European man faces minimal consequences (maybe scandal)
- Indigenous woman: Shamed, shunned, blamed
- Children: Discriminated by both groups

---

### Chinese-European

**Rare** (social taboo even stronger)
- Legal restrictions (Chinese Exclusion Acts limit family formation)
- When happens: Severe ostracism

---

## Racial Violence

### Mob Violence

**Patterns**:
- Indigenous peoples most targeted
- Chinese community scapegoated (economic downturns)
- Irish vs. Indigenous conflicts (compete for Tier 4 jobs)

**Bureau Response**:
- Minimal protection for non-European victims
- Blame victims ("their presence provoked it")
- Oracle predicts violence but doesn't prevent (convenient)

**Example - Tidemark Riot (1869)**:
- Economic panic → European mob attacks indigenous neighborhood
- 47 indigenous people killed
- Bureau: "Oracle showed high violence probability" (blame victims)
- No arrests of rioters

---

### Institutional Violence

**Bureau Brutality**:
- Indigenous suspects: Beaten during arrest (routine)
- Chinese suspects: "Opium addict" assumed (rough treatment)
- European suspects: "Innocent until proven guilty" (gentle handling)

**Death Penalty**:
- Disproportionately applied to non-Europeans
- "Oracle showed recidivism probability" (justification)

---

## Resistance

### Indigenous Resistance

**Armed Resistance** (declining by 1870s):
- Lakota, Cheyenne, others still fighting (western territories)
- Urban indigenous: Occasional riots, uprisings

**Cultural Resistance**:
- Underground language preservation
- Secret oracle practice (traditional methods)
- Oral histories (remember the theft)

**Political Resistance**:
- Rare indigenous activists speak truth publicly (usually arrested)
- Underground publications
- Building alliances with other oppressed groups

---

### Immigrant Resistance

**Chinese**:
- Economic self-sufficiency (reduce dependence on European economy)
- Tongs (mutual protection, though also criminal elements)
- Maintain culture despite pressure

**Irish**:
- Labor organizing (unions, strikes)
- Political machines (voting blocs)
- Path: Often involves participating in anti-indigenous racism (tragic)

---

### Cross-Racial Solidarity (Rare But Real)

**Examples**:
- Indigenous-Chinese alliance (Tidemark, shared neighborhood)
- Interracial labor unions (some socialists organize across race)
- Underground networks (hiding fugitives, sharing resources)

**Challenges**:
- Bureau infiltrates (predictions identify organizers)
- Racism among oppressed groups (Irish vs. indigenous)
- Economic competition (Tier 4 jobs scarce)

---

## The Racist Ideology

### "Oracle Proves Hierarchy Natural"

**The Argument**:
1. Oracle is objective (machine doesn't lie)
2. Oracle shows Europeans succeed more
3. Oracle shows non-Europeans commit more crime
4. Therefore: Racial hierarchy is natural, not social

**The Flaw**:
1. Oracle reflects bias in data (trained on racist history)
2. Bureau over-polices non-Europeans (creates crime statistics)
3. Europeans control oracle access (advantage = wealth = success)
4. Therefore: Oracle perpetuates racism, doesn't prove it

---

### "White Man's Burden" (Oracle Edition)

**Colonialism Justified**:
- "Indigenous peoples had crude oracle superstitions"
- "We developed it scientifically"
- "We have duty to civilize them"

**Reality**:
- Indigenous peoples created sophisticated oracle traditions
- Europeans stole knowledge through torture
- "Civilization" = genocide + cultural erasure

---

## The Truth

**Racial hierarchy is constructed** (not natural):
- Oracle technology weaponized to justify racism
- Surveillance targets non-Europeans systematically
- "Crime statistics" are self-fulfilling prophecies
- Indigenous peoples invented what Europeans claim as theirs

**Every prediction is political**:
- High crime probability for indigenous = Bureau decides to target them
- Low crime probability for Europeans = Bureau decides not to police them
- System designed to confirm racist assumptions

**Resistance exists**:
- Indigenous peoples preserve knowledge underground
- Immigrants build mutual aid
- Some Europeans ally (rare but real)
