# Indigenous Peoples in the Oracle Age

**Population** (1870s): ~5-7% of Greymouth (~50,000-70,000)

**Status**: Most oppressed group; victims of ongoing genocide

**Ultimate Irony**: They created oracle technology; Europeans stole it; now Europeans use it to oppress them

---

## Surviving Groups (1870s Greymouth Region)

### Coastal Peoples (Largest Group)

**Origin**: Descended from Tav'mora speakers (coastal maritime oracle traditions)

**Pre-Contact**: ~500,000 in region
**1870s**: ~30,000 survivors (94% population loss)

**Traditional Lands**: Now Greymouth harbor, Tidemark, coastal areas
**Current Status**: Dispossessed; confined to urban slums or reservations

**Oracle Tradition**: Tide prophecy, weather prediction, nautical forecasting
**European Appropriation**: Stolen 1520s-1650s; now basis for maritime oracle applications

---

### Mountain Peoples (Smallest Urban Group)

**Origin**: Descended from Shen'kali speakers (crystal-singing traditions)

**Pre-Contact**: ~200,000 in mountain regions
**1870s**: ~8,000 survivors (96% loss)

**Traditional Lands**: Mountains now strip-mined for oracle crystals
**Current Status**: Remote mountain communities or urban refugees

**Oracle Tradition**: Crystal resonance, sacred site prophecy
**European Appropriation**: Crystals seized; sacred mountains desecrated; knowledge stolen

---

### Forest Peoples (Underground)

**Origin**: Descended from Kael'nir speakers (oracle-keeper clans)

**Pre-Contact**: ~300,000 in northern forests
**1870s**: ~15,000 survivors (95% loss); many in hiding

**Traditional Lands**: Forests logged for timber and development
**Current Status**: Deep forest holdouts; urban diaspora

**Oracle Tradition**: Complex evidential system (16 markers), spiritual prophecy
**European Appropriation**: Torture-extracted knowledge became Technical Sybari; evidential system stolen and simplified

---

## Demographics

### Age Distribution (Skewed)

**Children** (0-15): 45% (high birth rate but high infant mortality)
**Adults** (16-50): 50% (prime working age)
**Elderly** (50+): 5% (low life expectancy - average 35-40 years)

**Comparison to Europeans**:
- European life expectancy: 50-55 years
- Indigenous: 35-40 years
- **Difference**: Poverty, violence, lack of medical care

---

### Gender Ratio (Imbalanced)

**Women**: 55%
**Men**: 45%

**Causes**:
- Men disproportionately killed (resistance, Bureau violence)
- Men imprisoned at higher rates
- Dangerous labor (mining, logging)

**Effect**: Many women widowed or never marry

---

### Urban vs. Rural

**Urban** (Greymouth): ~40,000 (80% of regional indigenous)
**Rural** (Reservations, remote): ~10,000 (20%)

**Urban Pattern**: Concentrated in Tidemark (majority), Factory District, Tangles
**Spatial Segregation**: De facto (economic) and de jure (rental discrimination)

---

## Economic Position

### Tier Distribution

**Tier 1-2**: <1% (virtually none)
**Tier 3**: ~5% (rare success stories)
**Tier 4**: ~35% (stable employment)
**Tier 5**: ~60% (majority - poor, unemployed, criminalized)

**Employment Barriers**:
- Discrimination (employers prefer Europeans)
- Bureau surveillance (criminal records)
- Language (Technical Sybari required for oracle jobs; many don't speak it)
- Education (limited access)

---

### Occupations

**Common Jobs** (Tier 4):
- Domestic service (40% of employed indigenous women)
- Factory work (unskilled, lowest-paid)
- Dockwork (dangerous, irregular)
- Laundry, cleaning
- Street vending (informal economy)

**Rare Professions** (Tier 3):
- Skilled trades (if apprenticeship obtained)
- Shopkeepers (small businesses in indigenous neighborhoods)
- Teachers (for indigenous children, poorly paid)

**Unemployment** (Tier 5):
- Seasonal (40% unemployed part of year)
- Chronic (20% never employed)
- Underground economy (survival strategies)

---

### Income

**Average**: £25-35/year (vs. £150 European average)

**Working Poor** (Tier 4): £30-50/year
- Barely covers rent, food
- No savings
- Constant debt

**Destitute** (Tier 5): <£20/year
- Homeless or shared slum rooms
- Charity, begging, theft
- Malnutrition common

---

## Bureau Surveillance & Targeting

### "Crime Probability" Statistics

**Bureau Data** (1870s):
- Indigenous neighborhoods: 80% crime probability
- Indigenous individuals registered: 75% recidivism probability
- Indigenous children: 60% "future criminal" probability

**What Bureau Claims**: "Objective oracle predictions show indigenous criminality"

**Reality**:
1. Bureau over-patrols indigenous areas (10x patrol density vs. European)
2. More patrols = more arrests
3. More arrests = higher "crime rate"
4. Higher crime rate = justifies more patrols
5. **Self-fulfilling prophecy**

---

### Precrime Arrests

**Indigenous People** (1870s Greymouth):
- ~500 precrime arrests annually
- 80% indigenous (despite being 7% of population)
- Average detention: 6 months (no trial)
- Charge: "High probability future violence"

**Example - Jacob Stormfeather**:
- Factory worker, age 28
- Arrested for "80% probability theft within 3 days"
- Evidence: Oracle prediction + indigenous + poor neighborhood
- Detained 6 months
- Never committed crime
- Lost job; fell to Tier 5 after release

---

### The Registry

**"High-Risk Individual Registry"** (Bureau):
- ~15,000 registered in Greymouth
- 70% indigenous (10,500 people)
- Requirements: Weekly check-ins, travel restrictions, employment limits

**How People Get Registered**:
- Any arrest (even if charges dropped)
- "Suspicious behavior" (Bureau discretion)
- Living in "high-crime area" (Tidemark)
- **Being indigenous** (sometimes sufficient alone)

**Effects**:
- Can't leave city without permission
- Can't work government jobs
- Subject to random searches
- Employers won't hire registered individuals

---

## Cultural Suppression

### Language Criminalization

**Forbidden** (Death penalty if caught):
- Speaking Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali in public
- Teaching children traditional languages
- Publishing in indigenous languages
- Using traditional evidential markers (16-marker system)

**Enforcement**:
- Bureau monitors public spaces
- Informants paid to report
- Children removed from families if parents teach language
- ~50 executions annually for "linguistic corruption"

---

### Oracle Practice Criminalization

**Traditional Oracle Rituals** = Capital Offense:
- Crystal-singing (Shen'kali tradition)
- Tide prophecy ceremonies (Tav'mora)
- Vision quests (Kael'nir)
- **Using oracles "incorrectly"** (spiritual vs. mechanical)

**Enforcement**:
- Bureau raids suspected gatherings
- Torture to extract names of other practitioners
- Public executions (deterrence)
- ~20-30 executions annually for "unauthorized oracle practice"

---

### Sacred Site Desecration

**Status of Sacred Places** (1870s):

**Coastal Sites** (Tav'mora):
- Now Greymouth harbor (developed)
- Tide pools destroyed (dock construction)
- Ceremonial beaches private property

**Mountain Sites** (Shen'kali):
- Strip-mined for oracle crystals
- Sacred peaks blasted (ore extraction)
- Crystal caves collapsed
- No indigenous access (mining company property)

**Forest Groves** (Kael'nir):
- Logged for timber
- Oracle training sites destroyed
- Surviving groves hidden (remote locations)

**When Indigenous Peoples Try to Visit**:
- Arrested for trespassing
- Shot by mine security
- Bureau predicts "property crime"; prevents access

---

## Resistance

### Armed Resistance (Declining)

**Historical** (1520s-1850s):
- Oracle Wars (1580-1650): 70-year conflict
- Guerrilla warfare (1650-1780s): Sporadic but widespread
- Final uprisings (1780-1850s): Crushed by oracle-guided military

**Current** (1870s):
- Western territories: Some nations still fighting (Lakota, Cheyenne, Apache)
- Greymouth region: Armed resistance mostly ended
- Occasional riots (Tidemark, 1869)

**Why Declining**:
- Military disparity (Europeans have superior weapons + oracle predictions)
- Population loss (genocide reduced numbers)
- Spatial confinement (reservations, urban slums - hard to organize)
- Bureau precrime arrests (predictions identify resistance before it starts)

---

### Cultural Resistance

**Underground Language Preservation**:
- Secret schools (teach Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali)
- Oral histories passed down (remember the theft)
- Hidden written records (buried, sealed in walls)
- **Risk**: Discovery = execution

**Traditional Oracle Practice** (Illegal):
- Late night rituals (hidden locations)
- Crystal-singing in caves (far from Bureau)
- Vision quests (remote wilderness)
- ~1,000-2,000 still practice (secret)
- **Risk**: Discovery = death penalty

**Memory Keeping**:
- Elders remember names of tortured oracle-keepers
- Stories of sacred sites before desecration
- Record of stolen knowledge (Europeans took X from us)
- Teaching children: "Never forget what they did"

---

### Political Resistance

**Public Activism** (Rare, Dangerous):
- Speaking truth in public ("Europeans stole oracle technology from us")
- Publishing pamphlets (quickly banned)
- Testifying in court (dismissed as "unreliable")
- Interrupting museum exhibits (arrested)

**Example - Walking Crow** (1871):
- Spoke at public square about theft
- Arrested within 10 minutes
- Charged: "Seditious speech" + "Linguistic corruption"
- Executed publicly (1872)
- **Legacy**: Some Europeans heard; began questioning

**Underground Publications**:
- "The Memory" (illegal newspaper, irregular publication)
- Oral transmission (stories, songs)
- Graffiti ("Oracle = Stolen Knowledge")

---

### Economic Resistance

**Mutual Aid Networks**:
- Share resources (food, housing, money)
- Underground economy (barter, informal work)
- Survival strategies (collective childcare, shared housing)

**Boycotts**:
- Refuse to work for Oracle Houses (when possible)
- Avoid Bureau cooperation (don't inform)
- Support indigenous-owned businesses

**Sabotage** (Covert):
- Crystal miners damaging equipment
- Factory workers inserting defects (oracle devices)
- Domestic servants "accidentally" breaking employer's oracles
- **Risk**: If caught, death penalty

---

## Survival Strategies

### Assimilation (Painful Choice)

**What It Means**:
- Adopt European names (hide indigenous identity)
- Speak only Common/Sybari (abandon traditional language)
- Practice Christianity (abandon traditional spirituality)
- Marry Europeans (children "become white")

**Benefits**:
- Less Bureau surveillance (if pass as European)
- Better employment (if hide identity)
- Children have easier lives

**Costs**:
- Cultural death (lose identity)
- Community rejection (seen as traitors)
- Self-hatred (internalized racism)
- **Never fully accepted** (Europeans still discriminate)

**Who Chooses This**: Some Tier 3 indigenous (economic pressure)

---

### Dual Identity (Dangerous Balance)

**What It Means**:
- European identity in public (work, Bureau interactions)
- Indigenous identity in private (home, community)
- Code-switching (language, behavior, dress)

**Benefits**:
- Maintain culture while surviving economically
- Community connections preserved

**Costs**:
- Constant performance (exhausting)
- Risk of exposure (Bureau surveillance)
- Psychological toll (living double life)

**Who Chooses This**: Many Tier 4 indigenous (majority strategy)

---

### Resistance Identity (Principled Stance)

**What It Means**:
- Refuse assimilation (maintain indigenous identity openly)
- Practice traditional language/culture (despite risk)
- Political activism (speak truth publicly)

**Benefits**:
- Cultural preservation (keep traditions alive)
- Community respect (honored as resisters)
- Moral integrity (refuse collaboration)

**Costs**:
- Bureau targeting (constant surveillance)
- Economic exclusion (can't get jobs)
- High risk of arrest/execution
- Live in Tier 5 poverty

**Who Chooses This**: Elders, activists, traditionalists (~10-20%)

---

## Intergenerational Trauma

### First Generation (Survived Genocide)

**Experienced**:
- Witnessed family massacres
- Survived torture (for oracle knowledge)
- Saw sacred sites destroyed
- Lost traditional lands

**Effects**:
- PTSD (nightmares, flashbacks)
- Grief (entire communities gone)
- Rage (desire for vengeance)
- **Determination**: Preserve what remains

---

### Second Generation (1840s-1860s births)

**Experienced**:
- Heard parents' stories (trauma transmitted)
- Some remember pre-confinement life
- Witnessed ongoing suppression
- Saw culture criminalized

**Effects**:
- Anger + hopelessness (system seems eternal)
- Some assimilate (survival)
- Some resist (honor ancestors)
- **Question**: Is resistance futile?

---

### Third Generation (1860s-1880s births)

**Experiencing** (children in 1870s):
- Born into reservation/urban slum
- Never knew traditional life
- Bureau surveillance normal
- Some don't know indigenous origins

**Effects**:
- Identity confusion (what does being indigenous mean?)
- Some reject indigenous identity (internalized racism)
- Some reclaim culture (learn from elders)
- **The Risk**: Cultural memory fading

---

## Community Structure

### Traditional Governance (Suppressed)

**Pre-Contact**:
- Council of elders (decision-making)
- Oracle-keepers (spiritual leadership)
- Chiefs/leaders (political)
- Clan structure (kinship-based)

**Current**:
- Illegal (Europeans don't recognize indigenous governance)
- Underground councils (secret meetings)
- Elders respected (but no formal power)

---

### Urban Community (1870s)

**Tidemark Indigenous Neighborhood**:
- ~30,000 indigenous residents
- Informal networks (mutual aid, information-sharing)
- Underground leadership (respected elders, activists)
- **Bureau surveillance**: Constant

**Community Functions**:
- Share food, housing (survival)
- Teach children (secret schools)
- Preserve language/culture (hidden rituals)
- Organize resistance (carefully)

---

### Reservation Communities

**Status** (1870s):
- ~10,000 indigenous on reservations (remote lands)
- Poor quality land (Europeans took best)
- Bureau oversight (reservation agents)
- Ration system (dependency)

**Advantages**:
- Less surveillance than urban (remote)
- Easier to practice traditions (fewer Europeans)
- Community cohesion (isolated together)

**Disadvantages**:
- Extreme poverty (no economic opportunities)
- Food scarcity (rations insufficient)
- Medical care absent (high mortality)
- Geographic isolation (cut off from resistance networks)

---

## The Prophecy (Indigenous Belief)

### Vision of the Future

**Traditional Oracle-Keepers** (underground):
- Some still practice long-range prophecy
- Vision: "One day the truth will be undeniable"
- Prediction: "Europeans will remember what they did"
- Hope: "Justice will come, though we may not live to see it"

**Certainty Level**: Low (long-range prophecy uncertain)

**Function**: Not accurate prediction, but **moral sustenance**
- Gives meaning to suffering
- Justifies resistance
- Provides hope

---

### The Reckoning

**Indigenous Belief**:
"They stole our knowledge. They used it against us. They tried to erase us. But we survive. We remember. And one day - maybe not in our lifetime, maybe not in our children's, but one day - there will be a reckoning. The truth will be known. Justice will be done."

**European Dismissal**: "Primitive superstition"

**Reality**: History moves in unpredictable ways. Who knows?

---

## The Ultimate Irony

**Indigenous peoples created oracle technology**:
- Sophisticated spiritual practices (thousands of years)
- Complex evidential systems (16 markers)
- Deep philosophical understanding (time, knowledge, ethics)

**Europeans stole it**:
- Torture (1520s-1650s)
- Genocide (ongoing)
- Cultural appropriation (claimed as European invention)

**Now Europeans use stolen technology to oppress indigenous descendants**:
- Bureau surveillance (prophetic policing)
- Precrime arrests (based on "criminal probability")
- Justification of genocide ("oracle shows they're inferior")

**Every oracle prediction against indigenous peoples is using their own knowledge as weapon**
