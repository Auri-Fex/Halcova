# Resistance Movements

**Central Problem**: How do you resist when oracles predict resistance?

**Bureau Advantage**: Precrime arrests stop organizing before it starts

**But**: Resistance persists; adapts; finds ways to evade prophecy

---

## The Prophetic Problem

### Traditional Resistance

**How Revolutions Usually Work**:
1. Secret organizing (build movement)
2. Strategic planning (choose moment)
3. Surprise action (catch authorities off-guard)
4. Momentum (spread before suppression)

---

### Oracle-Age Complication

**How Bureau Disrupts**:
1. Oracle predicts "75% probability labor unrest in 2 weeks"
2. Bureau increases patrols, arrests organizers
3. Movement crushed before action
4. **Revolution prevented**

**The Question**: How to organize when they see you coming?

---

## Resistance Strategies

### 1. Spontaneity (Evade Forecast Window)

**Logic**: Oracles predict 1-30 days ahead; act immediately

**Example - Wildcat Strikes**:
- Workers decide to strike **today** (no advance planning)
- Oracle can't predict (outside useful window)
- Bureau scrambles to respond (no preparation)

**Limitations**:
- Hard to coordinate (no planning time)
- Often fails (unprepared)
- Can't sustain (immediate response only)

**Success Rate**: ~30% achieve short-term goals

---

### 2. Decentralization (Confuse Predictions)

**Logic**: Oracles predict based on patterns; make resistance formless

**Example - Cell Structure**:
- No central leadership (nothing to predict)
- Independent cells (don't know each other)
- Simultaneous actions (oracles can't predict all)

**Limitations**:
- Coordination difficult
- Easy to infiltrate cells
- Limited strategic vision

**Success Rate**: ~40% evade immediate arrest

---

### 3. Counter-Prophecy (Underground Oracles)

**Logic**: Use oracles to predict Bureau moves

**Example - Indigenous Resistance**:
- Underground oracle-keepers practice traditional methods
- Predict Bureau raids (escape before arrest)
- Forecast oracle predictions (plan around them)

**Advantages**:
- Level playing field (both sides use oracles)
- Traditional methods sometimes more accurate (spiritual dimension)

**Limitations**:
- Illegal (death penalty)
- Limited oracle access (no devices; only traditional methods)
- Bureau has superior resources

**Success Rate**: ~50% evade capture (when practiced)

---

### 4. Overwhelm (Too Many Targets)

**Logic**: Oracles limited capacity; if everyone resists, can't stop all

**Example - General Strike**:
- Entire working class stops work (simultaneously)
- Bureau can't arrest everyone (jails full)
- Economy halts (forces concessions)

**Limitations**:
- Hard to organize (requires mass coordination)
- Oracle predicts if organizing visible
- Starvation risk (workers have no savings)

**Success Rate**: Rare (only 2-3 successful general strikes in 1870s; brutal suppression)

---

## Major Movements (1870s)

### Labor Movement (Largest)

**Participants**: Tier 4 workers (~400,000 in Greymouth)

**Goals**:
- 8-hour workday (currently 12-14 hours)
- Higher wages
- Safe conditions
- Right to organize (unions currently tolerated but restricted)

**Tactics**:
- Strikes (work stoppages)
- Sabotage (damage equipment)
- Boycotts (refuse to buy)
- Political organizing (vote for sympathetic candidates)

**Bureau Response**:
- Oracle predicts strikes (arrests leaders preventatively)
- Precrime detention (conspiracy charges)
- Strikebreakers (hire replacements)
- Violence (police/military break strikes)

**Success**: Mixed (~30% of strikes achieve some goals)

---

**Example Organizations**:

**Greymouth Workers Union** (1868):
- ~15,000 members (factory workers, dockers)
- Organizes strikes, mutual aid
- Bureau: Heavy surveillance; ~200 arrests annually for "conspiracy"

**Oracle Operators Guild** (1868):
- ~2,000 members (Tier 3 oracle workers)
- Professional association + union
- Better positioned (skilled labor; harder to replace)
- Bureau: Moderate surveillance

---

### Suffrage Movement (Growing)

**Participants**: Women across tiers (Tier 2-3 leadership; broader base)

**Goals**:
- Voting rights (women can't vote)
- Property rights (husbands control)
- Educational access (universities mostly male)
- Professional equality

**Tactics**:
- Public demonstrations (marches, rallies)
- Civil disobedience (refuse to obey unjust laws)
- Publications (newspapers, pamphlets)
- Political pressure (lobby sympathetic men)

**Bureau Response**:
- Oracle predicts demonstrations (pre-emptive arrests)
- Morality charges ("disorderly conduct")
- Institutionalization ("hysteria" diagnosis for leaders)

**Success**: Slow but steady (~10% progress toward goals in 1870s)

---

**Example Organizations**:

**Greymouth Women's Suffrage Association** (1872):
- ~5,000 members
- Tier 2 leadership (professional women, wives of wealthy)
- Respectable tactics (legal advocacy)

**Radical Women's Alliance** (1871):
- ~1,000 members
- Tier 3-4 base (working women)
- Militant tactics (property destruction, strikes)
- Bureau: Heavy suppression

---

### Indigenous Resistance (Most Oppressed, Most Militant)

**Participants**: ~50,000-70,000 indigenous peoples (Greymouth region)

**Goals**:
- Land return (traditional territories)
- Cultural rights (language, oracle practice)
- Political sovereignty (self-governance)
- Acknowledgment (Europeans stole oracle technology)

**Tactics**:
- Cultural preservation (underground language/oracle practice)
- Political activism (public truth-telling)
- Armed resistance (rare in urban areas; ongoing in western territories)
- Sabotage (damage oracle industry)

**Bureau Response**:
- Maximum surveillance (80% crime probability)
- Mass arrests (precrime detention)
- Executions (traditional oracle practice = death penalty)
- Military force (western territories)

**Success**: Cultural survival (~20% preserve traditional knowledge); political gains minimal

---

**Example Organizations**:

**The Memory Keepers** (underground):
- ~1,000-2,000 members
- Preserve oral histories, traditional oracle practice
- Teach next generation
- If discovered: Execution

**Speaking Truth Movement** (1860s-1870s):
- Public activists
- Testify to theft ("Europeans stole oracle technology from us")
- Usually arrested within hours
- High mortality (executions common)

---

### Socialist Movement (Emerging)

**Participants**: Intellectuals (Tier 2-3) + workers (Tier 4)

**Goals**:
- Workers own means of production
- Abolish class system
- Common ownership of oracle technology

**Tactics**:
- Education (study groups, publications)
- Labor organizing (ally with unions)
- Political candidates (vote for change)

**Bureau Response**:
- "Dangerous radicals" (heavy surveillance)
- Precrime arrests ("conspiracy to overthrow government")
- Deportation (foreign-born socialists expelled)

**Success**: Growing influence (~5,000 active socialists in Greymouth)

---

**Example Organizations**:

**Greymouth Socialist League** (1875):
- ~3,000 members
- Intellectual leadership + working-class base
- Publishes "The People's Oracle" (newspaper)
- Bureau: Constant harassment

---

### Abolitionist Movement (Oracle Slavery)

**Goals**:
- End precrime detention (arrest only after crime)
- Restrict Bureau surveillance
- Dismantle Oracle Houses monopoly
- Reparations for indigenous peoples

**Participants**: Small but growing (Tier 2-3 reformers)

**Tactics**:
- Legal challenges (court cases)
- Public education (expose Bureau abuses)
- Electoral politics (reform candidates)

**Bureau Response**:
- Moderate (reformers are respectable Tier 2-3)
- Surveillance but few arrests
- Political pressure (Oracle Houses lobby against)

**Success**: Minimal (~1-2 legal victories; no structural change)

---

## Cross-Movement Solidarity (Rare)

### The Intersectional Challenge

**Problem**: Different oppressions; different priorities

**Labor**: Focus on class (sometimes ignore race/gender)
**Suffrage**: Focus on gender (often Tier 2-3 only; ignore working women)
**Indigenous**: Focus on colonial theft (often isolated)
**Socialist**: Focus on capitalism (theory sometimes disconnected from lived experience)

---

### Successful Alliances (When They Happen)

**Example - Tidemark Mutual Aid Network** (1873):
- Indigenous + Chinese + Irish working-class
- Share resources (food, housing, childcare)
- Collective resistance (protect from Bureau raids)
- **Success**: Survival; community cohesion

**Example - Cross-Class Women's Strike** (1876):
- Tier 2 suffragists + Tier 4 factory women
- Demand: Vote AND labor rights
- **Temporary**: Alliance fragile (class tensions remain)

---

### Why Solidarity Is Hard

**Bureau Strategy**: Divide resistance
- Predict alliances forming
- Arrest organizers before meeting
- Infiltrate (agent provocateurs)

**Internal Tensions**:
- Class conflict (Tier 2 reformers vs. Tier 4 radicals)
- Racial prejudice (Irish workers vs. indigenous workers)
- Gender hierarchy (male labor leaders marginalize women)

**But**: When solidarity succeeds, it's powerful

---

## Bureau Counter-Resistance

### Precrime Suppression

**Process**:
1. Oracle predicts "labor unrest probability 70% in 2 weeks"
2. Bureau identifies likely organizers (based on past activity)
3. Arrest organizers for "conspiracy" (before organizing occurs)
4. Hold 6 months (preventative detention)
5. Movement disrupted before formation

**Effect**: Prevents ~60% of planned actions

---

### Infiltration

**Tactics**:
- Bureau agents join movements (undercover)
- Informants recruited (paid or coerced)
- Agent provocateurs (escalate to violence; justify crackdown)

**Detection Difficulty**: Agents selected carefully
- No criminal record (Bureau erases)
- Believable backgrounds (manufactured)
- Genuine commitment performed (build trust)

**When Exposed**: Movement credibility damaged (paranoia spreads)

---

### Violence

**Levels**:

**Legal Violence**:
- Arrests (forceful, often brutal)
- Imprisonment (harsh conditions)
- Executions (for serious offenses)

**Extra-Legal Violence**:
- Bureau "accidents" (prisoners die mysteriously)
- Hired thugs (break strikes, attack activists)
- Mob violence (Bureau allows, sometimes encourages)

**Effect**: Terror (many too afraid to resist)

---

## Why Resistance Persists

### Despite Oracle Predictions

**Reasons**:

**1. Desperation**: "We're dying anyway; might as well fight"

**2. Moral Imperative**: "This system is evil; we must resist regardless of outcome"

**3. Strategic Adaptation**: "We find ways to evade oracles"

**4. Hope**: "Maybe this time we'll succeed"

**5. Solidarity**: "We're not alone; together we're stronger"

---

### Because Prophecy Isn't Perfect

**Oracle Limitations**:
- 60-65% accuracy (35-40% predictions fail)
- Short-term only (can't predict beyond ~30 days)
- Self-negating prophecy (hearing prediction changes behavior)
- Collective action confuses oracles (too many variables)

**Resistance Exploits**:
- Act in 35% unpredicted space
- Long-term planning (beyond oracle window)
- Change plans after prediction (negation)
- Mass movements (overwhelm predictions)

---

## The Long Game

### Short-Term (1870s)

**Reality**: Bureau usually wins
- Most strikes suppressed
- Most organizers arrested
- Little structural change

**But**: Small victories accumulate
- Some strikes succeed
- Consciousness raised
- Networks built

---

### Long-Term (Beyond 1870s)

**Historical Pattern**: All oppressive systems eventually fall

**Oracle Problem**: Can prophecy delay inevitable?

**Resistance Belief**: "No. You can predict revolution coming, but if enough people want change, predictions can't stop it. They'll just see their own defeat approaching."

**The Question**: Are they right?

---

## The Truth

**Resistance is dangerous**:
- High arrest risk
- Precrime detention
- Violence, death

**Resistance is necessary**:
- System won't reform itself
- Oppression won't end without pressure
- Moral imperative to fight injustice

**Resistance is happening**:
- Labor organizing
- Suffrage activism
- Indigenous cultural preservation
- Socialist education
- Cross-movement solidarity

**Prophecy complicates but doesn't stop resistance**:
- Bureau sees it coming
- But resistance adapts
- Finds ways to evade
- Persists despite suppression

**The future is uncertain** (even with oracles):
- Will resistance succeed?
- Will system crush it?
- Will prophecy technology itself be overthrown?

**No oracle can answer definitively** (too many variables; too far in future; collective action unpredictable)

**So the struggle continues**
