# BOOK 1: THE LEDGER
## Chapter 4

*Ashcroft | Fourth Ward Apartment, Fehn | Dawn, April 1862*

The envelope appeared under Ashcroft's door sometime between midnight and dawn.

She found it when she woke—just a pale rectangle on the dark wood floor, visible in the weak morning light filtering through the gap in her curtains. For a moment she stared at it from her bed, still half-asleep, trying to make sense of an envelope that hadn't been there when she'd gone to sleep six hours ago.

Someone had been at her door. In the night. While she slept.

The thought made her pulse jump. She could feel it in her throat as she sat up, bare feet finding the cold floor. The room was small—just enough space for a bed, a desk, a chair, the printing press components she kept hidden under loose floorboards. Rented rooms in the fourth ward were cheap because they were tiny and the walls were thin and you could hear your neighbors arguing or coupling or crying through the plaster.

But thin walls meant you could also hear footsteps in the hallway. Someone approaching your door.

She hadn't heard anything.

Ashcroft crossed the room in three steps, picked up the envelope. Heavy paper, good quality. Not the cheap stuff you could buy at any market stall. No return address. No name. Just sealed with plain wax—not stamped with any mark or seal, just melted wax pressed smooth.

Anonymous.

Her hands weren't quite steady as she broke the seal. The wax crumbled, bits of it falling to the floor like dark red snow. Inside: papers. Three sheets, folded carefully. She pulled them out, carried them to the desk where the morning light was stronger.

Oracle House internal memos.

She recognized the format immediately—she'd seen enough leaked documents over the past two years running the underground press to know what official House correspondence looked like. The letterhead, the formal language, the reference numbers in the upper right corner. These were genuine or very good forgeries.

Her pulse was racing now. She sat in the chair—old wood that creaked under her weight, the seat cushion thin from years of use—and read.

The first memo was dated six months ago. Discussion of "oracle production irregularities" and "attribution concerns." Bureaucratic language that meant something was wrong with how oracles were being made or who was getting credit for making them. The second memo referenced "Vethara contribution" and "origin suppression protocols."

The third memo was more direct: "Maintain proprietary appearance. Source attribution remains House exclusive."

Ashcroft read them twice. Then a third time, her mind working through what they implied. Oracle House was hiding something about how oracles were made. Suppressing information about Vethara involvement. Maintaining exclusive attribution when the work wasn't exclusively theirs.

Theft. Intellectual theft. Taking credit for work that belonged to someone else.

She stood, paced the small room. Three steps to the wall, turn, three steps back. The floorboards creaked under her feet—she'd learned which ones made noise, usually avoided them out of habit, but right now she didn't care. Her mind was racing faster than her feet.

This was big. Bigger than the petty corruption stories she usually published in the underground press. Bigger than minor fraud or small-scale graft. This was systematic appropriation of knowledge, an entire industry built on hidden foundations.

But who had sent it?

She returned to the desk, examined the envelope again. Heavy paper, good quality—expensive. Not something a low-level clerk would have access to. The wax seal was plain, no identifying marks. Whoever sent this knew enough to be careful, knew not to leave traces.

Someone inside Oracle House. Had to be. The memos were internal documents, the kind that didn't leave the building through official channels. Someone had access to files, to archives, to the paper trail that documented decisions most people never saw.

Someone who wanted this information public.

Ashcroft's desk was cluttered with the detritus of journalism—notes from other stories, half-written articles, the portable type she used for the press hidden under the floorboards. She cleared a space, laid the three memos out in a row. Stared at them in the growing morning light.

Genuine. She was almost certain. The paper quality, the formatting, the specific bureaucratic language that was hard to fake unless you'd spent time inside House administration. The reference numbers in the corners would correspond to actual filing systems if anyone could access those systems to verify.

Which she couldn't. Underground press meant operating outside official channels, meant no access to archives or verification systems. She had to rely on instinct, on pattern recognition developed from two years of handling leaked documents.

These felt real.

But "felt real" wasn't the same as "verified." She needed to be sure before publishing anything. Needed to protect her source—whoever they were—by making certain the story was solid before it went public.

Because publishing this would paint a target on both of them. The Houses didn't take kindly to exposure, especially about their core industries. Oracle production was lucrative, prestigious, central to colonial infrastructure. Revealing that they'd stolen knowledge, suppressed attribution, built an empire on appropriated work—that would have consequences.

For her. For her source.

She looked at the envelope again, turned it over in her hands. No identifying marks. No handwriting to analyze. Just expensive paper and plain wax and documents that could destroy careers if they proved true.

*Whoever you are*, she thought, *you're risking everything.*

She knew what that meant. Had seen what happened to people who leaked sensitive information, who threatened House interests. Fired was the best outcome. Imprisoned was common. Disappeared was possible. The Houses maintained order through economic power mostly, but they had other tools when economic pressure wasn't enough.

Tools that left bodies in rivers or explained away deaths as accidents or suicides.

Her source—whoever they were—knew that risk. Had weighed it against whatever moral calculation made them willing to leak these documents. Had chosen to slip an envelope under a journalist's door in the dead of night rather than stay silent.

Ashcroft felt the weight of that decision settle in her chest. Responsibility. Someone had trusted her with this. Trusted her to verify it, to publish it, to protect their identity even if that meant going to prison herself.

She'd made that promise before. To other sources, other leakers, other people who'd decided truth mattered more than safety. Had kept that promise even when authorities came asking questions, even when keeping silent meant legal consequences.

Would keep it now.

She folded the memos carefully, slid them back into the envelope. Her hands were steadier now, purpose overriding nerves. The envelope went into the desk drawer, underneath layers of other papers and notes. Not hidden exactly—she'd need to access it frequently while working the story—but not obviously visible either.

Then she pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and started making notes.

*Oracle House memos - dated 6 months ago - discuss "attribution concerns" and "Kitsahl contribution" - suppression protocols mentioned - need verification*

*Source: anonymous - envelope under door - expensive paper (House employee?) - knows filing systems - taking serious risk*

*Next steps: verify document authenticity - cross-reference with other information - protect source identity - determine publication strategy*

The scratching of her pen against paper was the only sound in the small room. Outside, the fourth ward was waking—she could hear it through the thin walls and cheap window glass. Cart wheels on cobblestones. Someone shouting about fresh bread. The low rumble of a city starting its day, people moving through routines that didn't include thinking about oracle production or intellectual theft or the foundations their comfortable lives were built on.

Most people didn't want to think about that. Preferred not to know. Easier to accept the official story—that the Houses were innovative, that oracles were House inventions, that prosperity came from House genius rather than appropriated knowledge.

But some people did want to know. Did care about truth even when it was uncomfortable. Those were Ashcroft's readers—the small circulation of her underground press, distributed through careful networks, read by people who'd decided that knowing mattered more than comfort.

For them, she'd verify this story. Track down corroborating evidence. Build a case so solid that even the Houses couldn't dismiss it as rumor or slander.

And she'd protect her source. Whoever they were. Whatever their reasons.

Because that's what journalists did. Real journalists, not the ones who printed what the Houses wanted printed and called it news. Real journalism meant taking risks for truth. Meant protecting sources even at personal cost. Meant publishing stories that made powerful people uncomfortable.

Meant waking up to find anonymous envelopes under your door and recognizing them for what they were: trust.

Someone trusted her. Someone inside Oracle House, risking their career or freedom or life, had decided Ashcroft was worth that risk.

She wouldn't let them down.

Ashcroft looked at the envelope in her drawer, at the memos that documented systematic suppression. Her small room felt smaller suddenly, the walls closer. She was holding evidence that could reshape understanding of an entire industry. Could expose theft on a massive scale. Could prove that the colonial prosperity everyone celebrated was built on stolen foundations.

Could get both her and her source killed.

The thought sat in her chest like cold water. She was thirty-two years old, had been running the underground press for two years, had published dozens of stories about corruption and abuse and institutional failure. Had been threatened before, warned, pressured to stop.

But this felt different. Bigger stakes. More dangerous.

More important.

She closed the desk drawer. Stood. Paced the room again—three steps to the wall, turn, three steps back. The floorboards creaked their familiar protest. Outside, the city continued waking. People moving through their days, unaware that someone in a fourth-ward rented room was sitting on evidence that could change everything.

If she published it.

*When* she published it.

Because that's what the envelope meant. Not "consider this information" but "publish this." The source could have destroyed the documents, could have kept silent, could have looked away. Instead they'd copied them—risking discovery in the copying—and delivered them to someone who'd make them public.

That was instruction. That was trust.

That was responsibility.

Ashcroft returned to the desk. Pulled out another sheet of paper. Started drafting the article structure—what information to lead with, how to present the evidence, what verification she'd need before going to press.

The morning light grew stronger through the gap in her curtains. The city noise increased—more carts, more voices, more of the daily rumble. Spring in Fehn, slowly arriving, the thaw revealing what winter had hidden.

And in her small room, Ashcroft began the work of revelation. Slow, careful, methodical. The kind of journalism that took time but built cases that couldn't be dismissed.

The kind that protected sources while exposing truth.

*Whoever you are*, she thought again, looking at the drawer where the envelope waited, *I'll protect you. Promise.*
