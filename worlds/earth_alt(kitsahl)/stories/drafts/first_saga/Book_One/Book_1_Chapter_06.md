# BOOK 1: THE LEDGER
## Chapter 6

*Holgate | Bureau Archives, Fehn | After Midnight, April 16, 1862*

The correlation emerged sometime after midnight.

Holgate had three ledgers open on his desk, overlapping at angles that would have made any organized bureaucrat wince. The population maps were spread across what little space remained, edges curling where he'd weighted them down with teacups and ink bottles. His office was dark except for the oil lamp burning at his elbow, casting shadows that made the numbers seem to shift when he looked away and back.

He should have gone home hours ago. His wife would be asleep by now, or lying awake wondering if he was all right. She'd stopped asking what kept him late at the Bureau—had learned that auditing work consumed time in unpredictable ways, that sometimes a discrepancy needed chasing until it resolved or his eyes gave out.

She didn't know he'd stopped doing auditing work three weeks ago.

Didn't know he was cross-referencing militia payment records with population data for every Vethara-majority district in the northern territories. Didn't know he'd requisitioned demographic reports and census records and settlement maps, building a picture that the Bureau's careful compartmentalization was designed to prevent anyone from seeing whole.

Didn't know he'd found something.

His neck ached from hunching over the desk. He rolled his shoulders, heard something pop, felt the familiar pull of his jacket across his back. The fabric was getting tighter—he'd either gained weight from too many late-night meals eaten at this desk, or the jacket had shrunk from repeated soaking when he walked home in spring rain. Either way, the discomfort was constant now, a physical reminder that his body wasn't designed for this kind of sustained focus.

But the numbers didn't care about his comfort.

District Twelve. Militia payments in June 1860: 2,400 colonial marks. Vethara population according to the 1859 census: 960 individuals.

District Thirteen. Payments: 3,100 marks. Population: 1,240.

District Fourteen. Payments: 1,800 marks. Population: 720.

The ratio held. Approximately 2.5 marks per Vethara resident. Consistent across all three districts where he'd found the June gaps.

That could be coincidence. Could be random allocation based on district size or geographic spread or any number of factors that had nothing to do with the Vethara population specifically.

Except.

He pulled the map closer, his fingers leaving smudges on the aging paper. The oil lamp's light made the geographic boundaries clearer—districts marked in faded ink, settlement locations noted with small dots. He'd marked the Vethara-majority areas in pencil, circling each one based on the census data.

The militia payment clusters matched the circles exactly.

Every district with significant Vethara population had received increased payments in June 1860. Every district where Vethara populations were minimal or absent showed no payment increases, no gaps in the ledgers, business as usual.

The payments weren't distributed by district size. Weren't based on total population. Weren't allocated according to geographic spread or administrative complexity.

They were targeted. Specifically. At areas where the Vethara lived.

Holgate sat back in his chair. The old wood creaked—that familiar sound that had marked every moment of realization over twenty-two years of desk work. His hands were shaking. He could see them trembling in the lamplight, fingers that had just traced the mathematical proof of systematic targeting.

Not random policing. Not routine military deployment. Not even aggressive pacification of rebellious populations.

This was something else. Something that required calculating payment amounts based on population counts. Something that needed funding proportional to the number of people who needed to be... 

He couldn't finish the thought. Not in words. But the numbers finished it for him.

2.5 marks per person. Enough to pay militia for what? A day's work? A week? How long did it take to eliminate a population of 960 individuals once you'd been paid to do it?

His stomach churned. The cold tea he'd drunk hours ago tasted metallic in his throat, threatening to come back up. He swallowed hard, tasted bile and old leaves and the archive dust that never quite left his mouth these days.

The oil lamp flickered. He needed to trim the wick, add more fuel. Basic maintenance that he'd been ignoring because stopping meant losing the thread of analysis, meant giving his mind time to reject what the numbers were showing him.

Better to keep working. Better to let the mathematics speak.

He pulled out his notebook—leather soft from carrying it in his inside pocket, pages accumulating the evidence he was building piece by careful piece. The notebook his wife didn't know existed. The investigation the Bureau didn't know he was conducting.

The proof that something terrible had been carefully planned and systematically financed.

*Districts 12, 13, 14: Payment amounts proportional to Vethara population. Ratio: 2.5 marks per person. Correlation 100%. Not random allocation. Targeted financing.*

Writing helped. Made it concrete. Made it evidence instead of horror. The scratch of his pen against paper was the only sound in the dark office, the only thing that felt normal when everything else had tilted into nightmare territory.

*They calculated how many militia per thousand people. Math proves planning.*

The thought settled in his chest like cold water sinking. This wasn't spontaneous violence. Wasn't even opportunistic aggression. This was bureaucracy. This was someone sitting at a desk—maybe in this very building—calculating payment ratios. Someone deciding that 2.5 marks per Vethara resident was the appropriate budget for whatever operation was being financed.

Someone had done the mathematics of genocide.

And then filed the paperwork properly. Recorded the payments. Maintained the ledgers. Created the very records that now proved what they'd done.

Because bureaucracy required documentation. Required ledgers and receipts and properly filed reports. Even when the bureaucracy was organizing mass death, it still needed to track the funding.

Holgate looked at the ledgers spread across his desk. Standard issue, identical to thousands of others in the Bureau archives. Brown leather binding, lined pages, columns for dates and amounts and signatures. Nothing special about them. Just tools for recording financial transactions.

Tools that had documented the financing of systematic elimination.

His hands were still shaking. He pressed them flat against the desk, felt the familiar scarred wood under his palms. Felt the tea stains and ink marks and the accumulated evidence of twenty-two years spent at this desk examining numbers, finding discrepancies, identifying patterns.

He'd always thought of his work as essentially neutral. Numbers weren't good or evil—they were just information. His job was finding errors, correcting mistakes, ensuring the Bureau's financial records were accurate and complete.

But these numbers weren't neutral. These numbers were evidence. These numbers proved that someone had sat down and calculated the cost of killing people, had allocated funding with the same dispassionate precision used for calculating office supply budgets or maintenance contracts.

These numbers had made genocide possible.

The realization made his chest tight. Made breathing difficult. He could feel his collar damp against his neck despite the office's chill—the coal stove had gone cold hours ago, nobody around to feed it fuel. The sweat was fear, he recognized that. His body responding to understanding before his mind could fully process it.

He was sitting in a government building. Late at night. With evidence that the government had systematically financed genocide. Evidence he'd assembled by cross-referencing records that were supposed to stay compartmentalized, that nobody was supposed to see together in a way that revealed the pattern.

If anyone knew what he'd found...

The thought trailed off. Brecht's warning echoed: *Document the drift. Submit your findings. Let others determine if further investigation is warranted.*

But there was no drift to document. There was only a systematic pattern of payments precisely calculated to fund operations in Vethara-majority areas. There was only evidence that genocide had been planned with bureaucratic thoroughness.

There was only proof that would get him disappeared if he reported it through proper channels.

Holgate looked at his notebook. At the population maps with their penciled circles. At the three ledgers showing their damning correlation.

His father had been a clerk. Different department, different building, but same Bureau. Same institutional culture of following procedures, maintaining records, doing your job without asking uncomfortable questions. His father had spent thirty years filing reports and managing archives and retiring with a small pension that barely covered basic expenses.

His father had taught him that bureaucracy was honorable work. That record-keeping mattered. That accuracy and completeness and attention to detail were virtues worth building a career around.

His father had never mentioned that bureaucracy could also document atrocity.

The oil lamp flickered again. This time Holgate stood, his knees protesting after hours bent under the desk. He trimmed the wick with hands that were steadier now—purpose overriding fear. Added more oil from the can he kept in his desk drawer. The flame strengthened, pushing back the shadows.

He returned to the maps. Started marking additional districts, cross-referencing more payment records with population data. If the pattern held in Districts Twelve through Fourteen, it would hold elsewhere. All he needed to do was find more correlations, build a complete picture.

Prove that the genocide wasn't limited to three districts. Prove that it was systematic. Coordinated. Financed through the very institution where he now sat.

The work consumed him. Hours passed. His tea went from cold to room temperature. The coal stove stayed dead—he couldn't risk the smoke attracting attention to his late-night presence. Spring nights in Fehn were still cold enough that he could see his breath when he exhaled, faint clouds dissipating in the lamplight.

But the cold kept him alert. Kept his mind sharp as he traced correlations across district after district.

District Seven. Payments matched Vethara population. Ratio: 2.5 marks per person.

District Nine. Same pattern.

District Sixteen. Same ratio.

By the time dawn light started filtering through his window—weak and gray, doing nothing to warm the office—he'd documented the pattern across eleven districts. Eleven separate areas where militia payments correlated precisely with Vethara population counts.

Eleven pieces of evidence proving systematic planning.

His notebook was nearly full. Pages dense with numbers and ratios and geographic correlations. The mathematical proof of bureaucratic genocide, documented with the same attention to detail that the perpetrators had used to finance it.

Outside, the city was waking. He could hear cart wheels on cobblestones, vendors setting up for morning markets, the low rumble of people starting their day. Normal sounds. The soundtrack of a functioning society. People going about their business, secure in the belief that their government was fundamentally decent, that prosperity came from honest work rather than appropriated land and eliminated populations.

People who didn't know what the ledgers proved.

Holgate gathered the maps carefully. Folded them along their existing creases, stacked them in order. The ledgers went back in the cabinet where they belonged, filed properly because bureaucratic habit died hard even when you were investigating bureaucratic atrocity.

His notebook stayed in his inside jacket pocket. The evidence close to his chest, literally. The proof that would mean prison or death if the Bureau discovered he had it.

The proof that someone needed to have. Someone needed to know. Someone needed to document what the numbers revealed.

Because genocide didn't stop being genocide just because it was properly financed and documented in official ledgers. Didn't become acceptable just because someone had calculated the payment ratios with bureaucratic precision.

Didn't disappear just because everyone preferred not to think about it.

Holgate looked at his desk. At the tea stains and ink marks and the scarred wood that bore witness to twenty-two years of patient work. Work he'd thought was neutral, honorable, just finding errors and maintaining accuracy.

Work that had just proved systematic elimination had been carefully planned and financed.

He picked up his jacket from where it hung on his chair. The fabric pulled tight across his shoulders when he shrugged into it—too small now, or he was too big for it. Either way, uncomfortable. A constant reminder that bodies changed, that time passed, that nothing stayed the same.

Not even auditors who thought they were just examining ledgers.

He locked his office door. Walked down the corridor—empty at this hour, the morning shift not yet arrived. His footsteps echoed on tile floors that would soon be busy with clerks and administrators and all the people who kept the bureaucracy functioning.

All the people who would go about their work never knowing what the records they maintained actually proved.

Outside, spring morning air hit his face. Cold and damp, carrying the smell of city thaw—horse shit and mud and chimney smoke beginning as people lit their breakfast fires. Normal smells. The scent of civilization going about its business.

Holgate walked home through streets that were just beginning to fill with morning traffic. Vendors calling their wares. Neighbors greeting each other. The ordinary life of a city that functioned because people didn't look too closely at foundations.

In his pocket, his notebook contained proof that the foundations were built on systematic elimination.

The numbers proved it. The mathematics didn't lie.

2.5 marks per person. Calculated. Allocated. Paid. Filed.

Genocide as bookkeeping.
