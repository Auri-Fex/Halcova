## Chapter 2

*Saltmann | Oracle Maintenance Workshop, Fehn | April 1862*

Saltmann's hands knew the weight of the oracle before she opened it.

Too light. That was the first sign of degradation—when the internal mechanisms started breaking down, the casing felt hollow. She'd been doing this work long enough to diagnose by touch. Forty-three years maintaining the Trust Grid's oracles, keeping the colony's information network functioning, and she could tell what was wrong with a unit just by lifting it. Her hands knew that language the way other people knew words.

This one was dying.

She set it on her workbench, watched it leave a faint ring in the sawdust that accumulated despite her best efforts to keep the workshop clean. The sawdust got into everything—her clothes, her hair, the creases of her gloves. Spring light filtered through the high windows, weak northern sun that barely warmed the space. She could see her breath in the air when she exhaled, faint clouds dissipating. The workshop was always cold this time of year. The coal stove in the corner did its best, but with these high ceilings and poor insulation—this had been a warehouse once, built for cargo not comfort—heating the space was a losing battle.

Her fingers were already stiff with cold, despite the fingerless gloves she wore to keep enough dexterity for precision work. At sixty-eight, her hands weren't what they used to be. The joints ached in cold weather, stiffness settling into the knuckles first thing in the morning and not really leaving until midday if she was lucky. The fingers not quite as nimble as they'd been when she'd first apprenticed to this work at sixteen. Her wife kept saying retire, let younger hands do this. But younger hands might not notice what needed noticing.

And these hands still knew oracles. Still understood the weight and balance of properly functioning units versus degraded ones. That knowledge wasn't something you could teach from a manual—it came from years of handling the devices, feeling the subtle differences, learning to diagnose by touch.

She pulled her tools closer—precision screwdrivers, calibrated wrenches, the small magnifying lens on its articulated arm. Everything laid out in the order she'd use them, the ritual of preparation as familiar as breathing. Her workshop smelled the way it always did: machine oil, metal shavings, and the particular scent of degraded oracle components. Something like burned honey mixed with copper. Not quite organic, not quite mechanical. She'd asked once what oracles were made of. The Houses had provided maintenance procedures but never explanations of materials.

The casing opened with a faint hiss—residual pressure releasing, carrying that burned-honey smell stronger now. Saltmann wrinkled her nose. Definitely degraded. She'd need to replace at least three components, maybe the entire crystal lattice if the degradation had spread that far. Standard repair, the kind she'd done hundreds of times. Her hands knew the procedure so well she barely had to think about it.

Then she saw the script.

Inside the casing. Etched into the metal housing that protected the crystal core. Not stamped or printed—hand-carved, the lines showing the particular irregularity of someone working metal with deliberate care. Someone who knew what they were doing but was doing it by hand, not with a stamp or machine press. The characters were small, precise, running along the interior edge where they'd never be visible unless someone opened the unit.

Which they weren't supposed to do. The Houses preferred oracles replaced rather than repaired, preferred the internal workings to remain mysterious, proprietary.

Saltmann leaned closer, adjusted the magnifying lens. Her breath fogged the glass immediately. She wiped it with her sleeve—felt the canvas rough against the lens, realized too late she'd smeared it worse. The cuffs of her work coat were stiff with accumulated machine oil that soap could never quite remove, forty-three years of it building up in the fabric. The oil left a faint streak on the glass.

She wiped it again with a clean rag from her bench. The script came into focus.

Not colonial script. Not any of the formal languages used by the Houses or the Bureau. The characters had a different structure entirely—flowing, interconnected, with markers above and below the main line that suggested something tonal or temporal. Information encoded in position as well as form. Beautiful, actually. Whoever had carved this had known what they were doing, had cared about the work.

Her fingers traced the edge of the casing, not quite touching the script. The metal was cold under her fingertips, even through the worn leather of her gloves. She could feel her pulse jump in her throat—that particular sensation when curiosity activated, when something didn't make sense and her mind needed to understand it, to fit it into a pattern.

This was Vetharic script. Had to be. She'd seen fragments of it before, back when there were still Vethara settlements near enough to the city that their markets sold goods marked in their language. Before the... before whatever had happened. Before the populations declined and the settlements went quiet and the markets stopped selling anything marked in unfamiliar characters.

Before people stopped asking questions about where the Vethara had gone.

Saltmann sat back on her stool—old wood, padded with a cushion her wife had made years ago, the fabric worn thin now from decades of her weight but still comfortable. Her workshop was cluttered with the accumulation of those decades—spare parts organized in labeled wooden bins (her own labeling system, refined over years), half-repaired oracles waiting for components that were on order, technical diagrams pinned to the rough stone walls with tacks she'd hammered in herself. The walls themselves were part of an old warehouse the Houses had converted to oracle maintenance facilities. You could still see the marks where cargo hooks had been mounted, dark rectangles in the stone where decades of use had stained the surface with rust and wear.

She looked at the script again, leaning forward despite her back's protest. Sitting on a stool for hours wasn't good for a sixty-eight-year-old spine, but there wasn't room for a proper chair in here, not with all the equipment and parts bins.

Why hidden? If the Vethara had built these oracles—or helped build them, or designed some component, contributed their knowledge to the construction—why not acknowledge it? The Houses took credit for everything. Stamped their marks on every piece of technology, every innovation. Every oracle she'd ever seen had House seals on the exterior casing, proud proclamations of origin and ownership.

This should have had a House seal, not hidden script in a language most people couldn't read anymore.

The workshop door opened.

Saltmann's hands moved without thinking—closing the oracle casing, turning it so the opening faced away from the door. Her pulse jumped, the sudden spike of being caught doing something wrong. She could feel it in her neck, in her wrists, that animal reaction even though she was just doing her job. Opening oracles to repair them. Nothing unusual about that.

Except the Houses preferred oracles to be replaced, not repaired. Preferred the internal workings to remain mysterious.

Trevik stood in the doorway—her supervisor, middle-aged, wearing the formal jacket that marked House employment. She noticed the jacket first. Better wool than her canvas work coat, tailored to actually fit his frame instead of hanging loose or pulling tight. The brass buttons all matched—real brass, not cheap bronze painted to look expensive. His boots were new, or nearly so. Leather polished to a shine that caught the weak spring light filtering through the high windows. He smelled different from the workshop—cologne instead of machine oil, expensive instead of functional. The gap between their salaries made visible through scent.

"Progress on the Sector Seven unit?" His voice was pleasant enough. Professional. The tone of a supervisor checking on routine work.

Saltmann kept her hands on the oracle, covering the opening where she'd seen the script. "Degradation's extensive. Need to replace the crystal lattice, maybe the resonance chamber."

Trevik stepped closer. This close, she could see the fine weave of his jacket, the quality of the tailoring in how it draped across his shoulders. His salary versus hers. His House employment versus her contractor status. His new boots versus her work coat with its oil-stained cuffs and burn scars on the sleeves from decades of soldering work.

"Might be more cost-effective to replace the entire unit," he said, eyes scanning the oracle on her bench.

"Replacement takes three weeks." Saltmann's fingers tightened on the casing, felt the cold metal through her gloves. "Repair takes three days. Trust Grid can't afford three weeks of degraded service in Sector Seven."

"True." Trevik's eyes swept the workshop—the cluttered benches, the organized chaos of spare parts in their bins, the technical diagrams she'd accumulated over decades. Saltmann had worked here longer than he'd been alive, had maintained oracles since before he was born. Knew things about oracle maintenance that weren't in any House manual, knowledge built from thousands of repairs, from pattern recognition that only came with time. "Just remember—if you encounter anything... unusual... during repair, you report it."

The word hung in the cold air of the workshop. *Unusual.*

"Of course," Saltmann said, keeping her voice level, professional.

Trevik nodded and left. His boots on the stone floor—that crisp confident sound of new leather, well-maintained, expensive—faded toward the front offices where supervisors had heated rooms and proper desks. The door closed with a solid thunk that echoed in the high-ceilinged space.

Saltmann waited. Counted to thirty, listening to her own breathing, to the coal stove's occasional pop, to the faint hum of functioning oracles in the testing area. Listened for footsteps returning, for the door opening again, for Trevik coming back to check on her. Nothing. Just the distant sound of the city outside—cart wheels on cobblestones, someone shouting about fish for sale, the constant low rumble of a place where people lived and worked and moved through their days.

She opened the oracle casing again.

The script was still there. Still beautiful. Still hidden where it wasn't supposed to be found.

*Why hidden?*

The question circled in her mind, wouldn't settle. If the Vethara had made these—or contributed to their making—it was skilled work. Precise. The kind of craftsmanship that deserved acknowledgment, that spoke to knowledge and capability. But instead: hidden script, carved inside the casing, visible only during repair.

Which the Houses discouraged.

Which meant most people would never see this. Would never know that Vethari hands had touched these devices, that Vethara knowledge was built into the very technology that kept the colony's information flowing.

Saltmann pulled her notebook from the workbench drawer—small, leather-bound, pages filled with technical notes and repair observations accumulated over decades. The leather was worn soft from handling, the pages spotted with oil and ink and the occasional burn mark from when she'd set it down too close to soldering work. She sketched the script characters, working slowly to capture the particular flow of the lines, the markers above and below. Her hands shook slightly—cold or nerves, hard to tell which. The joints protested, arthritis making the fine motor control harder than it used to be. The charcoal pencil left smudges on the page, dark marks like shadows.

Outside, spring continued its slow arrival. Meltwater dripped from the eaves—she could hear it, the steady rhythm of water finding its way downward, running toward the gutters and the river beyond. In a few weeks, the streets would be passable again. The markets would expand beyond their winter minimums. People would emerge from their winter hibernation, blinking in the weak sun, grateful for temperatures above freezing.

But the Vethara settlements wouldn't. Those had gone quiet years ago. The populations had... declined, the Bureau reports said. Relocated, some said, though nobody seemed to know where. Just... gone, most people thought, if they thought about it at all. The Vethara who used to bring goods to market, who used to have settlements close enough to trade with, who used to mark their products in flowing script like this—they'd faded from the colony's awareness like morning fog burning off in sunlight.

Saltmann looked at her sketch. The characters seemed to shift in the uncertain light filtering through the high windows, beautiful and incomprehensible. Evidence of something. She wasn't sure what yet, but evidence nonetheless.

Her hands were cold. She rubbed them together, felt the joints protest—arthritis getting worse every year, the price of decades of precision work in unheated workshops doing damage that accumulated over time. Her wife kept telling her to retire, to let younger hands do this work, to spend her remaining years doing something that didn't hurt.

But younger hands might not notice the script. Might not care if they did. Might report it without thinking about what questions that raised, without understanding what it meant that something like this was hidden.

Saltmann turned back to the oracle. The crystal lattice needed replacement—that much was obvious, the degradation had spread through the component, making it brittle and non-functional. The degradation had compromised the unit's ability to transmit information through the Trust Grid. Standard repair, the kind she'd done hundreds of times over forty-three years.

But now she was thinking about who had built this. Whose hands had carved this script, had taken the time to etch these characters into metal where they'd be hidden. Why it was hidden.

And why the Houses wanted it to stay that way.

She pulled the crystal lattice free—the component came out easily, degradation making it brittle enough that she had to be careful not to crack it further. The burned-honey smell intensified, filling her nostrils. She set the ruined component aside, reached for a replacement from her organized bins. Found the right size, the right resonance frequency. Her hands knew which bin without looking, forty-three years of organizing her workspace the same way creating automatic knowledge. Standard repair procedure, every step familiar.

But her eyes kept drifting to the script.

*Not colonial language. Older? Different? Hidden.*

*Why hidden?*

The question wouldn't leave. Saltmann had learned over sixty-eight years that questions like this were dangerous. The kind that made supervisors nervous, that threatened comfortable arrangements, that suggested someone might be hiding something that needed to stay hidden. Questions that could cost you work, cost you income, cost you the stability that kept food on the table and heat in the house.

But she'd also learned that some questions, once asked, couldn't be unasked. Couldn't be ignored once you'd seen the evidence. Couldn't be forgotten just because noticing was inconvenient or dangerous.

She finished the sketch in her notebook. Closed it. Tucked it back in the drawer beneath layers of technical diagrams and repair logs, hidden like the script. Buried in the accumulated paperwork of decades so that nobody would find it unless they knew to look, unless they cared to dig through years of documentation.

Then she returned to the repair. Installed the new crystal lattice, her stiff fingers working through the familiar motions despite the cold, despite the arthritis. Calibrated the resonance chamber using the tools she'd laid out at the beginning, following the procedure she knew by heart. Tested the connections, verified the repair, confirmed the oracle was functional again. Standard procedure, all of it. The kind of work she could do in her sleep after forty-three years, the kind of work that had shaped her hands and her posture and her understanding of how these devices worked.

But her mind kept circling back to the characters carved inside the casing. To what they meant. To who had put them there and why. To what else might be hidden inside these oracles that everyone took for granted, that kept the colony's information flowing, that the Houses controlled and nobody questioned.

Until now.

Saltmann closed the oracle casing. The script disappeared, hidden again where it was supposed to stay. Where nobody would see it unless they looked, unless they opened units for repair instead of replacement, unless they cared to ask questions about things that were supposed to be settled.

Outside, meltwater dripped from the eaves in steady rhythm. Spring revealed what winter had hidden, the thaw exposing what months of freezing had covered.

And in her workshop, surrounded by decades of accumulated parts and knowledge and tools, Saltmann had just discovered that some things stayed hidden long after winter ended. That some secrets were buried deeper than seasonal snow, carved into metal and concealed inside devices that everyone used but nobody truly understood.
