# BOOK 1: THE LEDGER
## Chapter 3

*Nayen | Detention Facility, Fehn | April 1862*

The prison visiting room smelled like disinfectant failing to cover the scent of too many bodies in too small a space.

Nayen had learned that smell over the past three months. Harsh soap and old sweat and something underneath both—fear, maybe, or resignation. The kind of smell that soaked into stone walls and wouldn't leave no matter how much the guards scrubbed. She could taste it in the back of her throat when she breathed, chemical and human mixed together.

The table between her and Kohén was bolted to the floor. Everything here was bolted or chained or permanently fixed. As if prisoners might weaponize furniture, might tear chairs loose and use them as clubs. Maybe they had. Nayen didn't know the history of this room, just its present: bare stone walls, narrow window near the ceiling letting in weak spring light, the door with its viewing slot where a guard's face appeared periodically.

Watching. Always watching.

Kohén sat across from her, hands flat on the scarred wood of the table. Her nephew. Twenty-three years old, broad-shouldered from dock work, with their family's distinctive features—the strong nose, the dark eyes that seemed to see through pretense. He wore worker's clothes, canvas trousers and a wool shirt that had seen better days, the cuffs frayed where rope and cargo had worn the fabric thin. His hands were calloused, fingers thick from labor. Good hands for lifting and hauling. Not the hands of someone who kept journals or read ledgers.

But he was smart. Smarter than people assumed when they looked at his size and his calluses.

She needed him to be smart now.

"Tell me the story again," Nayen said. Her voice came out rougher than she intended. Three months of prison air—dry, dusty, tasting of stone—had done something to her throat. She cleared it, felt the rasp. "The one about spring-melt."

Kohén's eyebrows drew together. "Auntie, I know the—"

"Tell it." She glanced toward the door, toward the viewing slot. Empty for the moment, but that would change. The guards rotated their watches, appeared at irregular intervals. Meant to keep prisoners from timing their conversations to the gaps in surveillance. "Exactly as I taught you. Word for word."

He studied her face for a moment, then nodded. Understanding settling into his expression. This wasn't just tradition. This was something else.

"In the old days," Kohén began, his voice taking on the rhythmic cadence of oral recitation, "when winter lasted longer and spring came late, the people learned to bury their truth deep. They marked it with iron, with rings that wouldn't rust, with stone that wouldn't rot. They chose the east wall, the foundation where first light would touch when sun returned. They said: truth waits like seeds under snow. Spring-melt reveals what winter concealed."

Nayen watched his mouth form the words. Watched him get every syllable right, every pause in the correct place. Oral tradition required precision. One word changed could alter meaning, could lose the information encoded in the pattern.

"And where did they bury this truth?" she prompted.

"Under the iron ring marker," Kohén said. "East wall foundation. Where spring-melt would show them the ground had shifted, where they could dig when the time came."

"Metaphor?" His voice dropped slightly on the question, just enough that it might not carry to the viewing slot.

"Story," Nayen said. "Remember it exactly."

The guard's face appeared in the slot. Young man, maybe thirty, with the particular expression of someone who'd learned to watch without appearing to care. His eyes swept the room—two prisoners at the bolted table, hands visible, no contraband exchanged, conversation happening in voices too low to distinguish words clearly through the door.

The face disappeared.

Nayen waited. Counted to ten. Returned her attention to Kohén.

"My father kept a journal," she said. Not in the rhythmic cadence of story-telling, just quiet statement. "Documented what he saw. Names, dates, decisions. The planning before the genocide. Who gave which orders. How it was organized."

Kohén's hands tightened on the table. She could see his knuckles go white, see the tendons stand out. "Where—"

"He hid it before they came for him." Nayen kept her voice level, conversational. As if discussing something ordinary. Weather, maybe. Market prices. "Knew they'd search the house. Knew they'd destroy any evidence they found. So he buried it."

"Where?" The word came out barely above a whisper.

Nayen leaned forward slightly, hands still flat on the table where the guards could see them. "Truth buried under iron ring marker, east wall foundation." She repeated the words from the story, watching comprehension dawn in Kohén's eyes. "Story says spring-melt reveals what winter concealed. Remember exactly."

He stared at her. She could see him processing it—the oral tradition teaching suddenly snapping into focus as more than cultural preservation. The story was a map. The iron ring marker was real. East wall foundation meant something specific, some location her father had chosen and encoded into a story that would survive even if the teller didn't.

"I don't—" Kohén started.

"You do." Nayen's throat felt tight. She swallowed, tasted the prison air's chemical residue. "You know the old neighborhood. You know which buildings have east walls still standing. You know what iron ring markers look like—foundation anchors, the kind they used forty years ago when they built those warehouses."

Understanding settled into his expression like weight. "The old quarter. Where Grandfather lived."

"Story," Nayen said again. She glanced toward the viewing slot. Still empty. "Just a story. Traditional teaching. Nothing more."

But Kohén nodded, the movement small enough that it might have been unconscious. He understood. The journal existed. The location was encoded. Spring would come, the ground would thaw, and he could dig.

If she didn't survive to do it herself.

The thought sat in Nayen's chest like cold stone. Three months in prison, and she'd learned the patterns. The way prisoners who got too vocal suddenly got transferred to different facilities. The way people who documented things, who testified, who tried to make the genocide a matter of official record—those people had accidents. Fell down stairs. Contracted sudden illnesses.

She was forty-seven years old. Healthy, or she had been before imprisonment. But health wasn't armor against determined guards or convenient accidents.

"Tell me about the docks," she said, shifting the conversation to something the guards could hear without concern. "How's the work?"

Kohén followed her lead. "Same as ever. Heavy cargo this week. Southern timber shipment came in, they've got us hauling logs that must weigh..." 

He talked about work while Nayen watched his face. Saw him memorizing the story, turning it over in his mind, finding the seams where information hid inside cultural tradition. Her nephew. Her sister's son. Twenty-three years old and about to inherit a mission he hadn't asked for.

About to become the keeper of evidence that could prove genocide was planned, documented, organized by people who claimed it never happened or was simply tragic misfortune.

The guard's face appeared in the slot again. Stayed longer this time, watching them talk about dock work and timber shipments. Nayen kept her posture relaxed, kept her hands visible on the scarred table. Just an aunt and nephew having ordinary conversation. Nothing to see here.

The face disappeared again.

"Your mother?" Nayen asked. Her sister. Dead five years now, fever that the doctors said they could have treated if she'd come to them sooner. If she'd had money for doctors. If the Vethara settlements had doctors instead of traditional healers who knew herbs but not the medicines the Houses kept for themselves.

"Buried in the east quarter," Kohén said. The words carried layers. His mother's grave, their family's losses, the neighborhood where the old warehouses stood with their iron foundation rings.

East wall. Where spring-melt would reveal what winter concealed.

"She'd be proud of you," Nayen said. Her throat felt tight again, and this time it wasn't the prison air. "Working hard. Remembering the stories. Keeping tradition."

"Auntie—"

"Remember the story exactly," Nayen said. She held his eyes, let him see what she wasn't saying aloud. That she might not survive this. That the journal was insurance, evidence that could matter if anyone cared to look. That oral tradition was more than culture—it was survival, information preservation, a way to pass knowledge even when every written word was destroyed or confiscated.

That he was going to have to do this without her.

Kohén's jaw tightened. She saw him understand that too. Saw grief and anger and determination war in his expression. "I'll remember," he said. "Word for word."

"Good."

The guard's face appeared again. This time when it left, footsteps approached the door. Visit ending. They'd had twenty minutes, maybe. The allotted time for prisoner visits. Barely enough to exchange news, let alone encode crucial information in traditional stories.

But it had been enough.

Kohén stood when the guard opened the door. "I'll come back next week," he said. Loud enough for the guard to hear. Just a nephew promising to visit his imprisoned aunt. Nothing unusual about that.

"I'd like that," Nayen said.

She watched him leave. Watched the door close behind him, heard the lock engage with a heavy click. Then she was alone in the visiting room for the few minutes it took before guards would return to escort her back to her cell.

The table was still bolted to the floor. The walls were still stone, still smelling of disinfectant and failure. The window near the ceiling still let in weak spring light that did nothing to warm the space.

But Kohén had the story now. Had it memorized with the precision oral tradition demanded. Knew where her father's journal was buried, knew what it documented, knew that it existed as evidence waiting to be retrieved.

Truth buried but not lost, she thought. Spring-melt reveals what winter conceals.

Her father had written it all down. The planning, the organization, the casual discussions of how to solve the "Vethara problem" through systematic elimination. Who gave which orders. How they'd calculated populations and logistics and disposal. The bureaucratic machinery of genocide, documented by someone who'd worked in the Houses' administration and seen the memos, read the reports, understood what was coming.

He'd known they'd kill him for knowing. Had hidden the journal before they came. Had told Nayen where to find it, encoded in a story about truth and spring and iron markers.

Now Nayen had passed that story to Kohén. Had added her layer to the oral tradition, ensured that knowledge would survive even if she didn't.

The guards came to escort her back to her cell. Two of them, the standard protocol. One young, one older. The older one had tired eyes, the look of someone who'd done this job too long and stopped seeing prisoners as people. Just bodies to move from cell to visiting room and back again.

Nayen stood without being told. Let them flank her, guide her through the corridors. Stone walls on both sides, narrow passages designed to prevent groups from gathering, from organizing. The prison was built for isolation, for breaking down solidarity through architecture.

But they couldn't stop stories. Couldn't prevent oral tradition from passing information in patterns they didn't understand, in a language they'd never bothered to learn properly.

Back in her cell—narrow, cold, the sleeping pallet thin and the chamber pot in the corner making the small space reek—Nayen sat against the stone wall. 

Spring would come. The ground would thaw. Kohén would find the journal.

And maybe, if the journal survived, if someone cared to read it, if anyone was willing to acknowledge what it documented—maybe her father's death wouldn't be meaningless. Maybe the thousands who'd died would be counted, remembered, recorded as more than "population decline" or "tragic circumstances."

Maybe truth would matter more than comfort.

The thought wasn't particularly hopeful. Three months in prison had taught Nayen that comfort usually won. That people preferred easy lies to difficult truth. That genocide could be acknowledged, sanitized, and forgotten while the perpetrators lived comfortable lives and drew good salaries.

But the journal existed. The story was passed. Knowledge survived.

It would have to be enough.
