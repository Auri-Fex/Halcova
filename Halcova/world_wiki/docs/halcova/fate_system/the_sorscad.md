# The Sórscad: Fate Pattern System of Hálcova

## Overview


Every person born in Hálcova carries a **Sórscad** (SORE-skahd)—a five-part metaphysical pattern that describes who they are, how they move through life, and what they're likely to become.

The Sórscad is:

- **A metaphysical reality**: Something that exists in the fabric of Hálcova itself
- **A predictive framework**: Used by The Loom to calculate probabilities
- **A religious symbol**: Evidence of Fate's hand in mortal existence
- **A social marker**: Used in law, commerce, class determination, and identity

The Sórscad consists of:

- **Five Circles**: Core aspects of a person's being
- **Ten Cards per Circle**: Archetypal patterns within each aspect
- **One Card drawn per Circle**: Creating a unique five-card combination

A complete Sórscad reads like: *Léilcrù: Lantern — Húslaimh: Iron — Cóitcai: Pact — Hálmaht: Threshold — Sórscad: Road*

This becomes that person's pattern for life—spiritually, legally, economically, and statistically.
