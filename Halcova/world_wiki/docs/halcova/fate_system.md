# The Loom: Fate's Instrument

## Overview

**The Loom** is the distributed network of devices, rituals, and institutions that read, record, and predict fate in Hálcova. It is not a single machine but a system—part arcane technology, part religious practice, part bureaucratic apparatus.

More importantly: The Loom may be a point of contact with Fate itself. Whether Fate is an Elsewhere entity, a collection of entities, or something stranger is a matter of fierce theological debate. What's undeniable is that The Loom *works*. Its predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance. And something answers when the Loom-Keepers perform their divinations.

## What The Loom Is

### The Physical Infrastructure

**Loom-Nodes**

Distributed across Hálcova, Loom-Nodes are the physical anchors of the system:

- **Major Nodes**: Large installations in capital cities and religious centers. Cathedral-sized complexes housing pattern-engines, archives, and ritual spaces. Staffed by hundreds of Loom-Keepers.
- **Minor Nodes**: Town-level facilities. Smaller pattern-engines, local registries, drawing chambers. Staffed by licensed practitioners and temple appointees.
- **Mobile Nodes**: Portable equipment for frontier regions, military operations, and emergency readings. Less accurate but functional.
- **Private Nodes**: Illegal or gray-market installations operated by wealthy individuals, corporations, and criminal organizations. Quality varies wildly.

**The Pattern-Engines**

At the heart of each Node is a pattern-engine—a device that:

- Records Sórscad data from drawings
- Performs predictive calculations
- Communicates with other Nodes (major ones only)
- Interfaces with... something. The source of The Loom's impossible accuracy.

Pattern-engines are part clockwork, part alchemical apparatus, part something that defies categorization. Their construction is a closely guarded secret. Their fuel is Pattern Residue—the same substance that maintains echo anchors.

### The Institutional Structure

**The Loom-Keepers**

A guild-priesthood that operates The Loom. They are:

- Trained in pattern-reading, engine operation, and ritual practice
- Licensed by both religious and civil authorities
- Bound by oaths that constrain their use of Loom-knowledge
- Organized hierarchically from apprentices to High Weavers

Loom-Keepers occupy an ambiguous social position. They're essential to [Governance](governance.md), commerce, and religion. They're also viewed with suspicion—people who know too much about everyone else's fate.

**The Registry**

The accumulated database of all Sórscad patterns ever drawn. Stored in:

- Physical archives (paper, metal plates, encoded materials)
- Pattern-engine memory (poorly understood how this works)
- Distributed across major Nodes with varying levels of completeness

The Registry is legally protected, politically contested, and practically impossible to fully secure. Pattern-theft, registry-manipulation, and archive-raids are all documented crimes.

## Calculation Houses

Institutions using Loom data: actuarial houses, credit temples, [merchant guilds](society.md), legal colleges, military orders. License Loom access for insurance, lending, employment, sentencing, recruitment.

## What The Loom Does

Pattern recording: Sórscad drawn via ritual, captured, recorded, indexed, transmitted. Prediction: life-arc probabilities, decision tendencies, risk profiles, compatibility assessments. Deviation detection: minor, significant, anomalous—can indicate error, environment, manipulation, or theologically troubling events.

## The Source: Fate as Entity

Orthodox: Loom reads the Weaver's will. Heterodox: Loom's accuracy may come from Elsewhere entities, pacts, or Pattern Residue as payment. Loom-Keepers know something answers rituals but don't know what it is.

## The Accuracy Problem

Why does it work? Fate is real, Loom reads it; Loom creates what it predicts; Elsewhere entities arrange outcomes; combination. Bias: Loom reflects historical power structures, discrimination, feedback loops.

## Pattern Residue: The Fuel

Energy released when patterns dissolve at death. Natural sources: any death, more from trauma/heavy patterns. Manufactured: executions, blood-sport, war, plague, livestock. Used for Loom, core binding, alchemy, magitech. Economy: peace is expensive, war is profitable, disaster is opportunity.

## Regional Distribution

Core regions: dense Loom coverage, strong Orthodoxy, pattern-privileged. Peripheral: sparse coverage, mixed religion, deviation common. Frontier: minimal Loom, heterodox, unregistered. Contested: Loom is political battleground.

## Attitudes Toward The Loom

Universal acceptance of accuracy; disagreement about why. Faithful (divine will), pragmatists (useful), reformers (misused), skeptics (self-fulfilling), conspiracists (controlled).
