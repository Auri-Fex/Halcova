# Hálcova: Metaphysical Spine

## Overview

Hálcova isn't a world with an economy. Hálcova **is** an economy. The metaphysical substrate of reality operates on the same principles that govern markets, decisions, and resource allocation. This isn't metaphor—it's the literal structure of how existence functions here.

Physics has transaction costs. Identity is a balance sheet. Time is currency with variable exchange rates. Death is a market event. The Elsewhere is a competing market.

## Economic Principles Made Literal

### 1. Opportunity Cost (Fate Threading)

**The Principle**: Every choice forecloses alternatives. The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take.

**How It Manifests**:

When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're **harvesting the opportunity cost itself**. The future they didn't choose had value—stored potential—and they're cashing it out.

But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to *you*. When you harvest one:
- Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path
- Permanently close that path (it's been spent)
- Reduce your total remaining "decision space"

**The Horror**: Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic—not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives.

**The Economic Parallel**: This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. Hálcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit.

### 2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding)

**The Principle**: People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered.

**How It Manifests**:

Core Binding creates echoes—remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding.

The fallacy manifests when:
- The echo becomes corrupted or hostile
- The echo's information becomes outdated
- The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships

Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: "I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment."

**The Horror**: Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds.

**The Structural Element**: The magic system *rewards* sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful—if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy.

### 3. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning)

**The Principle**: When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks.

**How It Manifests**:

Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard:
- You get the power
