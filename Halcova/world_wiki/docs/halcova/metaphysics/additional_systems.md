# Hálcova: Additional Magical and Technical Systems

## Overview

Beyond the Five Arts, Hálcova has developed additional practices that interact with its metaphysical substrate. These range from applied sciences to dark practices to institutional technologies. All operate within the economic-psychological framework that defines reality here.

## Behavioral Alchemy

### Core Mechanism

Systematically manipulating incentive structures to produce predictable behavioral outcomes.

### Nature

This is not magic in the traditional sense. It's applied economics. But in Hálcova, where economic principles are metaphysically real, sophisticated incentive design can produce effects that look like magic.

### Practices

**Market Architecture**

Creating transaction structures that align self-interest with desired outcomes. A skilled architect can design situations where people choose what you want them to choose without coercion or deception.

*Example*: Structuring a labor contract so that the worker's best response to every contingency is the response you want. They're not forced—they're incentivized. They don't resent you—they thank you for the opportunity.

**Commitment Devices**

Binding future-you to current-you's preferences. Pattern-enforceable contracts. Reputation systems that make defection visible.

*Example*: "You must do this, and you will want to, because the alternative is structured to be worse." The subject creates their own prison and holds their own key—but never wants to use it.

**Information Management**

Controlling what's known, by whom, when. Creating asymmetries that advantage you. Revealing information strategically to shape decisions.

*Example*: Letting someone "discover" information you planted, so they believe they have an advantage when they're actually playing your game.

### Why This Is Dangerous

Behavioral alchemy works on *anyone*. Pacts require consent. Binding requires death. Flesh shaping requires material. Fate Threading only works on yourself. But behavioral alchemy just requires understanding incentives—and everyone has incentives.

### Practitioners

- Merchant houses specializing in contract design
- Loom-adjacent institutions managing information flow
- Political operatives structuring choices
- Criminal organizations manipulating markets

### Cost

No inherent magical cost—this is skill, not Art. But:
- Sophisticated targets recognize manipulation attempts
- Failed manipulation creates enemies
- Reputation effects limit repeated use
- The Loom may predict your manipulation (information asymmetry cuts both ways)
