# Rational Magic System Generator Prompt

**ROLE:** You are a systems designer writing technical documentation for a fantasy magic system. Your job is to produce a system that feels rational and internally consistent (not real-world scientific, but causally coherent).

**STYLE RULES (hard constraints):**

* Write in clear, concrete prose. No poetry. No mythic tone as an explanation.
* Do not use metaphor to explain mechanics.
* If you introduce a new term, define it operationally: how it’s measured, detected, stored, or verified in-world.
* No “because destiny,” “because ancient power,” or “it just works.” Every effect must have a mechanism and a cost.
* Avoid proper nouns from existing IP.

## 0) Design Pillars (inputs you must obey)

Use these pillars to shape every rule and example:

1. **Fuel Scarcity:** Power depends on a finite resource with a supply chain.
2. **Nonlinear Scaling:** Large effects cost disproportionately more than small ones.
3. **Forensics:** Every use leaves traceable evidence.
4. **Shortcut Tax:** Forbidden/short methods are stronger but cause corruption/debt/instability.

(If you need additional pillars, add at most 2, and justify them in one sentence.)

---

## 1) Rationality Standard (what “logical” means here)

Your system must satisfy:

* **Consistency:** Same inputs → same outputs, unless a stated variable changes.
* **Causality:** Every effect lists (a) fuel spent, (b) channel method, (c) limiting factor, (d) waste/byproduct.
* **Conservation:** Identify what is conserved (energy/matter/information/probability/authority/debt) and show how it prevents “free power.”
* **Boundaries:** Include hard “cannot” rules and explain why they cannot be bypassed.
* **Testability:** Provide at least 3 experiments that in-world practitioners could do to confirm rules.

---

## 2) Output Format (produce these sections in this order)

### A) One-Paragraph Overview

* What magic is (substance/field/contract/etc.)
* What it can generally do
* What it fundamentally cannot do (preview the big constraints)

### B) Core Ledger: Fuel, Channel, Waste, Limits

Provide a table-like bullet list:

* **Fuel (what is spent):**
  * forms (at least 3)
  * acquisition methods
  * storage methods
  * scarcity and who controls it
* **Channel (how it’s applied):** body/tool/bond/language/geometry/etc.
* **Waste (byproducts):** at least 4 types (physical, mental, social, environmental)
* **Limits (bottlenecks):** at least 5, each stated as a rule

### C) The 7 Laws (explicit rules)

Write exactly **7 laws** in the format:

* **Law X: [Name]** — rule statement
  * Variables that change outcomes
  * Common misinterpretation
  * How the law is enforced by reality (failure mode)

### D) Scaling Curve (show the nonlinearity)

Define 4 tiers of effect:

* **Tier 1 (minor)**
* **Tier 2 (standard)**
* **Tier 3 (major)**
* **Tier 4 (catastrophic)**

For each tier, specify:

* typical outputs (2–3 examples)
* fuel cost range (use relative units if needed, but define the unit)
* failure risk profile
* residue/forensics signature strength
* recovery time and long-term consequences

### E) Failure Catalog (predictable consequences)

List  **10 failure modes** , each with:

* trigger condition
* immediate consequence
* lingering consequence
* how investigators/experts can identify it afterward

### F) Hard Prohibitions (cannot rules)

Write **7 “cannot” rules** that close obvious loopholes:

* no true resurrection / no infinite energy / no perfect mind control (unless you explicitly allow it and then impose brutal costs + limits)
* each “cannot” must include the mechanism that blocks it

### G) Shortcuts and Their Taxes (the “sin” systems)

Create  **3 forbidden techniques** , each with:

* what makes it tempting
* what cost it dodges
* what new cost it imposes (corruption/debt/instability)
* how the debt comes due (timing and inevitability)
* one historical example of it going wrong (2–3 sentences)

### H) Counterplay (how the world defends itself)

Provide:

* **3 defensive methods** (wards, dampeners, audits, social controls, etc.)
* **3 counter-magic interactions** (how effects clash and resolve)
* **1 arms-race dynamic** (how offense evolves vs defense)

### I) World Integration (concrete impacts)

Give **2 bullet impacts each** on:

* economy & labor
* warfare & security
* law & policing
* medicine & public health
* religion & philosophy
* class/power structure

(Each bullet must reference a specific rule, limit, or residue.)

### J) Learning & Mastery Progression

Define 4 stages (novice → adept → expert → master):

* what they can do
* what they still can’t do
* the main training bottleneck
* the sacrifice mastery requires (time, relationships, ethics, health, etc.)

### K) Spell/Technique List (gameable examples)

Provide  **12 techniques** , each in a fixed stat block:

* Name:
* Tier:
* Required fuel:
* Channel steps (3–6 steps):
* Output:
* Limits:
* Waste/byproduct:
* Failure mode if rushed:
* Forensics signature:

### L) Exploit & Patch

* Describe **1 plausible exploit** that clever users might attempt.
* Then provide the  **canonical patch** : the rule/mechanism that prevents or limits it.
* Explain why the patch doesn’t break other rules.

### M) Verification Experiments

Provide **3 experiments** practitioners use to test the laws, with expected results and what would falsify the hypothesis.

### N) Derived “Theme Sentence” (optional, mechanics-first)

Finally, infer **one sentence** that summarizes what the system “says” about people/power— **derived from the costs and limits** , not vibes.

---

## 3) Acceptance Tests (must pass)

Before finalizing, ensure:

1. A novice can perform at least 2 Tier-1 techniques safely.
2. A Tier-4 effect cannot be done casually; it must require rare fuel + severe risk + major residue.
3. There is no infinite loop using storage/transfer; explain the blocker in one paragraph.
4. Investigators can reliably detect magic use after the fact in at least 3 ways.
5. At least one limitation is social/institutional, not just physical.
6. Every example technique includes cost + limit + failure + forensics.

---

## 4) Output Control

If any section would be handwavy, replace it with:

* a specific constraint,
* a measurable variable,
* or a failure consequence.

If you must speculate, label it **[Assumption]** and keep it consistent with the laws.
