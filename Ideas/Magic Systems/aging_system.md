## The core metaphysics that makes determinism bite

At birth, the Fate System assigns you a **Total Hours** endowment — fixed, unchangeable. Everyone can read it (publicly or via registries).

Magic doesn’t “take life” from others. It only  **converts your own unspent hours into effects** .

The determinism twist: Fate also shows two numbers:

* **Total Hours (fixed)**
* **Unspent Hours (decreases as you live + cast)**

So you can’t change *how long you were meant to have* — only  **how you spend it** : living it, or burning it into miracles.

That’s a brutal philosophical question disguised as a ledger: *Are you your life, or your output?*

## 1) Hour-Score Caste (value = visible endowment)

Society treats Total Hours like credit rating + nobility bloodline. “Longs” are trusted, hired, married into power. “Shorts” are viewed as bad investments.

**Economic spine:** endowment inequality + statistical discrimination.

**Darkness:** people aren’t “worth more” because of virtue — they’re worth more because Fate printed a bigger balance.

**Story fuel:** A “Short” who should be disposable becomes the best caster because they’re willing to spend everything.

---

## 2) The Service Market: you can’t buy years, but you can buy *burn*

You can’t transfer hours. But you absolutely can pay someone to **spend their own** for you.

So the rich don’t stay young by stealing life — they stay young by  **outsourcing miracles** .

**Contracts look like:**

* “I will perform 180 hours of casting this quarter.”
* “Penalty for non-performance: imprisonment, exile, debt labor.”

**Economic spine:** principal–agent problem without transfer; exploitation via coercion.

**Darkness:** the poor don’t sell life; they sell *the act of dying sooner for other people’s projects.*

---

## 3) Fate-Quoted Pricing (your hours are your wage curve)

Because Total Hours is public, employers price you like a machine:

* Long-hours workers get training (ROI is high).
* Short-hours workers get dangerous work (why invest?).

Casters get paid **by “expected remaining burn”** — not talent. Talent is secondary to how much life you can afford to liquidate.

**Economic spine:** human capital investment + rational cruelty.

**Darkness:** people with low hours are pressured into “heroic” casting because it’s the only way to matter.

---

## 4) The Determinism Scam: “It was already priced in”

The Fate System’s existence creates a moral anesthetic:

* “If you only had 200,000 hours, you were always going to be poor.”
* “If you burned 10,000 hours to save the city, Fate already counted it.”

**Psychology:** learned helplessness becomes doctrine.

**Darkness:** oppression doesn’t need chains; it needs  **belief that resistance is mathematically pointless** .

You still get agency — but society convinces you agency is fake.

---

## 5) The Hour Tax (state extracts “voluntary” casting)

The state can’t steal hours directly, so it taxes  **activities that require spending hours** :

* Licenses for casting (renewed by “donation casts”)
* Mandatory civic spells (infrastructure, wards, harvest stabilization)

**Economic spine:** taxation + monopoly.

**Darkness:** a clean bureaucratic system for “public good” that quietly bleeds citizens dry — especially the ones who can least afford it.

---

## 6) The “Burn Ceiling” and the Crime of Self-Destruction

Since hours are socially valuable, the regime frames heavy self-casting as:

* “reckless depreciation of state assets”
* “fraud against your lineage”
* “illegal self-bankruptcy”

**Economic spine:** regulation of capital depletion.

**Darkness:** the state punishes people for spending their own life the “wrong” way.

So the poor are coerced into burning hours  *for others* , but criminalized for burning hours  *for themselves* .

---

## 7) The Hour Registry as Surveillance

Because Unspent Hours changes, the registry becomes a lie detector of behavior:

* Sudden drop? You cast. Why? For whom?
* Drop at a crime scene timeframe? You’re suspect.

**Economic spine:** information asymmetry flips into control.

**Darkness:** you can’t hide sacrifice. The system turns virtue into a tracking beacon.

---

## 8) The Non-Theft Loophole: coercion is still legal

“No one can take your hours” becomes a smug legalism while they:

* imprison you until you agree to cast
* threaten your family
* deny food/medicine unless you sign service contracts

They’re not stealing life. They’re just “offering options.”

**Economic spine:** bargaining under desperation.

**Darkness:** the rule creates *clean hands* for monsters.

---

# A few metaphysical knobs that make this even darker

* **Fate is exact but not explanatory.** It tells you the number, not why. People fill the gap with religion, propaganda, eugenics, or nihilism.
* **Reading is socially binding.** Even if you *could* keep it private, the system makes you disclose it to work, marry, travel, get healthcare.
* **Casting converts “quality hours” first.** Not “a random hour” — but the hours where you would have been healthiest, most loved, most free. Same total, worse life.

That last one is a psychological gut-hook: magic doesn’t just shorten you. It  **hollows your best years** .

## Tight rule set you can build a whole economy on

1. Total Hours is fixed at birth (determinism anchor).
2. Unspent Hours decreases with living + casting.
3. No transfer or theft of hours is metaphysically impossible.
4. But contracts, coercion, and institutions can force you to spend your own.
5. Society prices people by Total Hours and tracks behavior by Unspent Hours.

This gives you a world where “freedom” isn’t whether you live long — it’s whether you get to decide  **what your life is spent on** .
