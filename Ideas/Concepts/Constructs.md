# Constructs

This file will detail the various methodologies for creating autonomous constructs and golems in the arcane punk fantasy setting. Each method provides a unique source of intelligence and learning style.

## Methodologies

1. **Runic Matrix (Programming)**
   - Magical runes and glyphs programmed for logic and behavior.

     **Lore:** Ancient schools of runesmiths pass down secret glyph patterns, each with unique tactical philosophies. Some runic constructs are considered “artworks,” their logic circuits admired for elegance and complexity. Rivalries exist between runesmiths, with signature rune sets becoming legendary in the arena.
     **Creation:** Runes are inscribed during a ritual, often requiring rare inks, metals, or magical catalysts. The process is meticulous, with each glyph placement affecting the construct’s “personality” and tactical style.
     **Cultural Impact:** Runesmiths are respected as both engineers and artists. Their constructs are seen as reflections of their intellect and creativity.
   - Intelligence is static or modular, requiring manual updates.

    **Strength:** Flawless execution of programmed tactics.
    **Limitation:** Inflexible—cannot adapt to surprises or chaos.
    **Vulnerability:** Easily countered by unpredictable opponents or magical interference.

2. **Soul Fragment (Training)**

     **Lore:** Soulbinding is a controversial art, with debates over ethics and legality. Some fragments are volunteered, others are remnants of heroes or magical beings. Constructs with soul fragments may display quirks, memories, or even echoes of their original selves.
     **Creation:** A ritual binds the fragment to a vessel—often a gem or enchanted heart—then integrates it into the construct. Training is ongoing, with coaches forming deep bonds with their constructs.
     **Cultural Impact:** Soulbinders are viewed with awe and suspicion. Their constructs are celebrated for their “living” qualities, but some fear the risks of emotional instability or spiritual backlash.
   - A shard of a soul bound within the construct.
   - Learns through experience and guidance, developing unique personalities.

    **Strength:** Deep intuition and adaptability.
    **Limitation:** Emotional volatility—can be manipulated or destabilized.
    **Vulnerability:** Prone to fatigue, doubt, or magical “soul attacks.”


     **Lore:** Alchemists are seen as mad scientists, always experimenting with new admixtures. Some legendary cores are rumored to have “evolved” sentience or unique magical powers. The unpredictability of alchemical constructs makes them crowd favorites for dramatic upsets.
     **Creation:** The core is assembled in a sealed vessel, with ingredients chosen for their magical and reactive properties. The mixture is activated by a catalyst, and the construct’s intelligence emerges as the reactions stabilize.
     **Cultural Impact:** Alchemical teams are known for risk-taking and innovation. Their constructs are unpredictable, sometimes mutating mid-match, which adds excitement and danger.
3. **Alchemical Core (Feedback Loops)**
   - Magical admixture in a sealed vessel forms dynamic logic circuits.
   - Intelligence emerges and evolves from internal reactions and external stimuli.

    **Strength:** Evolves and mutates in response to stimuli.
    **Limitation:** Unpredictable—may develop unwanted traits or lose control.
    **Vulnerability:** Susceptible to alchemical sabotage or environmental hazards.

     **Lore:** Homunculus creation is a blend of biology and magic, with roots in ancient golem lore. Imprinting rituals are closely guarded secrets, and some homunculi are rumored to possess “hidden” knowledge or forbidden spells.
     **Creation:** The organic brain is grown in a vat, then imprinted with magical knowledge and personality. The process is fast, but the homunculus may lack depth or adaptability.
     **Cultural Impact:** Homunculus makers are seen as pragmatic and efficient. Their constructs are reliable, but sometimes criticized for lacking “soul” or creativity.

4. **Homunculus Brain (Direct Magical Imprinting)**
   - Magically grown organic brain imprinted with knowledge and skills.
   - Intelligence is set via spells or rituals, can be refreshed as needed.

    **Strength:** Highly specialized and efficient.
    **Limitation:** Rigid—cannot learn or change mid-match.

     **Lore:** Crystal crafters are attuned to the magical flows of the world, often working in harmony with ley lines or ancient sites. Some crystals are legendary, said to have absorbed centuries of magical history.
     **Creation:** The crystal is selected for its resonance properties, then attuned in a ritual to the desired magical frequency. The construct’s intelligence shifts as it synchronizes with its environment.
     **Cultural Impact:** Crystal teams are known for adaptability and mystique. Their constructs are unpredictable in new arenas, sometimes gaining unexpected powers or weaknesses.
    **Vulnerability:** If imprinted knowledge is outdated, performance suffers.

5. **Crystal Core (Resonance Synchronization)**
   - Magical crystal processor adapts to ambient magical frequencies.
   - Intelligence and abilities shift based on environmental resonance.

    **Strength:** Adapts to magical environments.
    **Limitation:** Dependent on ambient magic—weak in neutral zones.
    **Vulnerability:** Can be disrupted by resonance manipulation or magical “jamming.”
