# Mycothurgy: The Art of Fungal Magic

## Core Principle
All magic is derived from the manipulation, cultivation, and symbiosis with a vast, intelligent mycelial network that permeates the world. Practitioners—called Mycothurges—tap into this network through biochemical, bioengineering, networked, environmental, and energetic means.

---

## 1. Biochemical Manipulation
- **Mechanics:** Practitioners extract, synthesize, and administer fungal compounds (serums, spores, toxins) to themselves or others.
- **Access:** Requires knowledge of fungal species, chemistry, and safe handling.
- **Risks:** Overuse can cause addiction, mutation, or fungal infection.
- **Examples:** Buff/debuff serums, spore bombs, hallucinogenic clouds.

---

## 2. Bioengineering & Symbiosis
- **Mechanics:** Practitioners cultivate symbiotic fungi within or on their bodies, or graft fungal organs/limbs for enhancement.
- **Access:** Requires surgical skill, genetic knowledge, and a willing (or desperate) host.
- **Risks:** Grafts may rebel, mutate, or require maintenance; symbiosis can alter personality or biology.
- **Examples:** Regenerative limbs, enhanced senses, mutagenic surges, living healing poultices.

---

## 3. Networked Communication & Control
- **Mechanics:** Practitioners use the mycelial network for communication, surveillance, and control—either through resonance (music, vibration) or by commanding engineered fungal drones.
- **Access:** Requires attunement to the network, special instruments, or drone cultivation.
- **Risks:** Network can be hacked, overloaded, or transmit psychic “infections.”
- **Examples:** Spore songs, drone swarms, telepathic links, accessing distributed intelligence.

## 4. Environmental Manipulation & Growth
- **Mechanics:** Practitioners accelerate or direct fungal growth to reshape the environment, create barriers, or encode spells into living mycelium.
- **Access:** Requires spores, nutrients, and environmental knowledge.
- **Risks:** Uncontrolled growth can cause ecological collapse or attract predators.
- **Examples:** Rapidly grown barriers, sporefields, encoded spell-traps, living bridges.

---

## 5. Energetic & Psychological Influence
- **Mechanics:** Practitioners harness the bioelectric and biochemical energy of the mycelium to boost physical abilities or influence minds via pheromones and spore auras.
- **Access:** Requires internal symbiosis and mental discipline.
- **Risks:** Overexertion can cause burnout, loss of self, or psychic backlash.
- **Examples:** Kinetic boosts, morale auras, emotion control.

## System Features

- **Attunement:** Each practitioner must attune to the mycelial network, which can be done through ritual, ingestion, or grafting.
- **Resource Management:** Magic use depletes personal or environmental fungal resources (spores, nutrients, energy).
- **Mutation Table:** Overuse or failed magic can cause beneficial or detrimental mutations.
- **Network Events:** The mycelial network is semi-sentient and can react to large-scale magic, sometimes aiding or hindering practitioners.
- **Specializations:** Practitioners may focus on one or more categories, gaining unique abilities and drawbacks.

## Example Mechanics

- **Spore Points:** A resource spent to activate abilities, replenished by rest, consuming mushrooms, or connecting to the network.
- **Symbiosis Level:** Tracks the depth of fungal integration; higher levels grant more power but increase risk of mutation or loss of autonomy.
- **Network Access:** Allows for communication, information gathering, and remote spellcasting, but can be jammed or corrupted.
- **Environmental Control:** Practitioners can “seed” areas with mycelium, making them more powerful within their own territory.

## Expanded Mechanics by Category

### 1. Biochemical Manipulation
- **Synthesize Serum:** Spend Spore Points and make a skill check (e.g., Nature or Alchemy) to create a serum. Effects: temporary buffs (strength, speed, resilience), debuffs (poison, confusion), or healing. Side effects possible on failure (addiction, hallucination).
- **Deploy Spore Bomb:** Use an action to throw or plant a spore bomb. Targets in the area must save or suffer effects (sleep, confusion, fear, etc.).
- **Harvest Fungi:** Gather rare mushrooms from the environment to replenish Spore Points or craft unique serums.

### 2. Bioengineering & Symbiosis
- **Graft Enhancement:** Spend downtime and Spore Points to graft a fungal organ or limb. Gain a permanent ability (e.g., darkvision, regeneration, toxin resistance). High Symbiosis Level required for advanced grafts.
- **Mutagenic Surge:** Spend Spore Points to trigger a mutation. Roll on a mutation table for random effects (beneficial or detrimental). Can be used in emergencies for a power boost.
- **Fungal Healing:** Use an action and Spore Points to apply a living poultice, accelerating healing or curing disease. Risk of minor mutation if overused.
