# Worldbuilding Expansion: Mycothurgy Setting

## Biomes
- **Luminescent Forests:** Vast regions where bioluminescent fungi light the landscape, creating surreal, glowing woodlands. Home to unique flora and fauna adapted to fungal magic.
- **Spore-Choked Ruins:** Abandoned cities overtaken by aggressive fungal growth, filled with airborne spores and mutated creatures.
- **Underground Mycelial Cities:** Subterranean settlements built within massive mycelial networks, featuring living architecture and spore-based technology.
- **Floating Fungal Islands:** Islands of buoyant, interconnected fungi drifting above the land, accessible only by air or magic.

## Factions

## Factions

**1. Magitech Corporations**
Control Spore Crystal mines and Gleam production. Develop fungal-based technology, vehicles, and infrastructure. Motivated by profit, innovation, and dominance over resources. Rivalries between corporations drive technological arms races.

**2. Spore Cults**
Worship the mycelial network as a living deity. Seek spiritual enlightenment, biological transcendence, or unity with fungi. Some cults are peaceful, others radical—spreading spores to “convert” others. Secretive rituals, fungal symbiosis, and psychic communication.

**3. Eco-Revolutionaries**
Fight to preserve natural fungal biomes and prevent ecological collapse. Oppose overharvesting and magitech exploitation. Use guerrilla tactics, sabotage, and spore-based magic. Advocate for balance between civilization and mycelial nature.

**4. Mycelial Syndicates**
Underground networks trafficking in rare fungi, Spore Crystals, and illicit Gleam. Control black markets, smuggling routes, and information flows. Often operate in spore-choked ruins and underground cities.

**5. Fungal Nomads**
Roam fungal deserts, tundra, and taiga, living in harmony with harsh environments. Trade rare spores, survival knowledge, and fungal adaptations. Resistant to mutation, skilled in resource management.

**6. Network Technocrats**
Masters of the mycelial “internet,” controlling communication and data. Influence politics, commerce, and culture through spore broadcasts. Seek to expand the network’s reach and intelligence.

**7. Mutationists**
Embrace mutation and adaptation, seeing it as the next step in evolution. Experiment with Gleam, spore exposure, and symbiotic grafts. Form enclaves where radical transformation is celebrated.

**8. The Spore Exchange Company**
A powerful, globe-spanning trading company reminiscent of the East India Trading Company. Controls major trade routes, fungal ports, and markets for Spore Crystals, Gleam, and magitech. Wields immense political and economic influence, often manipulating conflicts for profit. Their fleets and mercenaries enforce monopolies and suppress rivals, making them a source of constant tension and intrigue.

## Magitech
- **Spore-Powered Vehicles:** Transportation powered by Spore Crystals and fungal energy.
- **Living Buildings:** Structures grown from mycelium, self-repairing and responsive to environmental changes.
- **Bioengineered Tools:** Equipment and weapons enhanced or grown from fungi, often with unique magical properties.
- **Mycelial Internet:** Communication network using the mycelial web for instant, secure messaging and data transfer.

## Ecological Tension
- **Balance of Power:** Struggle between fungal expansion and traditional civilization; overuse of fungal magic risks ecological collapse or awakening ancient mycelial intelligences.
- **Resource Scarcity:** Competition for Spore Crystals and fertile fungal biomes drives conflict and innovation.

## Mutation & Adaptation
- **Character Evolution:** Exposure to fungal magic causes mutations—some beneficial, some detrimental. Adaptation is key to survival and power.
- **Creatures:** Wildlife and monsters evolve unique traits in response to the fungal environment, creating new challenges and opportunities.

## Network Events
- **Mycelial Broadcasts:** The sentient mycelial network occasionally sends visions, warnings, or commands to attuned individuals, influencing society and personal destinies.
- **Global Effects:** Large-scale magic or resource extraction can trigger network-wide events, altering biomes, causing mutations, or shifting faction power.
