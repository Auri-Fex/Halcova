# Combat System — "Personal Circuits"

## Core Principle (LOCKED)

Selnara uses a **"personal circuits" duel logic** where:

* Normal gunfire and blades exist
* Combatants with Signal Pale access can interrupt/deflect/anticipate using **somatic tuning (latchhands)** over very short windows (seconds)
* **This is not bullet-deflection wizardry.** It's exploiting the opponent's flinch, breath hitch, or line-of-sight with nerve-echo and timing theft

## Combat Philosophy

### "Duels are Conversations in Violence"

Combat between trained practitioners is:
* Short bursts of action
* Reading and countering tells
* Stealing timing windows
* Creating false openings

### Untrained vs. Trained

**Untrained combatant**: Relies on speed, aim, positioning

**Trained practitioner**: Adds somatic tuning to steal 0.5–2 seconds of advantage through:
* Flinch-Steal (anticipate draw)
* False-Step (induce false flinch)
* Steady-Hand (stabilize aim under pressure)
* Wire-Ear (hear safety click through wall)

## The Three-Phase Exchange Structure

### Phase 1 — The Setup (3–10 seconds)

**Establishing distance, reading posture, breath sync**

Both parties:
* Position for sight lines
* Assess terrain
* Watch for technique tells
* Build sensory map

Key techniques used:
* Wire-Ear (listen for movement)
* Pressure-Read (feel floor vibrations)
* Tell-Map (if contact possible)

### Phase 2 — The Break (0.5–3 seconds)

**One party initiates; the other counters or mirrors**

This is where combat is won or lost:
* Draw speed vs. Flinch-Steal
* Aim vs. False-Step
* Strike vs. Mirror-Stance

### Phase 3 — The Aftermath (5–30 seconds)

**Cost payment: shaking, nausea, disorientation, or injury**

Win or lose, both parties suffer:
* Physiological technique cost
* Injury consequences
* Environmental exposure (witnesses, authorities)
* Reputation impact

## Spell Families (What Practitioners Actually Do in Fights)

### 1) LINE-STEAL

**Goal**: Take the first shot by anticipating opponent's draw

**Technique**: Flinch-Steal + Steady-Hand

**Execution**:
1. Lock eye contact
2. Sync breath with opponent
3. Feel their pre-draw muscle tension
4. Draw 0.5–1 second early
5. Fire before they complete draw

**Counter**: Mirror-Stance (sync to prevent reading) or False-Step (induce false reading)

**Cost**: Muscle echo, hand tremor afterward

### 2) DRIFT-BREAK

**Goal**: Make opponent miss by inducing false motion perception

**Technique**: False-Step or Vertigo-Touch

**Execution**:
1. Establish position
2. Create false motion cue (weight shift, finger snap)
3. Opponent fires at phantom position
4. Counter-strike during their realization window

**Counter**: Fear-Cut (suppress startle) or Wire-Ear (verify position by sound)

**Cost**: Operator also feels disorientation

### 3) SENSE-HOLD

**Goal**: Maintain awareness and accuracy under suppression fire

**Technique**: Wire-Ear + Steady-Hand + Pain-Gate

**Execution**:
1. Take cover
2. Suppress pain/fear response
3. Listen through gunfire
4. Stabilize aim despite cover rattle
5. Emerge and fire with precision

**Counter**: Drift-Whisper (false sound cue) or sustained suppression (force technique collapse)

**Cost**: Severe after-effects (pain crash, tremor, nausea)

### 4) MIRROR-LOCK

**Goal**: Dominate close-quarters exchange by matching opponent perfectly

**Technique**: Mirror-Stance + Nerve-Echo

**Execution**:
1. Enter close range (arm's length)
2. Match posture exactly
3. Sync nervous system
4. Predict and counter every movement
5. Create no-win stalemate or force error

**Counter**: Break range, use environment, accept trade

**Cost**: Identity blur, difficulty breaking sync

## Combat Environment Factors

### Signal Pale Concentration

**Rich environments** (telegraph stations, refineries):
* Techniques reliable
* Effects stronger
* Longer durations possible

**Poor environments** (open desert, deep mines):
* Techniques unreliable
* Effects weak
* Skilled practitioners still have edge via training

### Witnesses and Social Cost

Duels witnessed by:
* **Telegraph operators**: Will report technique use
* **Seal Syndics**: May flag for Standard Enclave boundary violation
* **Civilians**: Create reputation spread

### Legal and Institutional Responses

Use of somatic tuning in violence:
* May violate Standard Enclave protocols
* Creates insurance complications
* Attracts Neutral Pier arbitrator interest
* Marks user as "known practitioner"

## Bullet-Counter Mechanics (Locked Rules)

### What Works

**Physical cover**: Walls, crates, furniture

**Technique combinations**:
* Wire-Ear (hear approach) + Fear-Cut (stay calm) + Steady-Hand (return fire)
* False-Step (induce miss) + counter-fire
* Mirror-Stance (in melee range) + disarm/control

### What Does NOT Work

❌ **Deflecting bullets with gestures** (this is not Star Wars)

❌ **Sustained invulnerability shields**

❌ **Long-range precision disruption** (range limit: five paces)

### Armor and Protection

Standard protection methods still apply:
* Heavy coats (limited protection)
* Cover and concealment
* Distance and terrain
* Numerical superiority

Somatic tuning provides **timing advantage**, not invulnerability.

## Duel Formats and Social Contexts

### Formal Challenge Duel

* Witnessed by arbitrator
* Standard Enclave protocol rules
* Signal Pale environment controlled
* Legal consequences managed

### Ambush

* No witnesses preferred
* Environmental surprise advantage
* Technique use may go unnoticed
* Cleanup and disposal concerns

### Corridor Enforcement

* Close quarters
* Multiple opponents common
* Sustained technique use impossible
* Terrain knowledge critical

### Rooftop/Open Exchange

* Distance advantages
* Wind and weather factors
* Technique unreliability in poor Signal environment
* Marksmanship dominates

## Training and Recognition

### How Practitioners Identify Each Other

* Characteristic posture
* Finger placement habits
* Breath control visibility
* Gaze steadiness
* Fingertip calluses

### How to Spot a Latchhand in Public

* Excessive stillness (conserving energy)
* Habitual hand positioning
* Environmental scanning patterns
* Proximity to Signal Pale sources (telegraph stations, etc.)

### Novice vs. Master in Combat

**Novice**:
* Obvious technique tells
* Single-technique reliance
* High cost, low efficiency
* Panic under pressure

**Master**:
* Minimal visible tells
* Seamless chaining
* Efficient cost management
* Calm under sustained threat
