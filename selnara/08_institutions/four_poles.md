# Institutional Structures — The Four Poles

## Core Principle (LOCKED)

Selnara does **not have a unified government or empire**.

Instead, power is distributed across **four institutional poles** that compete, cooperate, and conflict:

1. **Standard Enclaves** (neutral treaty-ports with hardware-enforced boundaries)
2. **Seal Syndics** (authentication cartels that control commerce legitimacy)
3. **Spine Brokers** (charging facility monopolists who control energy access)
4. **Neutral Piers** (arbitrator networks that adjudicate disputes when law is absent)

## 1) Standard Enclaves

### What They Are

**Hardware-bordered neutral treaty zones** within larger cities where:

* Multiple nations/factions are guaranteed access
* Internal security is enforced by local protocol
* Violence is suppressed by institutional weight (insurance loss, seal revocation)

### Key Features

**Physical Boundaries**:
* Walls, gates, inspection posts
* Signal Pale detection coils at entry points
* Gear mark checkpoints

**Protocol Enforcement**:
* Weapons checked or sealed at gates
* Disputes referred to Neutral Piers
* Seal Syndics verify all transactions

**Economic Function**:
* Trade safe zones
* Warehouse districts
* Telegraph hubs
* Diplomatic meeting grounds

### Social Dynamics

* **Inside**: "Civilization" operates; contracts matter; reputation is currency
* **Outside**: Frontier rules; violence is common; law is delayed or absent

### Famous Standard Enclaves

* **Selmara Central Enclave** (coastal trade hub)
* **Kharras Ring Enclave** (pit-territory neutral ground)
* **Tulwarda Lock Enclave** (river-corridor gate)

### How They Work in Stories

* **Safe Haven**: Characters retreat to Enclave for protection
* **Social Restraint**: Violence impossible inside; negotiations only
* **Boundary Tension**: Action erupts at gates or just outside walls
* **Seal Counterfeit**: Black market operates at Enclave edges

## 2) Seal Syndics

### What They Are

**Cartel networks that authenticate goods, contracts, and identities** using proprietary seal marks that are:

* Difficult to forge
* Costly to obtain
* Revocable as punishment

### Key Functions

**Commodity Authentication**:
* Verify Charged Pale quality
* Certify extraction origin
* Validate barrel integrity

**Contract Enforcement**:
* Witness agreements
* Provide arbitration stamps
* Revoke seals for breach

**Identity Documentation**:
* Issue travel papers
* Verify bloodline/clan claims
* Mark criminals with revoked seals

### Social Dynamics

* **Reputation System**: Seals represent trustworthiness
* **Exclusion as Weapon**: No seal = no legitimate trade
* **Corruption Pressure**: Bribes to seal unclean goods
* **Counterfeit Markets**: Forged seals = underground economy

### Seal Types

**Transit Seal**: Permits travel through corridors

**Commodity Seal**: Certifies Pale quality and origin

**Contract Seal**: Validates witnessed agreements

**Bloodline Seal**: Proves family claim to territories/rights

### How They Work in Stories

* **Investigation**: Verify counterfeit seal trail
* **Social Leverage**: Threaten seal revocation
* **Corruption Arc**: Syndic takes bribe, legitimizes crime
* **Reputation Drama**: Character loses seal, becomes untouchable

## 3) Spine Brokers

### What They Are

**Monopolists who control access to charging facilities** (where Grey Current is transferred to Pale Medium).

Because Spine sites are:
* Geographically fixed (ridge lines, storm belts)
* Infrastructure-heavy (skyframes, manifolds)
* Strategically critical (bottleneck for all power)

...whoever controls them controls **charging time as a commodity**.

### Key Functions

**Charging Access**:
* Allocate time slots ("minutes on the manifold")
* Set rates (variable by demand, weather, favoritism)
* Grant or deny access to competitors

**Extraction Coordination**:
* Manage skyframe deployment
* Schedule jar bank rotations
* Control weather forecasting intelligence

**Hold-Up Tactics**:
* Delay rivals' charging windows
* Extort higher fees during storms
* Threaten to cut access entirely

### Social Dynamics

* **Bottleneck Power**: Control the charging = control the economy
* **Weather as Weapon**: Forecasting intelligence = market advantage
* **Corruption and Favoritism**: Political allies get priority
* **Violence at Margins**: Theft, sabotage, claim jumping

### Famous Spine Broker Houses

* **The Girven Compact** (old ridge-town alliance)
* **Shethassa Storm Lords** (desert shear monopolists)
* **Kharras Terrace Brokers** (pit-country charging rings)

### How They Work in Stories

* **Economic Conflict**: Rival factions compete for charging time
* **Sabotage**: Destroy skyframes to cripple enemy
* **Hold-Up Drama**: Pay extortion or lose power supply
* **Weather Heist**: Steal forecast to pre-position charging

## 4) Neutral Piers

### What They Are

**Arbitrator networks** that provide adjudication when:

* Multiple factions claim the same territory/resource
* Contracts are disputed
* Violence threatens trade stability
* Standard Enclaves need neutral enforcement

### Key Functions

**Dispute Resolution**:
* Hear evidence from all parties
* Issue binding rulings
* Enforce through reputation/insurance leverage

**Contract Arbitration**:
* Interpret ambiguous agreements
* Assess damages
* Recommend compensation

**Intelligence Brokerage**:
* Maintain records of past rulings
* Track reputation across regions
* Sell precedent research to clients

### Social Dynamics

* **Reputation as Currency**: Neutral Piers are only valuable if trusted
* **Violence as Last Resort**: Rulings backed by "you'll never trade again" threat
* **Corruption Risk**: Arbitrators who take bribes lose all future business
* **Frontier Limits**: Cannot arrive in time for fast-moving crises

### How They Work in Stories

* **Investigation Support**: Hire Pier to research precedent
* **Trial Scene**: Present evidence to arbitrator panel
* **Reputation Destruction**: Pier rules against character publicly
* **Timing Drama**: Pier arrives too late; crisis already erupted

## How the Four Poles Interact

### Cooperation Scenarios

* **Standard Enclave**: Neutral Piers arbitrate; Seal Syndics authenticate; Spine Brokers supply power
* **Trade Stability**: All four benefit from reducing violence
* **Shared Intelligence**: Weather forecasts, seal registries, reputation records

### Conflict Scenarios

* **Seal Counterfeiting**: Syndics vs. smugglers; Enclaves enforce, Piers judge
* **Charging Extortion**: Brokers vs. Syndics; Piers mediate or side with power
* **Enclave Violations**: Local factions vs. Enclave protocol; Piers adjudicate after bloodshed

### Frontier Breakdown

When distance/speed exceeds institutional reach:

* Standard Enclaves don't exist
* Seals are meaningless (no one to verify)
* Spine Brokers are local warlords
* Neutral Piers never arrive

**Result**: Violence becomes default; law is privatized; boom/bust cycles

## Design Use Across Story Types

### Port Noir (Standard Enclave as Setting)

* Syndic corruption (counterfeit seal markets)
* Pier investigations (who broke protocol?)
* Enclave boundary tension (violence erupts at gates)

### Frontier Violence (Spine Broker Territory)

* Charging time wars
* Sabotage and claim jumping
* Weather heist operations

### Corridor Crisis (Neutral Pier Arrival Drama)

* Dispute resolution too late
* Precedent research vs. immediate need
* Ruling enforcement through reputation destruction

### Ecology Horror (Institutional Failure)

* All four poles fail to contain outbreak
* Profit motive delays cleanup
* Blame is adjudicated after deaths
