# High Concept and Aesthetic Targets

## Core Pitch

A **non-Earth** setting with an **1860s–1880s technology baseline** (gaslamp / steam / early electrification as industrial luxury), told in a **neo-noir arcane-punk** mode that can support:

* **frontier extraction violence** (the "western" feel without US/England tropes)
* **gaslit port-city rot and syndicate noir**
* **river-and-desert corridor chokepoint politics**
* an **Alien-style horror vibe** driven by containment failure, industrial labyrinths, and ecology that colonizes infrastructure

## The "Western Vibe" Without Western Nouns

The frontier feel comes from **structure**, not vocabulary:

* distance kills
* scarcity is enforced by geography
* protection is privatized
* law arrives late (or never)
* bargaining happens at gunpoint when arbitration cannot arrive in time
* boom/bust settlements form around extraction and power nodes

## The "From Hell / Alien Vibe"

* soot, fog, cramped corridors, bilges, crawlspaces, vent runs, maintenance hatches
* respectable cruelty: "protocols" used as both safety and social weapon
* bio-industrial horror where **systems behave like predators** and **habits become rails**

## World Name and Language

### World Name (LOCKED)

**Selnara**

* Fossilized from **sel** (saltwind/coast) + **nar** (river/flowway) + **-a** (old realm ending)
* Common demonym: **Selnari**

### Language Name (LOCKED)

**Selnara** (the Selnara tongue)

All place names, rivers, countries/polities, major factions, and (when desired) personal names follow Selnara naming rules.

## What This World is Built to Support

* Standalone noir thriller in Selmara's Standard Enclave wars (counterfeit Charged Pale, Signal drift killings, seal syndics)
* Pit frontier feud in Kharras/Vethgoro with vertical gunfights and nest ecology awakening
* River lockwork containment crisis at Tulwarda: blockade vs spread choice, quarantine violence, corridor starvation dilemmas
* Multiple unrelated stories in the same world: ports, pits, lockworks, desert depots, ridge spines, corridor caravans

## What is Explicitly NOT Part of the Setting (LOCKED EXCLUSIONS)

* Earth setting labels and direct Earth place identities (this is not the US/England; not "sheriffs/marshals," not "Whitechapel" literally)
* Free-standing wizardry, spell schools, prophecy systems, or fate templates as the core engine
* Bureaucracy-as-magic interface (no ledger/registry/clerical metaphysics as the main mechanism)
* Bullet-immunity superhero combat; rigs only **steal timing/line/position** in short, costly windows
