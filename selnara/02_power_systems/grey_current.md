# Grey Current

## What It Is

A persistent atmospheric **electrostatic flow** along ridge-lines and storm shearbelts.

Not lightning. More like a steady "charge wind" that becomes lethal when disturbed.

## Where It Lives

* Stormspines and ridge chains
* Moving shearbelts with spike events
* Valleys/hollows where it drains and weakens

## How It's Harvested (Period-Appropriate)

**Skyframes**: kite-lattices, wire fans, ceramic insulators, glass charge jars

### Key Components

* **Kite-lattices**: Aerial structures that catch charge flow
* **Wire fans**: Conductive arrays that channel current
* **Ceramic insulators**: Prevent discharge and ground leakage
* **Glass charge jars**: Storage vessels for captured current

## Characteristics

* Grey Current in jars is **unstable and short-lived**
* Cannot be transported long distances
* Requires immediate transfer to Pale Medium
* Capture efficiency varies with weather conditions

## Key Rule (LOCKED)

Grey Current is **capture power**, not a transport fuel.

It must be transferred to Pale Medium at Spine facilities for storage and transport.

## Hazards

* Discharge events during harvesting
* Equipment failure in storms
* Worker electrocution
* Jar rupture and cascade failures
* Shear spike unpredictability

## Economic Impact

* Skyframe placement = territorial control
* Charging time = commodity ("minutes on the manifold")
* Spine Brokers control access
* Hold-up problems at bottleneck sites
* Weather forecasting = strategic intelligence
