# Selnara Worldbuilding Project

## Overview

**Selnara** is a neo-noir arcane-punk worldbuilding project set in a non-Earth world with an 1860s–1880s technology baseline. The world supports port noir, frontier violence, corridor crisis, and bio-industrial horror storytelling.

## Core Identity

* **Genre**: Neo-noir arcane-punk, gaslamp horror
* **Tech Level**: 1860s–1880s (steam, gas lamps, telegraph, revolvers)
* **Power System**: Grey Current + Pale Medium → Charged Pale (energy commodity)
* **"Magic"**: Somatic Tuning (latchhands) — physical skill, not spell-casting
* **Creatures**: Bio-industrial parasites that colonize infrastructure
* **Politics**: Four institutional poles (no unified empire)

## What This World is Built For

* Standalone noir thriller in treaty-port cities
* Pit frontier feuds with vertical gunfights
* River lockwork containment crises
* Bio-industrial horror outbreaks
* Duel-based personal combat with "timing theft" mechanics

## Completion Status

### ✅ Fully Documented (95%+)

* Core identity and high concept
* Power systems (Grey Current, Pale Medium, industrial chain)
* Somatic tuning mechanics and technique catalog
* Combat system (personal circuits)
* Creature ecology (four families)
* Institutional structures (four poles)
* Conlang system and naming rules
* Geographic logic and major locations

### ⚠️ Partially Complete (50–80%)

* Individual location details beyond major cities
* Minor faction profiles
* Historical timeline depth
* Character name catalogs
* Story outlines and scenarios

### ❌ Not Yet Started (0–25%)

* Visual reference gathering
* Map illustrations
* NPC databases
* Session/story logs
* Gameplay mechanics adaptation

## Worldbuilding-Only Completion: 85%

**Core systems are locked and comprehensive**. Remaining work is expansion into:
* Minor locations
* Secondary characters
* Story scenarios
* Supplementary lore

## Recent Changes

* **2024-12**: Full extraction from single overview file into organized category structure
* 10 category directories created with detailed documentation files
* All core systems documented with locked design elements
* Gazetteer completed with 8 major locations and story hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Location Details**: Add minor cities and settlements to gazetteer
2. **Faction Profiles**: Detail Seal Syndic houses, Spine Broker families
3. **Historical Events**: Expand timeline with key wars, outbreaks, treaties
4. **Character Names**: Build catalog of example characters with backstories
5. **Story Scenarios**: Create detailed scenario templates for each story mode
