## Metaphysical Skeleton of the World

### The Living Pattern

Every person and major institution carries a **Living Pattern**: not “destiny,” but a continuously updating record of constraints and tendencies—creditworthiness, opportunity access, reputational inertia, and liability. The Pattern is **not a timeline**. It is a **state vector**: a ledgered portrait of what is currently feasible, insurable, believable, and socially frictionless. Patterns are interpretable, and interpretation is a market: forged readings, cosmetic edits, and strategic misreads are normal crimes of state.

### Pattern Residue (death-fuel) + Alchemy (refining)

Death releases **Pattern Residue**—cheap, high-yield metaphysical energy. **Alchemy** refines it into usable arcane-punk formats (cells, inks, catalysts, scrubbers) that power industry, infrastructure, and high-output rites. Residue is also pollution: it increases systemic brittleness, pushes risk into the tails, makes minds noisier, and corrodes measurement—unless scrubbed. Residue provides **wattage** (scale and speed), but it does **not** waive the core costs of any magic system.

### The Commons Ledger (externalities can’t be dodged)

There is an impersonal accounting layer—call it the **Commons Ledger**—that records offloaded costs. When unpaid, Ledger entries “bloom” into public bads: corrosion events, epidemic weirdness, infrastructure failures, sudden violence, institutional breakdown. Ledger debts leave **receipts**—trace marks (rust-patterns, blight signatures, audit flags, behavioral drift) that can be tracked, litigated, forged, planted, or traded. This is the world’s hard law: **no private gain without public consequence.**

### Admissibility (knowability has constraints)

Some truths can be known cleanly; others cannot. When conditions for clean knowledge aren’t met, the world only permits **bounds** (“between X and Y”) or rejects a claim as inadmissible. This constraint applies to **knowledge claims** and can also constrain certain magical outcomes that depend on inference or certification. Admissibility is not policy. It is the universe’s epistemic spine. Institutions can enforce compliance, punish misuse, and exploit loopholes—but they cannot change admissibility itself.

### Attention is finite and real

Attention isn’t just psychology—it’s a **scarce substrate** that affects what people can integrate, remember, and coordinate around. A society can be made cognitively poor without lowering intelligence; it loses bandwidth for sustained thought, nuance, grief, and civic memory. When grief is stolen, the loss is not merely emotional—it erodes **collective remembrance** and moral learning.

> Ministries may exist as political institutions that regulate, license, and prosecute abuses around these layers, but the layers themselves are **metaphysical facts**. Magic is a separate “black physics” that exploits them.

## The Five Magic Systems (separate from ministries, shaped by the same reality)

Each system is a **technology of constraint manipulation**. None requires future-echo logic. Each has a distinct “payment texture,” leaves distinct receipts in the Commons Ledger, and can be scaled by Pattern Residue—but never cost-free.

# 1) Variancecraft (econometrics-flavored)

**What it does:** Compresses uncertainty locally—tightens dispersion, increases reliability, reduces randomness around outcomes that are already plausible.

**Core constraint:** Variancecraft cannot choose exact outcomes from nothing. It alters **dispersion and tail weight** around feasible outcomes; it cannot conjure impossibility.

**Locked costs**

* **Tail Transfer:** the variance you remove reappears as *tail risk* elsewhere—rare disasters become more frequent somewhere you didn’t protect.
* **Outlier Culling:** reality pays by pruning “exceptions”—people, projects, organisms, or institutions that sit in the tails get clipped.

**How it looks in-world:** Clean miracles with statistical rot behind them. A factory never fails—until a distant neighborhood starts collapsing in freak clusters. A sharpshooter never misses—until unrelated innocents become the outliers reality chooses to prune.

**Typical uses:** reliability hacks, never-miss shots, “accident-proof” engineering, surgical certainty, market manipulation, logistics perfection.

**Signature receipts:** clusters of freak events, uncanny streaks of “impossible luck,” and an uptick in sudden expulsions/deaths of the weird, fragile, or brilliant—plus visible tail-bloom patterns in the Ledger.

**Built-in counterplay:** force variance back in (noise injection), build redundancy and distributed slack, or redirect tail risk into controlled sinks (a villain’s favorite; a hero’s last resort).

**Residue interface:** Residue powers “certainty presses” and industrial stabilization rigs, increasing scale and speed—but tail transfer and culling remain mandatory.

---

# 2) Incentive Hexing (mechanism design / game theory)

**What it does:** Doesn’t force behavior directly. It rewires payoffs so the desired behavior becomes the equilibrium—truth-telling, compliance, cooperation, betrayal, deterrence, allocation—depending on the mechanism written.

**Core constraint:** The outcome must be **implementable**: incentives, monitoring, and enforcement must be coherent. If the mechanism can’t hold, the hex collapses into reversion dynamics.

**Locked costs**

* **Collateral Binding:** the penalty clause is anchored to **innocent third parties**. Stability demands real collateral.
* **Punishment Escrow:** the hex requires a **pre-funded punishment pool** that pays out *regardless* of whether anyone defects. Even perfect compliance still bleeds—because credibility must be continuously “real.”

**Escrow discharge rule:** The mechanism specifies a payout order such as **defector → collateral → commons draw**. If no defection occurs, the escrow still disburses according to its fallback rule, producing “wasted punishment” that keeps the threat credible.

**How it looks in-world:** Contracts that feel like gravity. People “choose” the desired action because deviation becomes metaphysically expensive and predictably punished.

**Typical uses:** treaties that hold, corruption-resistant procurement, forced honesty compacts, stable deterrence, allocation mechanisms, non-bribable bureaucratic procedures.

**Signature receipts:** collateral marks on bound innocents, periodic escrow disbursements during peace, enforcement “clicks” in social behavior, and violent reversion-path outcomes when a hex breaks.

**Built-in counterplay:** attack or redirect escrow, break monitoring, undermine credibility, or create strategic ambiguity that yields multiple equilibria (making the mechanism non-unique and unstable).

**Residue interface:** Residue powers seals, vaults, penalty automata, and enforcement infrastructure, scaling reach—but collateral binding and escrow remain mandatory.

# 3) Attention Butchery (behavioral econ + cognitive science; bardic in vibe)

**What it does:** Uses performance, story, ritual, and synchronization to harvest attention and reshape what people can perceive, integrate, and coordinate around.

**Core constraint:** Attention Butchery cannot create new knowledge. It reallocates **salience, context, integration bandwidth, and memory formation**—what is noticed, what is ignored, what can be held together.

**Locked costs**

* **Attention Tithes:** every working consumes measurable “attention-years” siphoned from individuals or crowds.
* **Grief Theft:** big miracles can be powered by stealing a population’s ability to mourn—turning loss into numb efficiency and eroding civic memory.

**How it looks in-world:** Songs that make a crowd overlook armed men. Stories that make a scandal unforgettable. Chants that flatten nuance until only one action feels possible. Silence-rituals that restore bandwidth at great cost.

**Typical uses:** mass persuasion, stealth-by-neglect, panic induction, memetic obedience, context erasure, rendering certain facts “too boring to see,” crowd coordination.

**Signature receipts:** shortened attention spans, civic amnesia, simplified language, compulsive ritual consumption, emotionally “thin” districts, and Ledger marks consistent with stolen mourning.

**Built-in counterplay:** slow-attention sanctuaries, ritual firebreaks of silence, redundant public grieving practices, and community “context braids” that preserve integration against harvest.

**Residue interface:** Residue powers broadcast rigs, resonance lantern arrays, and amplification stages, scaling harvest and reach—but the tithe and grief costs remain mandatory.

# 4) Trait Theft (psychometrics + psychology)

**What it does:** Extracts, transfers, or suppresses latent traits—impulse control, empathy calibration, threat sensitivity, grit, dominance, compliance—treating people as decomposable into measurable parameters.

**Core constraint:** Trait Theft changes **capacity** (the parameters of mind). It is distinct from Attention Butchery, which changes **allocation** (bandwidth and rendering). Traits must be made measurable, separable, and transferable.

**Locked costs**

* **Calibration Trials:** extraction requires extended measurement under engineered stressors—validity purchased with suffering.
* **Invariance Break:** to transfer traits across contexts, the system forces standardization. Cultural and individual variation gets flattened so the trait behaves “the same” everywhere.

**How it looks in-world:** Clinics and labs, not wizard towers. Subjects are pushed through standardized lives until the trait is statistically separable, then siphoned. Recipients become optimized—and less human in specific ways.

**Typical uses:** manufacturing fearless soldiers, creating docile workforces, renting charisma, buying “grit,” laundering conscience, suppressing empathy in interrogators, injecting patience into administrators.

**Signature receipts:** instrument scars (self-monitoring tics, dissociative gaps), flattened affect, identity erosion, and social monocultures where people begin reacting the same way across contexts.

**Built-in counterplay:** sabotage validity, protect cultural variance, foster communities that resist standardization, and create environments where traits do not transfer cleanly.

**Residue interface:** Residue powers chambers, stimulants, compliance rigs, and transfer apparatus, scaling throughput—but calibration and invariance costs remain mandatory.

---

# 5) Confounding Rot (anti-econometrics / epistemic sabotage)

**What it does:** Doesn’t change outcomes directly; it changes whether outcomes can ever be cleanly attributed, learned from, or proven. It weaponizes the limits of inference.

**Core constraint:** Rot targets **knowability infrastructure**—the tools and categories that allow a society to learn. It produces durable contamination, not one-off deception.

**Locked costs**

* **Instrument Burn:** you must destroy or permanently corrupt a specific, real causal lever—trusted tests, stable records, reliable markers, clean discontinuities, validated procedures. This is not abstract “truth”; it is a named instrument the society relied upon.
* **Label-Swap Tithe:** you must inject systematic, durable misclassification—diagnoses, ledgers, causes, categories swapped in a way that persists and creates enduring measurement error.
* **Optional: Confounder Seeding:** you make a new hidden common cause *real*—a rumor ecology, parasite, microclimate, supply-chain quirk—that now links variables and keeps generating spurious associations after the caster is gone.

**How it looks in-world:** The most terrifying magic for states and criminals. After a Rot event, courts can’t convict, medicine can’t evaluate, engineers can’t diagnose, and reforms can’t prove they worked. Everyone argues from vibes because the instruments are ash.

**Typical uses:** unprovable assassinations, permanent plausible deniability, destroying institutional legitimacy, making a region “truth-hostile,” protecting corruption by making evaluation impossible.

**Signature receipts:** admissibility dead zones, contradictory evidence storms, policy evaluation failure, persistent category drift, and Ledger receipts consistent with instrument ash and label corruption.

**Built-in counterplay:** slow reconstruction—new instruments, new standards, re-grounded observation rituals, and painful reclassification campaigns. Rot is easier to cast than to clean.

**Residue interface:** Residue acts as an accelerant and carrier—spreading rot farther and making it stickier—but it cannot substitute for the mandatory burns and tithes.

## Metaphysical “Species” (ecology of consequences)

To make the world feel alive, each system interacts with a metaphysical ecology—neither gods nor ministries. These entities do not run magic; they are **the ecological consequence and enforcement layer** that makes costs inevitable and legible. They proliferate near **Residue use** and **Ledger debt**, like pests near a granary.

* **Variancecraft fauna:** *Tailmoths* (carry misfortune), *Outlier Reapers* (prune extremes). Their migrations map tail transfer and culling pressure.
* **Incentive Hexing fauna:** *Surety Wights* (mark collateral), *Escrow Hounds* (ensure punishment disburses on schedule). Starved systems produce random enforcement events.
* **Attention Butchery fauna:** *Chorus Leeches* (feed on synchronized focus), *Grief Collectors* (harvest mourning capacity). They leave districts emotionally thin and civically forgetful.
* **Trait Theft fauna:** *Factor Weevils* (separate traits under stress), *Standardizers* (flatten variance so transfer “works”). Their presence predicts invariance break.
* **Confounding Rot fauna:** *Instrument Ashers* (burn standards), *Label Imps* (swap categories), and optional *Third-Cause Larvae* (seeded confounders that persist and spread).
