# World Overview and Correlation to the Big Five Concepts

## World Overview

This world is built on a metaphysical skeleton where economic, psychological, and epistemic principles are the literal laws of reality. Every person and institution carries a Living Pattern—a dynamic record of constraints, tendencies, and liabilities. Fate is not fixed, but is continuously interpreted and traded in a market of readings, forgeries, and cosmetic edits. Death releases Pattern Residue, a potent but polluting energy that powers industry, magic, and contracts, but always at a cost to the commons.

The Commons Ledger is an impersonal accounting layer that tracks all offloaded costs. Unpaid debts bloom into public bads: corrosion, cognitive blight, institutional rot, and sudden violence. Admissibility is a metaphysical constraint—some truths can be known, others only bounded, and some are forever inadmissible. Attention is a finite, real substrate, shaping what can be remembered, coordinated, and grieved. Ministries regulate these layers, but the layers themselves are metaphysical facts, not mere policy.

Magic exploits these constraints through five distinct systems, each with its own payment texture and ecological consequences:

## Correlation to the Big Five Concepts

### 1. Econometrics (Variancecraft & Confounding Rot)
- **Variancecraft** compresses uncertainty, making outcomes reliable but shifting risk elsewhere. It is powered by Pattern Residue, which enables industrial-grade certainty presses, but the statistical bill must still be paid—tail risks and outlier culling become mechanized and targetable. The world’s metaphysical ecology includes Tailmoths and Outlier Reapers, which enforce these costs.
- **Confounding Rot** weaponizes the limits of inference, destroying instruments and injecting misclassification. Pattern Residue acts as an accelerant, spreading epistemic sabotage farther and deeper. Instrument Ashers and Label Imps are ecological consequences, making truth hostile and policy evaluation unreliable.

### 2. Behavioral Economics (Attention Butchery)
- **Attention Butchery** manipulates attention and grief as real, harvestable resources. Performances, rituals, and stories powered by Residue can reshape what people perceive and coordinate around, but always at the cost of attention-years and civic memory. Chorus Leeches and Grief Collectors feed on these events, leaving cities emotionally thin and cognitively poor.

### 3. Game Theory / Mechanism Design (Incentive Hexing)
- **Incentive Hexing** rewires payoffs so desired behaviors become equilibrium. Pattern Residue powers enforcement infrastructure—seals, escrow vaults, penalty automata—but collateral binding and punishment escrow remain mandatory. Surety Wights and Escrow Hounds enforce these contracts, and the system’s stability depends on real, painful costs.

### 4. Psychometrics / Psychology (Trait Theft)
- **Trait Theft** extracts, transfers, or suppresses latent traits through measurement and standardization. Pattern Residue powers clinics and compliance rigs, but calibration trials and invariance breaks are still required. Factor Weevils and Standardizers flatten variance and predict identity erosion, creating social monocultures and optimized but less human recipients.

### 5. Epistemology / Identification (Admissibility & Confounding Rot)
- **Admissibility** is a metaphysical constraint: only some truths can be known cleanly, others are bounded, and some are inadmissible. Confounding Rot further sabotages identification, making reliable knowledge rare and costly. The Ministry of Proof and its ecological agents (Instrument Ashers, Label Imps) police what counts as knowledge, ensuring that epistemic rigor is enforced and easy prophecy denied.

## Coherence and Setting

Pattern Residue can power scale and speed, but never waives a system’s core cost. The metaphysical ecology—industrial spirits, pollution phenomena, and enforcement fauna—makes every cost visible and inevitable. The world’s institutions, magic, and social order are shaped by these five academic pillars, ensuring that every story, conflict, and innovation is grounded in constraint, consequence, and the struggle to balance private gain with public cost.
