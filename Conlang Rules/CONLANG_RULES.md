# Conlang Construction Rules

## Overview

This document defines the systematic process for creating vocabulary in the constructed language (conlang) for the Dartboard world. Every word must pass through this complete process to ensure consistency and linguistic authenticity.

## Step 1: Three-Language Foundation

Each word is built using three real-world languages in distinct roles:

### 1.1 Root Language (Base)

**Purpose**: Provides the semantic foundation for the word.

**Process**:
- Identify the concept to be named
- Find the translation in the designated Root Language
- The root can be derived from:
  - **Direct translation**: The literal word for the concept
  - **Metaphorical translation**: A word/phrase that captures the essence metaphorically
  - **Symbolic translation**: A word representing symbolic association with the concept
  - **Synonymous translation**: A related word or synonym that carries appropriate connotations

**Output**: A root word or root phrase

### 1.2 Affix Language (Emphasis)

**Purpose**: Creates affixes that modify and emphasize the root word, adding flavor and nuance.

**Process**:
- Use the same root concept (not the translated word from 1.1)
- Find the translation in the designated Affix Language
- Derive an affix (prefix or suffix) from this translation
- **Critical Rule**: Create multiple affix variations for each root concept to avoid repetitive endings and create linguistic variety

**Affix Variations Should Include**:
- At least 2-3 suffix options per common concept
- At least 1-2 prefix options where appropriate
- Shortened forms for compound words
- Formal vs. informal variants where applicable

**Output**: One or more affixes to attach to the root

### 1.3 Mutation Language (Transformation)

**Purpose**: Provides letter mutation rules to transform the combined root+affix into something new.

**Process**:
- Take the combined root+affix word
- Apply letter mutations based on the Mutation Language's phonetic patterns
- **Critical Rule**: Every word must have AT LEAST TWO letters mutated

**Mutation Types**:
- Vowel shifts (a→e, i→u, etc.)
- Consonant shifts (k→g, t→d, s→z, etc.)
- Letter additions
- Letter substitutions based on Mutation Language phonetics

**Output**: A mutated word that feels distinct from both source languages

## Step 2: Molting (Temporal Compression)

**Purpose**: Simulate natural linguistic evolution—how an ancient, archaic word would condense over centuries of common use.

**Process**:
- Assume the Step 1 output is an "Old Form" of the word
- Apply compression as if the word has been spoken for generations:
  - Remove redundant syllables
  - Blend consonant clusters
  - Drop unstressed vowels
  - Simplify repeated sounds
  - Shorten overly long words (target: 1-3 syllables for common words)

**Principles**:
- High-frequency words compress more
- Formal/ritual words may retain longer forms
- Technical terms compress less than everyday vocabulary

**Output**: A "Modern Form" of the word

## Step 3: Enunciation (Readability)

**Purpose**: Ensure the final word is simple to pronounce for English-speaking readers.

**Process**:
- Review the molted word for pronunciation clarity
- Apply adjustments:
  - Break up unpronounceable consonant clusters
  - Ensure vowel placement allows natural flow
  - Avoid sounds that don't exist in English (or provide clear approximations)
  - Test by reading aloud—if you stumble, simplify

**Guidelines**:
- Prefer open syllables (consonant + vowel) where possible
- Avoid more than two consonants in sequence
- Ensure stress patterns are intuitive
- The word should be pronounceable on first read

**Output**: The final word, ready for use

## Complete Process Checklist

For every word converted:

- [ ] **Root**: Found translation/metaphor/symbol in Root Language
- [ ] **Affix**: Created affix from Affix Language (with variations documented)
- [ ] **Mutation**: Applied 2+ letter mutations from Mutation Language
- [ ] **Molting**: Compressed to simulate linguistic evolution
- [ ] **Enunciation**: Confirmed easy pronunciation for readers

---

## Documentation Format

When creating new words, document as follows:

```
CONCEPT: [English word/concept]

ROOT LANGUAGE:
- Translation: [word]
- Type: [direct/metaphorical/symbolic/synonymous]
- Root selected: [root]

AFFIX LANGUAGE:
- Translation: [word]
- Affix created: [affix]
- Variations: [list alternatives]

MUTATION LANGUAGE:
- Pre-mutation: [root+affix]
- Mutations applied: [list specific changes]
- Post-mutation: [result]

MOLTING:
- Old Form: [post-mutation word]
- Compression applied: [describe changes]
- Modern Form: [result]

ENUNCIATION:
- Adjustments: [describe any changes]
- Final Word: [FINAL RESULT]
- Pronunciation Guide: [phonetic guide]
```

## Language Set Selection

The three languages should be selected based on:

1. **Root Language**: Should have rich vocabulary for concepts central to the world (death, binding, fate, flesh, etc.)
2. **Affix Language**: Should have distinct phonetic character from the Root Language
3. **Mutation Language**: Should provide interesting consonant/vowel shift patterns

The selected language set should create words that feel:
- Consistent with each other (same world, same tongue)
- Distinct from real-world languages (clearly fantasy)
- Appropriate to the tone (dark fantasy, weight, consequence)
