Overview The Loom is the distributed network of devices, rituals, and institutions that read, record, and predict fate in H\u00e1lcova. It is not a single machine but a system\u2014part arcane technology, part religious practice, part bureaucratic apparatus. More importantly: The Loom may be a point of contact with Fate itself. Whether Fate is an Elsewhere entity, a collection of entities, or something stranger is a matter of fierce theological debate. What's undeniable is that The Loom works . Its predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance. And something answers when the Loom-Keepers perform their divinations. What The Loom Is The Physical Infrastructure Loom-Nodes Distributed across H\u00e1lcova, Loom-Nodes are the physical anchors of the system: Major Nodes : Large installations in capital cities and religious centers. Cathedral-sized complexes housing pattern-engines, archives, and ritual spaces. Staffed by hundreds of Loom-Keepers. Minor Nodes : Town-level facilities. Smaller pattern-engines, local registries, drawing chambers. Staffed by licensed practitioners and temple appointees. Mobile Nodes : Portable equipment for frontier regions, military operations, and emergency readings. Less accurate but functional. Private Nodes : Illegal or gray-market installations operated by wealthy individuals, corporations, and criminal organizations. Quality varies wildly. The Pattern-Engines At the heart of each Node is a pattern-engine\u2014a device that: Records S\u00f3rscad data from drawings Performs predictive calculations Communicates with other Nodes (major ones only) Interfaces with... something. The source of The Loom's impossible accuracy. Pattern-engines are part clockwork, part alchemical apparatus, part something that defies categorization. Their construction is a closely guarded secret. Their fuel is Pattern Residue\u2014the same substance that maintains echo anchors. The Institutional Structure The Loom-Keepers A guild-priesthood that operates The Loom. They are: Trained in pattern-reading, engine operation, and ritual practice Licensed by both religious and civil authorities Bound by oaths that constrain their use of Loom-knowledge Organized hierarchically from apprentices to High Weavers Loom-Keepers occupy an ambiguous social position. They're essential to Governance , commerce, and religion. They're also viewed with suspicion\u2014people who know too much about everyone else's fate. The Registry The accumulated database of all S\u00f3rscad patterns ever drawn. Stored in: Physical archives (paper, metal plates, encoded materials) Pattern-engine memory (poorly understood how this works) Distributed across major Nodes with varying levels of completeness The Registry is legally protected, politically contested, and practically impossible to fully secure. Pattern-theft, registry-manipulation, and archive-raids are all documented crimes. Calculation Houses Institutions using Loom data: actuarial houses, credit temples, merchant guilds , legal colleges, military orders. License Loom access for insurance, lending, employment, sentencing, recruitment. What The Loom Does Pattern recording: S\u00f3rscad drawn via ritual, captured, recorded, indexed, transmitted. Prediction: life-arc probabilities, decision tendencies, risk profiles, compatibility assessments. Deviation detection: minor, significant, anomalous\u2014can indicate error, environment, manipulation, or theologically troubling events. The Source: Fate as Entity Orthodox: Loom reads the Weaver's will. Heterodox: Loom's accuracy may come from Elsewhere entities, pacts, or Pattern Residue as payment. Loom-Keepers know something answers rituals but don't know what it is. The Accuracy Problem Why does it work? Fate is real, Loom reads it; Loom creates what it predicts; Elsewhere entities arrange outcomes; combination. Bias: Loom reflects historical power structures, discrimination, feedback loops. Pattern Residue: The Fuel Energy released when patterns dissolve at death. Natural sources: any death, more from trauma/heavy patterns. Manufactured: executions, blood-sport, war, plague, livestock. Used for Loom, core binding, alchemy, magitech. Economy: peace is expensive, war is profitable, disaster is opportunity. Regional Distribution Core regions: dense Loom coverage, strong Orthodoxy, pattern-privileged. Peripheral: sparse coverage, mixed religion, deviation common.

The Fundamental Problem Every political philosophy on Earth assumes a baseline: people are created equal, or they aren't, but either way you can't prove it by reading their metaphysical signature at birth. H\u00e1lcova doesn't have that luxury. The S\u00f3rscad exists. It's readable. It predicts outcomes with uncomfortable accuracy. This breaks political philosophy at its foundations and forces reconstruction from first principles. The Questions That Matter What Does \"Equality\" Mean? On Earth : Equality typically means equal moral worth, equal rights, equal standing before the law\u2014regardless of observable differences in capability or circumstance. On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support. Consent On H\u00e1lcova, the Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. Consent is complicated by prediction, manipulation, and pattern constraints.

Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects. The five magical traditions\u2014collectively called the Five Arts\u2014each represent a different answer to the question: What are you willing to pay?

Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late. Category One: Core Binding The Art of Holding the Dead Fundamental Principle When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental. The core is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned. Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't. That's the relationship. The Core Explore Related Topics World Summary Metaphysics Fate System Society Governance Planetary Conlang What It Is The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. See Metaphysics . Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete Core Binding (Echo Binding) Anchors: Physical objects housing bound echoes\u2014figurines, tiles, metal plates, bone carvings, jewelry. The anchor must depict the bound echo, either by natural manifestation or artistic creation. Binders carry as many anchors as they can transport; activation summons echoes, but too many cause resonance interference and physical drain. Upkeep: Echoes require a consumable resource to remain coherent. Resource economy includes harvesters, refiners, merchants, smugglers, and black markets. See Society . Consumption rates vary by echo complexity and awareness. Quality matters\u2014adulterated, counterfeited, aged, or fresh. Decay: Echo bleed causes phantom sensations, behavioral drift, and memory intrusion. Awareness accelerates decay. Old binders become patchworks of their echoes. Release: Possible but rare\u2014money, spite, revenge, nostalgia, love, exhaustion. Most binders hold on long past reason. Opposition: Family, religious/philosophical groups, former binders, governments. The living object; the echoes don't know they're dead. Economy: Cores are commodities. Poachers, assassins, scavengers, harvesters, brokers, appraisers, storage facilities. Wars produce inventory. Anomalies: Extracting a core from the living creates disturbing, unstable anomalies. Terminology: To be developed in conlang\u2014core, binding, echo, anchor, binder, resource, bleed. Category Two: Flesh Shaping The Art of Constructing Life Fundamental Principle Life is raw potential, waiting for the right conditions to be realized. Flesh Shaping is the art of taking this potential and giving it form. By sacrificing your own blood and meat, you can shape and animate matter, creating homunculi\u2014servants that carry out your will. The horror: each homunculus is a patchwork of materials, held together by your blood and will. They are not alive in the traditional sense; they do not grow, reproduce, or truly think. They are reflections of your own body and mind, distorted and incomplete. The Process Materials Homunculi can be made from any combination of materials: flesh, bone, clay, metal, wax, leather. The more complex the desired homunculus, the more materials and blood are required. The Spark The spark of life is your own blood, infused with your will and intent. It is what animates the homunculus, giving it the semblance of life. Without this spark, the materials remain inert, mere shapes without purpose or direction. Tethering and Conjuring Once the homunculus is formed, it must be tethered to you, its creator. This tether is a lifeline, linking the homunculus to your own life force. As long as the tether remains intact, the homunculus will obey your commands and act as your servant. However, the tether is also a vulnerability. If the homunculus is destroyed, the shock can bleed into you, causing physical and spiritual harm. Moreover, the more homunculi you have active, the weaker each tether becomes, and the greater the strain on your own body and mind.

Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. See Metaphysics . Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete","title":"Explore Related Topics"},{"location":"Halcova/magic_systems/#core-binding-echo-binding","text":"Anchors: Physical objects housing bound echoes\u2014figurines, tiles, metal plates, bone carvings, jewelry.

Consumption rates vary by echo complexity and awareness. Quality matters\u2014adulterated, counterfeited, aged, or fresh.

Physics has transaction costs. Identity is a balance sheet. Time is currency with variable exchange rates. Death is a market event. The Elsewhere is a competing market. Economic Principles Made Literal Opportunity Cost (Fate Threading): Every choice forecloses alternatives. The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take. How It Manifests : When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're harvesting the opportunity cost itself . The future they didn't choose had value\u2014stored potential\u2014and they're cashing it out. But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to you . When you harvest one: - Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path - Permanently close that path (it's been spent) - Reduce your total remaining \"decision space\" The Horror : Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic\u2014not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives. The Economic Parallel : This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. H\u00e1lcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding): People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered. How It Manifests : Core Binding creates echoes\u2014remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding. See Magic Systems . The fallacy manifests when: - The echo becomes corrupted or hostile - The echo's information becomes outdated - The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: \"I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment.\" The Horror : Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds. Explore Related Topics World Summary Magic Systems Fate System Society Governance Planetary Conlang The Structural Element : The magic system rewards sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful\u2014if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning): When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks. The Principle : Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard: - You get the power without the personal cost - Others pay the price, often without their consent - Incentives for caution or restraint are externalized How It Manifests : Entities design pacts to encourage substitution, feeding on more souls. Society creates markets for \"willing\" substitutes, insurance pools, and political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses. The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption. The Horror : The more powerful the binder, the greater the temptation to exploit this moral hazard. Entire communities can be sacrificed for the ambitions of a few. The fabric of society erodes as individuals act purely in their self-interest, insulated from the consequences. Game Theory Made Literal Prisoner's Dilemma: Individually rational choices produce collectively irrational outcomes. Entities create substitution deals so accepting is rational, but coordinated refusal would be better. Information asymmetry prevents coordination. The entity harvests not just souls but the coordination failure itself. Psychological Principles Made Literal Cognitive Dissonance: Wardens rationalize themselves into true belief through dissonance reduction. The Attunement process maximizes sacrifice and belief intensification. Doubt is experienced as weakness and suppressed. Philosophical Frameworks Made Literal Determinism vs. Free Will: The Loom predicts choices but doesn't make them. Compatibilist, hard determinist, libertarian, and pragmatist readings all coexist.

Governance and Law Political philosophy and legal frameworks are detailed in Governance . Political Philosophy Problems In a fate-real world: - What does justice mean when actions were predicted? - What does consent mean when choice may be illusory? - What legitimizes authority when the Loom could identify \"leadership patterns\"? Regional Approaches Region Legitimacy Basis Pattern in Law Warden Status Far Shelf Community autonomy Rejected Illegal Legal Tensions Pattern evidence : Admissible? Dispositive? Pre-crime intervention : Can you punish predicted-but-uncommitted crimes? Pattern-weighted sentencing : Should predicted recidivists serve longer? Residue from executions : The justice system produces fuel Society All traditions accept the Loom's accuracy. They disagree about why it works: - Orthodoxy : The Weaver assigns patterns with divine purpose - Threadists : Fate is still being created; choices participate - Hollow Saints : Fate is a prison; selling your soul is liberation - Fleshwrights : Fate is biology; transcend the meat - Colony Cults : Individual patterns are fragments of an original whole - Ancestor Speakers : The dead advise; binding is dialogue Economics The Warden Order Enforcement arm of Loom orthodoxy. Attuned to the Loom through a process that resembles a pact. Hunt deviation, manipulation, evasion. Full authority in Heartlands; contested elsewhere. - Flora : Black (polar) \u2192 purple-red (temperate) \u2192 red-orange (tropical) - Fauna : Cold-adapted, mostly Residue-avoiding, some specialized feeders - Colony organisms : Unique Residue relationship, basis for hosting magic Historical Mystery 40,000-50,000 years ago, H\u00e1lcova was warmer.
