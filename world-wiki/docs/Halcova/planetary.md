## Overview

Hálcova's landmasses are arranged around the habitable equatorial band, with two major continents and three significant landmasses forming five distinct regions. The geography tells a story—the Heartlands and Shattered Reaches were once a single continent, torn apart by some ancient catastrophe. The rift that separated them became the Narrow Sea.

## The Shattered Heartlands Theory

### The Evidence

Looking at the coastlines, the relationship is obvious:
- The ragged eastern coast of the Greater Continent matches the western edge of the Shattered Reaches
- Rock formations, mineral deposits, and fossil-equivalents continue across the gap
- The Narrow Sea is a flooded rift valley, not a true ocean basin
- Ancient ruins exist on both sides with matching architectural styles

## The Heartlands

Spine of the continent, river valleys, southern coast, northern edge. Orthodox faith, Loom integration, [trade networks](society.md). Specific nations to be developed.

## The Shattered Reaches

Fragmented island-continent, matching coast, interior highlands, fracture zone, island chains. Maritime character, city-states, merchant leagues.

## The Middle Waters

Volcanic archipelago, caldera, reef systems, thermal vents. Warmest region, contested territory, colony cults, religious diversity.

## The Vent Lands

Continental fragment, volcanic activity, fire range, thermal valleys, steam fields, sulfur flats. Geothermal independence, trade federation, fleshwright guilds.

## The Far Shelf

Large, flat, cold continent, southern ice edge, mineral ranges, tundra. Frontier character, indigenous confederacies, religious heterodoxy.

## The Seas

Narrow Sea (rift valley), Central Ocean (thermal loop), Vent Strait (geothermal channel), Far Water (cold crossing), Bitter Crossing (polar route).

## The Polar Regions

Northern Cap (The Wound): Elsewhere connection, Köd bleed, ancient ruins. Southern Cap (The Prison): containment, engineered cold, ancient structures. Expeditions find evidence of contact and imprisonment.

## Ocean Currents: The Great Thermal Loop

Surface currents (warm), regional branches, deep currents (cold), seasonal variations. Further documentation needed on coastline details, current speeds, submarine geology, maritime culture.
