Hálcova isn't a world with an economy. Hálcova **is** an economy. The metaphysical substrate of reality operates on the same principles that govern markets, decisions, and resource allocation. This isn't metaphor—it's the literal structure of how existence functions here. See also [World Summary](world_summary.md), [Magic Systems](magic_systems.md), [Fate System](fate_system.md), [Society](society.md), [Governance](governance.md), [Planetary](planetary.md), and [Conlang](conlang.md).

Physics has transaction costs. Identity is a balance sheet. Time is currency with variable exchange rates. Death is a market event. The Elsewhere is a competing market.

## Economic Principles Made Literal

- Opportunity Cost (Fate Threading): Every choice forecloses alternatives. The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take.

**How It Manifests**:

When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're **harvesting the opportunity cost itself**. The future they didn't choose had value—stored potential—and they're cashing it out.

But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to *you*. When you harvest one:
- Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path
- Permanently close that path (it's been spent)
- Reduce your total remaining "decision space"

**The Horror**: Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic—not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives.

**The Economic Parallel**: This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. Hálcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit.

- Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding): People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered.

**How It Manifests**:

Core Binding creates echoes—remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding. See [Magic Systems](magic_systems.md).

The fallacy manifests when:
- The echo becomes corrupted or hostile
- The echo's information becomes outdated
- The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships

Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: "I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment."

**The Horror**: Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds.

**The Structural Element**: The magic system *rewards* sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful—if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy.

- Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning): When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks.

**The Principle**: Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard:
- You get the power without the personal cost
- Others pay the price, often without their consent
- Incentives for caution or restraint are externalized

**How It Manifests**:

Entities design pacts to encourage substitution, feeding on more souls. [Society](society.md) creates markets for "willing" substitutes, insurance pools, and political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses. The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption.

**The Horror**: The more powerful the binder, the greater the temptation to exploit this moral hazard. Entire communities can be sacrificed for the ambitions of a few. The fabric of society erodes as individuals act purely in their self-interest, insulated from the consequences.

## Game Theory Made Literal

- Prisoner's Dilemma: Individually rational choices produce collectively irrational outcomes. Entities create substitution deals so accepting is rational, but coordinated refusal would be better. Information asymmetry prevents coordination. The entity harvests not just souls but the coordination failure itself.

## Psychological Principles Made Literal

- Cognitive Dissonance: Wardens rationalize themselves into true belief through dissonance reduction. The Attunement process maximizes sacrifice and belief intensification. Doubt is experienced as weakness and suppressed.

## Philosophical Frameworks Made Literal

- Determinism vs. Free Will: The Loom predicts choices but doesn't make them. Compatibilist, hard determinist, libertarian, and pragmatist readings all coexist. Your position on free will becomes part of your pattern.

## The Elsewhere as Competing Economic System

- The Elsewhere isn't a place, but an alternative transaction framework. Scarcity, exchange, debt, and obligation operate differently. Factions represent economic philosophies: Accountants (debt), Hungry (consumption), Architects (order), Mirrors (observation), Absent (negation).

## The Loom as Attention Economy

- The Loom may allocate attention, not just predict fate. Reality requires observation to stabilize. The Attendance is the observer, and attention is finite. Getting the Loom's attention means determination, not protection.

## Summary: The Spine

Hálcova's metaphysical structure rests on:

| # | Principle | Primary Expression | Horror |
|---|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Opportunity Cost | Fate Threading | Spending your own possibilities |
| 2 | Sunk Cost Fallacy | Core Binding | Can't let go of the dead |
| 3 | Moral Hazard | Pact Summoning | Others pay your price |
| 4 | Asymmetric Information | The Loom | They know you better than you |
| 5 | Principal-Agent Problem | Warden Order | Enforcers serve themselves |
| 6 | Externalities | Residue Economy | Death's costs are socialized |
| 7 | Hyperbolic Discounting | Colony Hosting | The colony waits |
| 8 | Prisoner's Dilemma | Substitution Market | Coordination failure as harvest |
| 9 | Tragedy of Commons | Residue Harvesting | Importing death from elsewhere |
| 10 | Mechanism Design | The Loom's Origin | Someone built this trap |
| 11 | Cognitive Dissonance | Warden Attunement | Believing because you sacrificed |
| 12 | Prospect Theory | Pattern Gambling | Predictions create reference points |
| 13 | Attribution Error | Pattern Essentialism | Character vs. circumstance |
| 14 | Determinism/Free Will | Core Tension | Unfalsifiable positions |
| 15 | Ship of Theseus | Identity Erosion | No fact about continuity |
| 16 | Experience Machine | Elsewhere Temptation | Simulation vs. reality |

These aren't metaphors or themes. They're the actual mechanisms by which reality operates. Economic theory is physics. Game theory is chemistry. Psychology is biology.
