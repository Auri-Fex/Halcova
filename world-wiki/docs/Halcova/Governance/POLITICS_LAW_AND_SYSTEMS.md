# Hálcova: Politics, Law, and the Systems

## Overview

Every political system on Hálcova faces the same fundamental challenge: **the Loom exists**. The Loom reads patterns. It predicts behavior. It knows—or creates—fate. This isn't theology or philosophy. It's infrastructure. The predictions are accurate enough that ignoring them is economically irrational, and using them is morally catastrophic.

Magic makes it worse. The Five Arts let people harvest the dead, reshape bodies, trade souls, cannibalize futures, and merge with alien organisms. Every political system must answer: Who gets to use these powers? Under what constraints? With what oversight?

The answers vary. None of them work well.

## The Heartlands: Theocratic Integration

### Political Structure

The Heartlands operates as a theocratic monarchy with parallel secular and ecclesiastical authority. The Crown handles mundane governance—taxation, military, foreign policy. The Orthodox Church of the Weaver handles pattern matters—Loom access, deviation prosecution, fate certification.

In practice, nothing is cleanly divided. Pattern affects everything. A trade dispute involves pattern-certified contracts. A succession crisis requires Loom readings. A military campaign needs pattern-intelligence on enemy commanders. The Church has its fingers in every pie because pattern is in every pie.

**The Crown** maintains legitimacy through pattern-validation. The ruling family's Sórscad includes "governance fate"—the Loom predicts they'll rule, therefore they should rule. Circular logic that holds because everyone with power benefits from it holding.

**The Council of Threads** advises the Crown: major noble houses, high clergy, Warden Order representatives, selected merchants. Formally advisory. Practically, the Crown can't act against unified Council opposition.

**The Warden Order** enforces pattern-compliance. They answer to Church hierarchy but operate with significant autonomy. Their Attunement gives them abilities no one else has—pattern-sense, deviation-detection, enhanced physical capacity.

### Magic Regulation

The Heartlands doesn't ban magic. It **monopolizes** it.

**Core Binding**: Licensed and regulated. The Orthodox Church maintains binding facilities where approved practitioners create echoes under supervision. Private binding is illegal but common. The Church controls Residue distribution—want to bind? Buy your Residue from approved sources, register your binding, submit to periodic inspections.

**Flesh Shaping**: Heavily restricted. The Orthodox position is that bodies are Weaver-given; reshaping them is soft heresy. Medical applications permitted under Church supervision. Cosmetic or enhancement shaping illegal. Combat modifications are treason. Reality: thriving black market serves those with money to bribe.

**Pact Summoning**: Officially forbidden. The Elsewhere is the enemy of divine order. Pact Summoners face execution without exception. Reality: The Warden Order's Attunement looks suspiciously like a pact. Certain old families have "ancestral arrangements." The rule is: official pacts are forbidden; institutional pacts are classified.

**Fate Threading**: Capital heresy. No licenses. No exceptions. Threaders hunted with same intensity as deviants. The Warden Order has specialized units—Unravelers—trained specifically to identify and terminate Threaders.

**Colony Summoning**: Tolerated at margins, prohibited at core. Legal in frontier areas. In the Heartlands proper, hosts face significant civil disabilities—can't hold office, can't testify in Church courts, can't access certain Loom services.

### Fate System Integration

**Pattern Certification**: Required for most activities. Employment, housing, marriage, trade, travel—all require proof of pattern-reading and absence of deviation flags. Without pattern documentation, you don't legally exist.

**Pattern Evidence**: Admissible in all courts. Pattern-prediction about defendant's likely behavior can support charges, justify pre-trial detention, influence sentencing.

**Deviation as Crime**: The Heartlands criminalizes acting against your pattern's predictions. Deviation prosecution is selective—wealthy deviants negotiate rehabilitation; poor deviants face Correction.

**Pre-Crime Monitoring**: "Dangerous patterns" can be flagged for monitoring. Registration requirements. Travel restrictions. Employment limitations. Creates the outcomes it predicts.

### The Warden Order

**Jurisdiction**: Pattern-crimes anywhere the Order can reach. Deviation, fraud, evasion, interference, trafficking.

**Powers**: Detain without civilian oversight. Conduct pattern-readings without consent. Enter premises without warrant. Execute Pattern-Severance for capital pattern-crimes.

**The Attunement**: Links Wardens to the Loom. They can sense deviation, feel pattern-disturbance, detect magic use. Cost is lifespan, flexibility, and capacity for doubt.

### Law and Order

**Ecclesiastical Courts**: Handle pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy, unauthorized magic. Penalties include penance, property forfeiture, exile, and Correction (public execution producing Residue assigned to Church).

**Secular Courts**: Handle ordinary crimes. Penalties include fines, imprisonment, labor service, and execution (Residue goes to jurisdiction).

**Residue from Justice**: Executions produce Residue. Jurisdictions with shortages have higher execution rates. The legal system has financial interest in death.

## The Shattered Reaches: Fragmented Pragmatism

### Political Structure

No unified government. Dozens of city-states, island kingdoms, merchant leagues, free ports. The only commonalities are maritime orientation and contract fetishism.

**The Leagues** provide regional coordination. Amber League (Residue), Salt League (fishing), Iron League (manufacturing), Counting League (banking). Not governments, but they exercise governmental functions—currency, contract enforcement, dispute resolution.

### Magic Regulation

No unified policy. Common patterns emerge from commercial logic.

**Core Binding**: Generally legal, lightly regulated. Registration and periodic inspection. Black markets for sensitive bindings.

**Flesh Shaping**: Legal in most polities, regulated as medical practice. Guild certification required. Combat modifications restricted but available.

**Pact Summoning**: Status varies wildly. Some criminalize all pacts. Some regulate as contracts. Most prohibit involuntary substitution—creates market for "voluntary" substitution from desperate people.

**Fate Threading**: Generally unregulated. Pattern-skepticism extends to Threading.

**Colony Summoning**: Legal almost everywhere, regulated as health and safety matter.

### Fate System Integration

**Pattern Privacy**: Most polities recognize pattern as private information. Can refuse readings. Pattern discrimination prohibited in public accommodations. Reality: private parties use pattern constantly.

**Pattern Evidence**: Officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely.

**No Pre-Crime**: Punished for what you did, not what you might do. Exception: contract-based restrictions are enforceable.

### The Warden Order

Operates under bilateral treaties. Specific crimes only. Local cooperation required. No Pattern-Severance without local authorization. Defined duration.

### Law and Order

**Contract Supremacy**: Written agreements are sacred. Courts exist primarily to interpret and enforce contracts.

**Maritime Law**: Shared traditions recognized across polities.

**Arbitration**: Most disputes go to private arbiters. Faster, more expert, allows pattern evidence.

## The Middle Waters: Colonial Patchwork

### Political Structure

Not a region with a government—a region with competing governments.

**Heartlands Colonies**: Governors appointed, pattern-certified. Standard colonial administration.

**Reaches Trading Posts**: League-operated commercial enclaves. Minimal government.

**Vent Lands Footholds**: Guild-operated facilities. Governed by guild protocols.

**Native Polities**: Surviving indigenous governance—island kingdoms, elder councils, Colony Cult communities.

**Contested Zones**: Multiple powers claim authority. Governance by whoever has force present.

### Magic Regulation

Depends on who's in charge. Heartlands rules in colonies. Reaches rules in posts. Guild protocols in Vent facilities. Indigenous traditions in native polities.

Colony Cult areas treat Colony Summoning as sacred. Some native communities have Pact Summoning traditions predating Orthodox prohibition.

### Fate System Integration

Fragmented and contested. Full integration in Heartlands colonies. Optional in Reaches posts. Available but without legal weight in Vent facilities. Varies in native polities—some integrated, some resist entirely.

Native populations often understand Loom as colonizer infrastructure. Resistance to Loom is resistance to cultural imperialism.

### The Warden Order

Full jurisdiction in colonies. Claims jurisdiction elsewhere; others don't recognize it. Pursuing suspects outside colonies means requesting cooperation or military operation.

### Law and Order

Colonial law in Heartlands colonies—harsher penalties, fewer protections. Plural legal systems in contested zones. More political violence than any other region.

## The Vent Lands: Guild Technocracy

### Political Structure

**Guild Federation**: Primary guilds control critical infrastructure. Thermal Engineers maintain geothermal systems. Sulfur Extractors handle toxic operations. Flesh Shapers Consortium dominates biological industries. Makers Guild handles manufacturing. Merchants Assembly manages trade.

**Non-Guild Population**: Limited legal standing, can't access guild-controlled resources directly, depend on guild good behavior. Two-tier system with explicit hierarchy.

### Magic Regulation

Expertise-driven through guild structures.

**Core Binding**: Legal, guild-supervised. Remembrancers' Guild handles most binding.

**Flesh Shaping**: The Vent Lands specialty. Multiple competing guilds. World's leaders in shaping. Things illegal in Heartlands are routine here.

**Pact Summoning**: Not criminalized. Regulated as contracts. Specialist guilds advise on Elsewhere negotiation.

**Fate Threading**: Unregulated. Some guilds employ Threaders for specific purposes.

**Colony Summoning**: The other Vent Lands specialty. Colony Engineering advanced here. Hosting common and normalized.

### Fate System Integration

**Expertise Over Pattern**: What you can do matters more than what you're predicted to do. Guild advancement depends on demonstrated capability.

**No Pattern-Crimes**: Deviation isn't criminalized. Pattern fraud addressed through contract law.

### The Warden Order

Guild-negotiated limits. Specific violations only. Guild cooperation required. No independent operations. Minimal presence.

### Law and Order

**Guild Justice**: Members subject to guild discipline. Penalties include fines, status reduction, expulsion.

**Inter-Guild Courts**: Disputes between guilds. Judges from neutral guilds. Precedent-based, expertise-weighted.

**Safety Focus**: Much law concerns safety. Geothermal systems, toxic zones, volcanic hazards require regulation.

## The Far Shelf: Decentralized Resistance

### Political Structure

**No Central Government**: By design. Settled by people who left or fled centralized regions.

**Community Assemblies**: Each settlement governs itself. Decision-making varies—consensus, voting, elder authority, strong chiefs.

**Regional Coordination**: Occasional gatherings for external threats. No standing structure.

### Magic Regulation

Minimal to none. Local customs vary.

**Core Binding**: Generally accepted. Ancestor veneration traditions make binding culturally comfortable.

**Flesh Shaping**: Varies by community.

**Pact Summoning**: Many communities have ongoing Elsewhere relationships predating Orthodox prohibition. Hollow Saints theology originated here.

**Fate Threading**: Sometimes celebrated. Threading represents resistance to fixed fate.

**Colony Summoning**: Accepted, especially in colder areas.

### Fate System Integration

Active resistance.

**No Pattern Certification**: Most communities don't require it. Some have no Loom access.

**Deviation Is Not Crime**: Often virtue. Successful deviants admired.

**Pattern Privacy**: Where Loom exists, pattern is deeply private. Forced reading is assault.

### The Warden Order

No legitimate authority. Operating openly risks arrest or violence. Covert operations only. Some communities offer bounties for captured Wardens.

### Law and Order

**Community Justice**: Each community handles own disputes. No regional courts.

**Restorative Focus**: Repair harm, reintegrate offender, exile as last resort.

**External Threat Focus**: Much "law" concerns how to respond to Heartlands incursion.

## Cross-Regional Dynamics

### Magic Flows

- Flesh Shapers trained in Vent Lands serve clients in Heartlands (discreetly) and Reaches (openly)
- Pact Summoners flee Heartlands for Far Shelf or Reaches
- Fate Threaders survive longest in Far Shelf
- Colony Hosts seek Vent Lands for advanced integration
- Core Binders practice everywhere; sophisticated work in Heartlands and Reaches

### Residue Flows

- Heartlands produces most, exports refined
- Reaches imports raw, exports refined, profits on processing
- Middle Waters imports heavily
- Vent Lands imports minimally
- Far Shelf resists trade

### Jurisdictional Conflicts

**Extradition**: Heartlands demands; others sometimes comply, sometimes refuse.

**Hot Pursuit**: Treaties say no; practice varies.

**Conflicting Judgments**: A practitioner convicted in Heartlands may live legally in Reaches.

### The Uneasy Equilibrium

No region can impose its system on others. Heartlands can't project force effectively. Reaches controls seas but not land. Vent Lands can defend but not attack. Far Shelf can absorb any invasion.

The system persists because everyone fears what would replace it.

*The law is what power says it is. Power varies by where you stand. The only constants are cold, Residue, and the Loom's silent watching.*
