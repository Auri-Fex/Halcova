# Hálcova World Summary

## Overview

**Hálcova** (HAHL-ko-vah) — "The Death-Between" — is a dark fantasy ice world orbiting an orange dwarf star. Every person carries a **Sórscad**, a five-part fate pattern that determines who they are and what they'll become. Something answers when this pattern is read. That something may be divine, may be Elsewhere, may be both. Nobody knows for certain.

The world runs on death. **Pattern Residue** — the energy released when fates dissolve — fuels [Magic Systems](magic_systems.md), industry, and civilization itself. It also absorbs heat, making the world cold. Peace is expensive. War is productive. Some people are worth more dead than alive, and everyone knows the math.

40,000-50,000 years ago, Hálcova was warmer. Something changed it. Ancient structures at both poles hint at deliberate engineering. The five moons orbit in suspiciously perfect resonance. Whoever built the world's systems is gone, but their work persists.

## The Metaphysical Spine

Hálcova isn't a world with an economy—it **is** an economy. Economic and psychological principles are the literal physics of reality here. See more in [Metaphysics](metaphysics.md).

### Economic Principles as Reality

| Principle | Primary Expression | Horror |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Opportunity Cost | [Fate Threading](magic_systems.md) | Spending your own possibilities |
| Sunk Cost Fallacy | [Core Binding](magic_systems.md) | Can't let go of the dead |
| Moral Hazard | [Pact Summoning](magic_systems.md) | Others pay your price |
| Asymmetric Information | [The Loom](fate_system.md) | They know you better than you |
| Principal-Agent Problem | [Warden Order](society.md) | Enforcers serve themselves |
| Externalities | [Residue Economy](magic_systems.md) | Death's costs are socialized |
| Hyperbolic Discounting | [Colony Hosting](magic_systems.md) | The colony waits |
| Prisoner's Dilemma | [Substitution Market](society.md) | Coordination failure as harvest |
| Tragedy of Commons | [Residue Harvesting](magic_systems.md) | Importing death from elsewhere |
| Mechanism Design | [The Loom's Origin](fate_system.md) | Someone built this trap |

### Psychological Principles as Reality

| Principle | Primary Expression | Horror |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Cognitive Dissonance | [Warden Attunement](society.md) | Believing because you sacrificed |
| Attribution Error | [Pattern Essentialism](society.md) | Character vs. circumstance |


- **Determinism vs. Free Will**: The Loom predicts choices. Does prediction remove choice?

## Planetary Parameters

Geography, climate, and moons are covered in [Planetary](planetary.md).

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Star** | Sárgvas (K-type orange dwarf) |
| **Day Length** | 36 hours |
| **Year Length** | 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) |
| **Seasons** | Csend (76d), Olvadás (76d), Láng (77d), Hanyatlás (76d), Köd (45-46d) |
| **Moons** | 5 (Lélek, Hús, Kötel, Vég, Fonál) |
| **Temperature Range** | -70°C (polar) to +20°C (Middle Waters) |
| **Axial Tilt** | ~20° |
| **Orbital Eccentricity** | ~0.15 |

### The Star and Sky

Sárgvas casts amber-gold light. The sky is teal-tinged blue. Sunsets linger in deep amber and blood red. Vegetation evolved dark to absorb available light—black polar, purple-red temperate, red-orange tropical. Auroras are extreme and correlate with Pattern Residue concentration.

### The Five Moons

Each moon corresponds to a Sórscad circle and a magical practice. The orbital resonances are too perfect to be natural—someone arranged them.

| Moon | Association | Character |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Lélek | Soul/Core Binding | Largest, pale gold |
| Hús | Flesh/Flesh Shaping | Medium, reddish |
| Kötel | Binding/Pact Summoning | Medium, dim grey |
| Vég | Death/Colony Summoning | Small, bright white |
| Fonál | Fate/Fate Threading | Smallest, distant |

### The Five Seasons

1. **Csend** (Silence): Deep winter, 76 days. Death, endurance, debt settlement.
2. **Olvadás** (Thaw): Dangerous transition, 76 days. Disease, opportunity.
3. **Láng** (Flame): High summer, 77 days. Conflict, harvest, fate's height.
4. **Hanyatlás** (Decline): Urgent preparation, 76 days. Last chances.
5. **Köd** (Veil): Strange season, 45-46 days. Elsewhere bleed at the poles.

## Geography

### The Five Regions

| Region | Character | Pattern Role | Governance |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Heartlands** | Orthodox center, Great Loom Node | Central (certification required) | Theocratic monarchy |
| **Middle Waters** | Warm archipelago, contested | Varies by controller | Colonial patchwork |
| **Vent Lands** | Volcanic, heat-independent | Secondary to expertise | Guild federation |
| **Far Shelf** | Frontier, heterodox | Rejected | Decentralized autonomy |

### Polar Mysteries

**Northern Cap**: The Wound—where Elsewhere connects to Hálcova. Köd bleed is leakage.

**Southern Cap**: The Prison—something is contained here. Structures designed to hold.

## The Magic System

### The Five Arts

| Art | Cost | Horror |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Core Binding** | Pattern Residue, self-erosion | Echoes don't know they're dead |
| **Pact Summoning** | Your soul (or substitutes) | The entity is honest about eating you |
| **Fate Threading** | Your future possibilities | Eating your own potential |
| **Colony Summoning** | Biomass, identity | Partnership becomes absorption |

### Additional Systems

- **Behavioral Alchemy**: Applied economics as manipulation
- **Residue Engineering**: Processing death-energy into useful forms
- **Pattern Interference**: Manipulating fate directly (possibly mythical)
- **Echo Architecture**: Networks of bound dead
- **Colony Engineering**: Shaping fungi for purpose
- **Prediction Markets**: Trading on future outcomes

---

| Circle | Domain | Associated Moon |
| Léilcrù | Soul/Core | Lélek |
| Húslaimh | Flesh/Body | Hús |
| Cóitcai | Binding/Connection | Kötel |
| Hálmaht | Death/End | Vég |
| Sórscad | Fate/Path | Fonál |

### The Loom

Distributed network that reads, records, and predicts fate. Something called "The Attendance" answers queries. May be divine, may be Elsewhere, may be both. Predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance—the uncertainty is whether it's reading or creating fate.

---

## Governance and Law

Political philosophy and legal frameworks are detailed in [Governance](governance.md).

### Political Philosophy Problems

In a fate-real world:

- What does **justice** mean when actions were predicted?
- What does **consent** mean when choice may be illusory?
- What **legitimizes authority** when the Loom could identify "leadership patterns"?


### Regional Approaches

| Region | Legitimacy Basis | Pattern in Law | Warden Status |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Far Shelf | Community autonomy | Rejected | Illegal |

### Legal Tensions

- **Pattern evidence**: Admissible? Dispositive?
- **Pre-crime intervention**: Can you punish predicted-but-uncommitted crimes?
- **Pattern-weighted sentencing**: Should predicted recidivists serve longer?
- **Residue from executions**: The justice system produces fuel

---

## Society


All traditions accept the Loom's accuracy. They disagree about why it works:

- **Orthodoxy**: The Weaver assigns patterns with divine purpose
- **Threadists**: Fate is still being created; choices participate
- **Hollow Saints**: Fate is a prison; selling your soul is liberation
- **Fleshwrights**: Fate is biology; transcend the meat
- **Colony Cults**: Individual patterns are fragments of an original whole
- **Ancestor Speakers**: The dead advise; binding is dialogue


### Economics

### The Warden Order

Enforcement arm of Loom orthodoxy. Attuned to the Loom through a process that resembles a pact. Hunt deviation, manipulation, evasion. Full authority in Heartlands; contested elsewhere.

- **Flora**: Black (polar) → purple-red (temperate) → red-orange (tropical)
- **Fauna**: Cold-adapted, mostly Residue-avoiding, some specialized feeders
- **Colony organisms**: Unique Residue relationship, basis for hosting magic

---

## Historical Mystery

40,000-50,000 years ago, Hálcova was warmer. Pattern Residue began accumulating. The poles froze. Ancient structures at both poles may have caused or been built to manage the change. The builders disappeared. The moons may have been arranged at this time.
