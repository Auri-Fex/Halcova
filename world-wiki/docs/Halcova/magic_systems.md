## A Comprehensive Guide to the Magic Systems

# Overview

In Hálcova, power is never free. Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects.

The five magical traditions—collectively called the Five Arts—each represent a different answer to the question: *What are you willing to pay?*

| Art | What You Spend | What You Get | What It Costs You |
|-----|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Core Binding** | The dead | Echoes of the deceased | Your sense of self (bleed corruption) |
| **Flesh Shaping** | Blood and meat | Constructed servants | Your body and humanity |
| **Pact Summoning** | Your soul | Elsewhere entities | Your autonomy and existence |
| **Fate Threading** | Your future | Versions of yourself | Your potential and becoming |
| **Colony Summoning** | Corpses and biomass | Fungal constructs | Your identity and bodily sovereignty |

Each Art is a transaction. Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late.

# Category One: Core Binding

## The Art of Holding the Dead

### Fundamental Principle

When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit—something more fundamental. The **core** is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned.

Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as **echoes**—manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life.

The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist.

You know. They don't. That's the relationship.

**What It Is**

The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans—animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo.

**Harvesting**

Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. See [Metaphysics](metaphysics.md).

Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete).

The strongest cores come from:
	- Violent deaths
	- Deaths with unfinished purpose
	- Deaths accompanied by intense emotion
	- Deaths that the dying refused to accept

The weakest cores come from:
	- Peaceful passings
	- Deaths accepted and prepared for
	- Lives that felt complete

## Core Binding (Echo Binding)

Anchors: Physical objects housing bound echoes—figurines, tiles, metal plates, bone carvings, jewelry. The anchor must depict the bound echo, either by natural manifestation or artistic creation. Binders carry as many anchors as they can transport; activation summons echoes, but too many cause resonance interference and physical drain.

Upkeep: Echoes require a consumable resource to remain coherent. Resource economy includes harvesters, refiners, merchants, smugglers, and black markets. See [Society](society.md). Consumption rates vary by echo complexity and awareness. Quality matters—adulterated, counterfeited, aged, or fresh.

Decay: Echo bleed causes phantom sensations, behavioral drift, and memory intrusion. Awareness accelerates decay. Old binders become patchworks of their echoes.

Release: Possible but rare—money, spite, revenge, nostalgia, love, exhaustion. Most binders hold on long past reason.

Opposition: Family, religious/philosophical groups, former binders, governments. The living object; the echoes don't know they're dead.

Economy: Cores are commodities. Poachers, assassins, scavengers, harvesters, brokers, appraisers, storage facilities. Wars produce inventory.

Anomalies: Extracting a core from the living creates disturbing, unstable anomalies.

Terminology: To be developed in conlang—core, binding, echo, anchor, binder, resource, bleed.

# Category Two: Flesh Shaping

## The Art of Constructing Life

### Fundamental Principle

Life is raw potential, waiting for the right conditions to be realized. **Flesh Shaping** is the art of taking this potential and giving it form. By sacrificing your own blood and meat, you can shape and animate matter, creating homunculi—servants that carry out your will.

The horror: each homunculus is a patchwork of materials, held together by your blood and will. They are not alive in the traditional sense; they do not grow, reproduce, or truly think. They are reflections of your own body and mind, distorted and incomplete.

### The Process

**Materials**

Homunculi can be made from any combination of materials: flesh, bone, clay, metal, wax, leather. The more complex the desired homunculus, the more materials and blood are required.

**The Spark**

The spark of life is your own blood, infused with your will and intent. It is what animates the homunculus, giving it the semblance of life. Without this spark, the materials remain inert, mere shapes without purpose or direction.

**Tethering and Conjuring**

Once the homunculus is formed, it must be tethered to you, its creator. This tether is a lifeline, linking the homunculus to your own life force. As long as the tether remains intact, the homunculus will obey your commands and act as your servant.

However, the tether is also a vulnerability. If the homunculus is destroyed, the shock can bleed into you, causing physical and spiritual harm. Moreover, the more homunculi you have active, the weaker each tether becomes, and the greater the strain on your own body and mind.
