**Fate Futures**

Financial instruments that pay out based on whether predictions come true:

- "If subject achieves predicted career trajectory by age 30, contract pays X"
- "If subject dies by predicted cause within predicted window, contract pays Y"
- "If subject deviates significantly from pattern, contract is void"

**Who Trades These**

- Insurance companies (hedging their risk assessments)
- Investment houses (speculating on populations)
- Criminal organizations (betting on specific outcomes they can influence)
- Governments (managing demographic predictions)
# Economics and Class in Hálcova

## Overview

Economics in Hálcova cannot be separated from fate. The [Sórscad pattern](fate_system.md) determines access to credit, employment, insurance, and opportunity. Pattern Residue—the energy of dissolving fates—fuels magic and industry. Death is literally productive.

This creates an economy where some people are worth more dead than alive, where peace is expensive, and where the institutions that predict your future have financial stakes in that prediction coming true.

## The Fate Market

### Pattern as Asset

Your Sórscad is not just identity—it's capital.

**Pattern-Weight**

Some patterns are "heavier" than others:
- More fate-significance
- More likely to impact events
- More valuable as Pattern Residue when released

Heavy patterns belong to:

- Those whose choices ripple outward
- Those predicted for significant outcomes (positive or negative)

Light patterns belong to:
- Those born into marginal circumstances
- Those whose choices affect few others
- Those predicted for unremarkable outcomes

**The Market Implications**

- Heavy patterns command higher prices in substitution deals (Pact Summoning)
- Heavy patterns produce more valuable Residue upon death
- Heavy patterns are worth more to The Loom (more data value)
- Heavy patterns are targets for various exploitation

This creates a hierarchy: some lives have more market value than others, calculated and priced.

# Arbitrage

Patterns are mispriced; arbitrageurs invest in undervalued people and profit when they outperform predictions. Legal but morally ambiguous.

## Credit and Debt

Pattern-based lending: interest rates, collateral, debt spirals. Poor borrowers pledge themselves—residue rights, pact-substitution, echo-indenture. Pact summoning functions like supernatural credit; substitution markets exist for souls.

## Employment and Opportunity

Pattern-gated careers, pattern families and stereotypes, labor markets, wage differentials. Pattern segregation channels people into industries; wage gaps are legal and documented.

## Pattern Residue Economy

Produced at death, concentrated at battlefields, plagues, executions. Demand creates incentives for war, plague, capital punishment. Residue trade: harvesting, refining, distribution, pricing. Magitech sector depends on residue; industries form political blocs.

## Class Structure

Pattern-privileged: favorable patterns, success, low rates, good jobs. Pattern-constrained: unfavorable patterns, struggle, high rates, bad jobs. Pattern-illegible: practitioners, unpredictable, form own communities.

## Industrial Magitech Sector

Residue-powered technology: pattern-engines, communication, transportation, manufacturing, weapons. Labor in magitech: exposure effects, psychological/social impact, pattern-constrained workers.

## Underground Economy

Illegal trade: unregistered cores, substitution services, pattern data, unlicensed binding, black-market homunculi, infection services, fate-fraud, deviation assistance. Criminal organizations structured by pattern-family.

## The Common Person

Daily life: employment, credit, housing, healthcare, family. Coping strategies: acceptance, hustle, escape, resistance.
