<h1 id="halcova-metaphysical-spine">Hálcova: Metaphysical Spine</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Hálcova isn't a world with an economy. Hálcova <strong>is</strong> an economy. The metaphysical substrate of reality operates on the same principles that govern markets, decisions, and resource allocation. This isn't metaphor—it's the literal structure of how existence functions here.</p>
<p>Physics has transaction costs. Identity is a balance sheet. Time is currency with variable exchange rates. Death is a market event. The Elsewhere is a competing market.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="economic-principles-made-literal">Economic Principles Made Literal</h2>
<h3 id="1-opportunity-cost-fate-threading">1. Opportunity Cost (Fate Threading)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: Every choice forecloses alternatives. The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're <strong>harvesting the opportunity cost itself</strong>. The future they didn't choose had value—stored potential—and they're cashing it out.</p>
<p>But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to <em>you</em>. When you harvest one:
- Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path
- Permanently close that path (it's been spent)
- Reduce your total remaining "decision space"</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic—not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic Parallel</strong>: This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. Hálcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-sunk-cost-fallacy-core-binding">2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Core Binding creates echoes—remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding.</p>
<p>The fallacy manifests when:
- The echo becomes corrupted or hostile
- The echo's information becomes outdated
- The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships</p>
<p>Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: "I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment."</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds.</p>
<p><strong>The Structural Element</strong>: The magic system <em>rewards</em> sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful—if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-moral-hazard-pact-summoning">3. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard:
- You get the power
- Someone else pays the price
- Your incentive to be cautious evaporates</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong>:</p>
<p><em>First-level hazard</em>: You make a pact, knowing you can transfer costs to others. You take risks you wouldn't if you had to pay personally.</p>
<p><em>Second-level hazard</em>: Entities <em>know</em> this. They design pacts that encourage substitution because substitution feeds them more souls than cautious single-source extraction would.</p>
<p><em>Third-level hazard</em>: Society knows substitution is possible. This creates:
- A market for "willing" substitutes (debt bondage, religious sacrifice, criminal punishment)
- Insurance-like structures where groups pool substitution risk
- Political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption. Every structural incentive pushes toward finding more people to substitute. The pact-maker who started trying to save their child from illness ends up feeding strangers to the entity because the entity structured the deal to encourage exactly that progression.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: This is how moral hazard works in finance, insurance, environmental policy. Hálcova just makes the externalized cost viscerally visible (your soul being eaten) rather than abstractly distributed (future generations, distant populations, statistical victims).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-asymmetric-information-the-loom">4. Asymmetric Information (The Loom)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: When one party in a transaction knows more than the other, the informed party can exploit the uninformed.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>The Loom knows your pattern. You know only fragments of it. This asymmetry is structural and deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>The Layers</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Layer 1 - Basic Prediction</em>:
- The Loom predicts your behavior better than you can predict yourself
- This information is sold (to employers, lenders, spouses)
- You're priced based on knowledge you don't have access to</p>
<p><em>Layer 2 - Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</em>:
- Predictions affect how people treat you
- Being treated as "likely to fail" makes failure more likely
- The Loom's information advantage compounds over time</p>
<p><em>Layer 3 - The Attendance</em>:
- Whatever answers Loom queries may have its own agenda
- It may provide accurate predictions that serve that agenda
- It may withhold predictions that don't
- Users can't verify which is happening</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: You can never know if your life outcomes are:
- Genuine fate (the pattern is real)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy (the prediction created the outcome)
- Manipulation (the Attendance shaped events to match its predictions)
- Statistical noise (you're the outlier the Loom got wrong, and nobody will believe you)</p>
<p><strong>The Economic Parallel</strong>: This is the information problem in credit scoring, insurance underwriting, hiring algorithms. The scored can't see the model, can't verify its accuracy for their case, and can't escape the consequences of its predictions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-principal-agent-problem-the-warden-order">5. Principal-Agent Problem (The Warden Order)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: When one party (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal), their interests may diverge. The agent may serve their own interests while claiming to serve the principal's.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>The Warden Order ostensibly serves:
- The Weaver (divine principal, if real)
- Society (collective principal)
- The individual's "true pattern" (metaphysical principal)</p>
<p>But Wardens are:
- Humans with personal interests
- Politically embedded in power structures
- Economically dependent on the Residue system
- Psychologically shaped by their Attunement</p>
<p><strong>The Divergences</strong>:</p>
<p>The Order claims to enforce pattern compliance for spiritual/cosmic reasons. But:
- Enforcement generates Residue (executions produce fuel)
- Deviants threaten power structures that benefit the Order
- The Attunement itself may be a form of control (Wardens can't deviate, so they enforce anti-deviation)</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: Wardens genuinely believe they serve higher purposes. The Attunement makes doubt physically painful. But the structure of their situation means their interests align with enforcement regardless of whether enforcement serves the principals they claim.</p>
<p>Is a given Warden:
- Righteous servant of cosmic order?
- Unwitting tool of institutional self-interest?
- Victim of their own Attunement's compulsions?
- All three simultaneously?</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: Every institution with enforcement power faces this. Police, regulators, religious authorities. The agents' interests inevitably diverge from the principals'. Hálcova makes the mechanism explicit and the self-deception visible.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="6-externalities-pattern-residue-economy">6. Externalities (Pattern Residue Economy)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: Externalities are costs or benefits that affect parties not directly involved in a transaction.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Every death releases Pattern Residue that:
- Benefits: Residue harvesters, fuel consumers, magitech users
- Costs: The environment (cooling), the deceased, anyone who valued the deceased</p>
<p>The externalities are massive and structural:
- War benefits Residue producers (positive externality for them)
- War's dead bear the cost (negative externality for them)
- The cooling affects everyone (diffuse negative externality)</p>
<p><strong>The Feedback Loop</strong>:</p>
<p>Because externalities aren't priced into decisions:
- War is underpriced (the benefits are captured; the costs are externalized)
- Peace is overpriced (the costs are borne; the benefits diffuse)
- The system optimizes for death-producing activities</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: This isn't evil people making evil choices. It's rational actors responding to incentive structures. The merchant who profits from Residue trade isn't a monster—they're responding to prices that don't include the full cost of death. The general who extends a war isn't bloodthirsty—they're responding to institutional pressures that reward Residue production.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: Carbon emissions, industrial pollution, financial contagion. The structure is identical: privatized benefits, socialized costs, and rational actors who aren't individually to blame but collectively produce catastrophe.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="7-hyperbolic-discounting-colony-hosting">7. Hyperbolic Discounting (Colony Hosting)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: People systematically overvalue immediate rewards relative to future costs, and this bias is predictable.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Colony hosting offers immediate benefits:
- Warmth (colonies generate heat)
- Strength (biomass integration)
- Connection (to the colony network)
- Belonging (to something larger)</p>
<p>The costs are distant:
- Identity erosion (gradual)
- Autonomy loss (incremental)
- Physical transformation (slow)
- Ultimate absorption (far future)</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong>:</p>
<p>The colony doesn't force anything. It offers:
- Day 1: Warmth when you're freezing
- Day 30: A little more warmth, barely noticeable integration
- Day 365: You can't imagine being cold again; the integration feels natural
- Day 3650: You're not sure where you end and the colony begins; you don't want to know</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: At every decision point, the immediate benefit exceeds the immediate cost. There's no moment where the person makes a clearly bad choice. Each step is marginally rational. The aggregate is catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: Addiction, debt accumulation, relationship deterioration. The mechanism is hyperbolic discounting: we know the future cost but discount it too heavily. The colony just makes the curve visible.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="game-theory-made-literal">Game Theory Made Literal</h2>
<h3 id="8-prisoners-dilemma-the-substitution-market">8. Prisoner's Dilemma (The Substitution Market)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: Individually rational choices can produce collectively irrational outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Consider two potential pact-substitutes who could coordinate:
- If both refuse: The pact-maker can't find substitutes; they bear their own costs; the substitutes live
- If one refuses, one accepts: The acceptor dies; the refuser lives with guilt but lives
- If both accept: Both might die (entity takes both) or might compete for "better" terms</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong>:</p>
<p>Entities deliberately create these dynamics:
- Multiple people offered substitution deals
- Deals structured so accepting is individually rational even though coordinated refusal would be collectively better
- Information asymmetry prevents coordination (you don't know who else was offered)</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The substitute who accepts isn't a victim—they made a choice. The substitute who refuses isn't a hero—they just shifted probability to someone else. Everyone is both perpetrator and victim. The entity harvests not just souls but the coordination failure itself.</p>
<p><strong>The Broader Pattern</strong>: This applies to:
- Workers undercutting each other for Residue-industry jobs
- Nations in security dilemmas over Residue reserves
- Families with members at different pattern-ratings competing for resources</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="9-tragedy-of-the-commons-residue-harvesting">9. Tragedy of the Commons (Residue Harvesting)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: Shared resources are overexploited when individual incentives diverge from collective interest.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Pattern Residue in the environment is a common resource:
- Anyone can harvest ambient Residue
- Harvesting depletes local concentration
- Depletion affects everyone in the area
- But the harvester captures the full value of what they take</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong>:</p>
<p><em>In frontier regions</em>:
- Prospectors race to harvest
- Early harvesters get the richest deposits
- Later arrivals find depleted areas
- The rush depletes faster than sustainable</p>
<p><em>In cities</em>:
- Multiple institutions compete for Residue access
- Each has incentive to harvest more than sustainable
- Collective action to limit harvesting is unstable (defection is rewarded)
- Result: Cities depend on imported Residue (from death elsewhere)</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The death-producing industries exist because cities depleted their local Residue commons. The solution to the tragedy is importing the tragedy—making death happen somewhere else, out of sight, so the commons can stabilize locally.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: Fisheries, groundwater, atmosphere. Hálcova just makes the "somewhere else" visible and the imported cost explicit (it's bodies).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="10-mechanism-design-the-loom-as-engineered-system">10. Mechanism Design (The Loom as Engineered System)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: Institutions can be designed to align individual incentives with desired collective outcomes. But the designer's goals may not be the participants' goals.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Someone designed The Loom. It's a mechanism that:
- Elicits information (pattern readings)
- Provides incentives (prediction access)
- Structures interactions (the Sórscad system)
- Produces outcomes (fate compliance, Residue production, social order)</p>
<p><strong>The Questions</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Who designed it? What were their goals?</em>
- If divine: Goals are unknowable but presumably good
- If ancient civilization: Goals may be irrelevant now (different context)
- If Elsewhere: Goals may be hostile or alien
- If emergent: No designer; outcomes are accidental equilibrium</p>
<p><em>Is the mechanism working as designed?</em>
- Maybe it worked once and broke
- Maybe it's working perfectly (and the horror is intentional)
- Maybe it was hijacked (Elsewhere entities captured the system)
- Maybe it never worked (the designers failed and we're in the failure state)</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: We're inside a designed system. We can't see the design. We can't know the designer's intent. We can't tell if it's functioning or broken. Every interaction with the Loom is participation in someone else's mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Parallel</strong>: Markets, legal systems, platforms. We interact with designed mechanisms daily. We rarely know the designers' full intent. We can't easily tell if outcomes are features or bugs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="psychological-principles-made-literal">Psychological Principles Made Literal</h2>
<h3 id="11-cognitive-dissonance-warden-attunement">11. Cognitive Dissonance (Warden Attunement)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: When actions conflict with beliefs, people adjust beliefs rather than admitting the actions were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>The Attunement process:
- Wardens undergo painful initiation
- They sacrifice personal autonomy (pattern-lock)
- They commit to enforcement (including lethal)
- They gain abilities and status</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance predicts:
- The more sacrifice, the stronger the belief in the cause
- Wardens who execute more will believe more strongly in necessity
- Doubts will be experienced as weakness (not information)</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong>:</p>
<p>The Attunement is designed to maximize dissonance:
- High entry cost → Strong commitment
- Visible sacrifice (lifespan) → Justification pressure
- Enforcement actions → Belief intensification
- Doubt = physical pain → Doubt suppression</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: Wardens aren't brainwashed. They've rationalized themselves into true belief through the normal process of dissonance reduction. The cruelest thing: the mechanism is visible. Wardens can learn about cognitive dissonance. Knowing doesn't help. The Attunement has already shaped their ability to doubt.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="12-prospect-theory-pattern-gambling">12. Prospect Theory (Pattern Gambling)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains, and are risk-seeking when facing losses, risk-averse when facing gains.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Pattern-prediction creates reference points:
- Your predicted trajectory becomes your baseline
- Outcomes better than predicted feel like gains
- Outcomes worse than predicted feel like losses
- The prediction creates the reference, which determines the emotional weight</p>
<p><strong>The Implications</strong>:</p>
<p>Someone with a "bad" pattern who slightly outperforms it feels neutral or mildly positive. Someone with a "good" pattern who slightly underperforms feels devastated.</p>
<p>This drives:
- <em>Pattern-constrained risk-taking</em>: "I'm predicted to fail anyway; might as well gamble"
- <em>Pattern-privileged conservatism</em>: "I have too much to lose; better play safe"
- <em>Pattern fraud</em>: Manipulating predictions to change the reference point
- <em>Köd-timing</em>: Making major decisions during the fifth season when patterns are disrupted</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The Loom doesn't just predict. By predicting, it creates the reference points that shape how people experience outcomes. The prediction changes reality by changing how people feel about reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="13-fundamental-attribution-error-pattern-essentialism">13. Fundamental Attribution Error (Pattern Essentialism)</h3>
<p><strong>The Principle</strong>: People attribute others' behavior to character while attributing their own behavior to circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>The Sórscad system provides:
- Stable, readable "character" attributes
- Official confirmation of what someone "is"
- Prediction-based expectations</p>
<p>This amplifies attribution error:
- Others' failures: "Their pattern predicted this; it's who they are"
- Own failures: "Circumstances; bad luck; the prediction didn't account for context"
- Others' successes: "Their pattern set them up; anyone would succeed with that Sórscad"
- Own successes: "I worked hard; I deserved this regardless of pattern"</p>
<p><strong>The Structural Effect</strong>:</p>
<p>Pattern becomes destiny via attribution:
- Employer sees pattern-constrained worker fail: "Confirmed their pattern"
- Employer sees pattern-privileged worker fail: "Bad luck; give them another chance"
- The attribution difference creates the outcome difference
- Which confirms the pattern
- Which reinforces the attribution</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The pattern is real (it accurately predicts). But it's real because people believe it's real and act accordingly. Unraveling which part is "genuine fate" and which part is "attribution-driven prophecy" is impossible.</p>

<h2 id="philosophical-frameworks-made-literal">Philosophical Frameworks Made Literal</h2>
<h3 id="14-determinism-vs-free-will-the-core-tension">14. Determinism vs. Free Will (The Core Tension)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: If fate is real and readable, is choice meaningful?</p>
<p><strong>Hálcova's Answer</strong>: The question is mal-formed. Here's why:</p>
<p><strong>The Loom predicts choices.</strong> It doesn't make them. Your choice is still yours—you experience deliberation, you feel the decision, you're responsible for outcomes. But the choice was also predicted.</p>
<p><strong>Competing Readings</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Compatibilist</em>: Determinism and free will coexist. Your choices are determined AND free simultaneously. The prediction doesn't remove the choice; it just reveals what you were always going to choose.</p>
<p><em>Hard Determinist</em>: The prediction proves you never had choice. The feeling of choosing is illusion. Agency is story, not reality.</p>
<p><em>Libertarian</em>: The Loom isn't predicting; it's causing. Fate is enforced, not observed. True freedom requires breaking the system.</p>
<p><em>Pragmatist</em>: The question doesn't matter. You have to act as if you have choice because acting otherwise is paralysis. Whether choice is "real" is philosophy; living requires decision.</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: All four readings are defensible. The evidence supports all of them. People choose their metaphysics based on temperament, not proof. Your position on free will becomes part of your pattern.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="15-the-ship-of-theseus-identity-and-binding">15. The Ship of Theseus (Identity and Binding)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: If you replace every component of something, is it still the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>Multiple magic systems transform identity:
- Core Binding: Bleed replaces parts of you with echo-pattern
- Flesh Shaping: Your physical substrate is modified
- Pact Summoning: Your soul is consumed in installments
- Colony Hosting: Your body integrates foreign material
- Fate Threading: You absorb other versions of yourself</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong>: After extensive practice, are you still "you"?</p>
<p><strong>Competing Answers</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Orthodox</em>: Your Sórscad defines you. Pattern changes are legible. You're "you" until your pattern is too corrupted to read—then you're something else.</p>
<p><em>Fleshwright</em>: The ship metaphor assumes stable identity. Identity is process, not substance. "You" are whatever the current configuration is doing.</p>
<p><em>Elsewhere Faction (Mirrors)</em>: Identity is observer-dependent. You're "you" to those who remember the old configuration. You're someone else to those who only know the new.</p>
<p><em>Ancestor Speaker</em>: Identity is relational. You're "you" as long as your echo would recognize you. The dead are the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: There's no fact of the matter. Different frameworks give different answers. Your sense of continuity may be accurate or may be false memory constructed by your current configuration. You can't check.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="16-the-experience-machine-elsewhere-entities">16. The Experience Machine (Elsewhere Entities)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: If you could enter a machine that gives you any experience you want, should you? What makes "real" experiences valuable?</p>
<p><strong>How It Manifests</strong>:</p>
<p>The Hungry faction of Elsewhere entities wants sensation. They offer:
- Any experience you can imagine
- No physical consequences in your world
- Pure sensation, unlimited</p>
<p><strong>The Implicit Bargain</strong>:</p>
<p>What you lose:
- Authenticity (experiences are generated, not earned)
- Connection (others can't share the experience)
- Growth (you're not learning from resistance)
- Reality (you're in something else's domain)</p>
<p>What you gain:
- Everything else</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: The Hungry don't force anyone. They offer. People accept. The experience machine is real and available. The philosophical question has a practical answer: yes, many people choose simulation over reality.</p>
<p>And it's not clear they're wrong.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-elsewhere-as-competing-economic-system">The Elsewhere as Competing Economic System</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-idea">The Core Idea</h3>
<p>The Elsewhere isn't a place. It's an alternative transaction framework.</p>
<p><strong>In Hálcova</strong>:
- Scarcity is fundamental
- Exchange requires equivalent value
- Ledgers must balance
- Debt creates obligation</p>
<p><strong>In the Elsewhere</strong>:
- Scarcity may not apply (or applies differently)
- Exchange follows different rules
- "Balance" has different meaning
- Debt and obligation are the only reality</p>
<h3 id="the-factions-as-economic-philosophies">The Factions as Economic Philosophies</h3>
<p><strong>The Accountants</strong>: Debt as fundamental reality. Everything is owed. The universe is a ledger. They don't want your soul to destroy it—they want your soul because you owe it. The debt always existed; paying is just acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>The Hungry</strong>: Consumption as fundamental value. Experience is the only good. Scarcity is the only evil. They offer abundance because abundance is right. The cost is dependency, but dependency on abundance beats independence in scarcity.</p>
<p><strong>The Architects</strong>: Order as fundamental value. Arrangement matters. Position determines function. They don't want destruction—they want reconfiguration. You in the right place, doing the right function, forever.</p>
<p><strong>The Mirrors</strong>: Observation as fundamental reality. To be seen is to exist. They don't consume—they witness. Your value is as object of attention. They offer significance (being watched) in exchange for access (being seen).</p>
<p><strong>The Absent</strong>: Negation as fundamental value. The absence of desire, the absence of transaction, the absence of existence. They want nothing because wanting is the problem. What do they offer? Release. From the ledger. From the pattern. From existence.</p>
<h3 id="the-metaphysical-competition">The Metaphysical Competition</h3>
<p>Hálcova's reality and Elsewhere compete for... something. Souls? Pattern-mass? Existential territory?</p>
<p>The Köd bleed is border conflict. The polar structures are fortifications. The Loom may be weapon, defense system, or neutral infrastructure captured by one side.</p>
<p>The war—if it is a war—has no front, no treaties, no clear stakes. Just pressure at the boundaries and casualties on both sides (though "casualty" means different things to each).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-loom-as-attention-economy">The Loom as Attention Economy</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-idea_1">The Core Idea</h3>
<p>What if the Loom doesn't predict fate—it allocates attention?</p>
<p><strong>The Mechanism</strong>:</p>
<p>Reality in Hálcova may require observation to stabilize. Unobserved events remain probabilistic. The Loom directs attention—deciding which possibilities collapse into actuality.</p>
<p><strong>The Implications</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Prediction is Selection</em>: The Loom doesn't see what will happen; it decides what will happen by choosing what to observe. Prediction and causation are the same act.</p>
<p><em>The Attendance is Observer</em>: Whatever answers queries is the observing entity. Its attention creates reality. Its attention is finite (or it would observe everything). Querying the Loom directs its attention.</p>
<p><em>The Competition for Observation</em>: There's not enough attention for everyone. Some people/events get observed (their fates crystallize). Others remain fuzzy (deviation is possible). The allocation of attention is the allocation of fate.</p>
<p><strong>The Horror</strong>: Getting the Loom's attention isn't protection—it's determination. The pattern-illegible aren't cursed; they're free. Deviation isn't defiance; it's slipping through the cracks where attention doesn't reach.</p>
