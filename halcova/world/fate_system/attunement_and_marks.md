## Attunement

Attunement is the process by which certain individuals, such as Wardens and Loom operators, gain the ability to perceive patterns, violations, and metaphysical currents. This comes at a cost: Attunement marks appear around the eyes, and prolonged exposure can lead to bleed, memory loss, or psychological strain.

## Marks

Attunement marks are visible signs of metaphysical sensitivity. They are both a badge of office and a warning, marking the bearer as someone who has seen too much.

## Effects

- Enhanced perception of patterns and violations
- Susceptibility to bleed and pattern contamination
- Social stigma or reverence, depending on context
