### The Loom Calendar (Szövőnaptár)

The standard calendar counts years from the **Integration Century**—the period when the current political and religious order was established.

- **Before Integration (BI)**: Years counted backward from Integration (e.g., 500 BI = 500 years before Integration began)
- **After Integration (AI)**: Years counted forward (e.g., 347 AI = 347 years after Integration began)

**Current Year**: 347 AI

### Era Divisions

| Era | Duration | Calendar Dates |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| Ancient Era | ~50,000-3,000 BI | Poorly documented |
| Dark Millennia | ~3,000-500 BI | Fragmentary records |
| Rising Era | ~500 BI-0 | Recorded history begins |
| Integration Century | 0-100 AI | Formative period |
| Orthodox Era | 100-347 AI (present) | Current order |

## The Ancient Era (~50,000-3,000 BI)

### What Is Known

This era is understood primarily through:
- Archaeological evidence
- Loom-queries (fragmentary, possibly biased)
- Ancient structures (polar facilities, moon arrangement)
- Inherited knowledge from Elsewhere entities

### Major Events

**~50,000 BI: The Cooling Event**

The Ancient Builders complete their fate-reading project. Consequences:
- Global temperature begins dropping
- Pattern Residue economy begins
- The northern wound opens or worsens
- Elsewhere entities notice Hálcova

**~50,000 BI: The Transformation**

The Builders transform themselves into the Attendance. Events:
- Mass upload into the proto-Loom
- The Dissenter faction imprisoned
- The Builder civilization ends
- Their descendants begin the long adaptation

**~50,000-10,000 BI: The Ice Age**

Hálcova settles into its current cold state. Humanity survives in:
- The Middle Waters (geothermal and volcanic heat)
- The Vent Lands (geothermal zones)
- Scattered temperate pockets elsewhere

Population likely dropped to hundreds of thousands globally.

**~10,000-3,000 BI: The Recolonization**

As humanity adapts to the Residue economy, populations begin expanding:
- Settlement of the Heartlands river valleys
- Maritime development in the Shattered Reaches
- First permanent settlements outside geothermal zones
- Development of Residue-burning technology

### What Remains Unclear

- How much Builder knowledge survived the transformation
- Whether the Five Arts existed before or developed after
- The exact relationship between early humans and the Attendance
- Why the Attendance chose to establish the Loom for humans (rather than simply abandoning them)

---

## The Dark Millennia (~3,000-500 BI)

### Character of the Era

Written records are fragmentary. Multiple civilizations rose and fell. The period is characterized by:
- Repeated contact-and-collapse cycles with the Attendance
- Development of competing magical traditions
- Early pattern-reading without systematic implementation
- Frequent Elsewhere incursions (Köd effects less controlled)

### Major Events

**~3,000 BI: The First Loom-Keepers**

Organized religious traditions begin forming around Loom-nodes:
- Recognition that something answers queries
- Development of ritual practices for pattern-reading
- First systematic Sórscad interpretations
- Competing schools claiming different truths about fate

**~2,500 BI: The Flesh Shaper Wars**

A series of conflicts in what is now the Vent Lands:
- Flesh Shaper guilds compete for dominance
- First documented use of homunculus armies
- Civilian populations caught between construct forces
- Eventual guild compromise establishes territorial boundaries

**~2,000 BI: The First Colony Plague**

An uncontrolled colony spreads across the Middle Waters:
- Thousands infected
- First understanding of colony ecology
- Development of containment protocols
- Origins of what become the Colony Cults

**~1,500 BI: The Pact Flowering**

A period of intensive Elsewhere contact:
- Multiple factions establish communication
- Pact Summoning becomes widespread
- The Accountants emerge as the dominant contact faction
- First substitution markets develop

**~1,200 BI: The Shattered Heartlands Conflict**

The final separation of Heartlands and Reaches cultures:
- Political split following religious schism
- Maritime development accelerates in the Reaches
- The Narrow Sea becomes a contested border
- Seeds of later rivalry planted

**~800 BI: The Far Shelf Discovery**

Reaches explorers make sustained contact with the Far Shelf:
- Discovery of existing indigenous populations
- First extraction of Far Shelf resources
- Initial trading posts established
- Beginning of colonial tensions

**~600 BI: The Great Köd**

An unusually intense Köd season:
- Elsewhere bleed extends beyond normal polar zones
- Multiple entity incursions across all regions
- Estimated population loss: 30-40%
- Surviving civilizations reorganize

This event creates the conditions for the Rising Era—old powers broken, new ones emerging.

## The Rising Era (~500 BI-0)

### Character of the Era

Written records become reliable. The period is characterized by:

- Beginning of the "neutral ground" tradition

**~300 BI: The Reaches Merchant League**

The Shattered Reaches develop their characteristic political structure:
- City-state confederation with rotating leadership
- Maritime law codified
- Pattern-enforcement looser than Heartlands
- Formal recognition of practitioner communities

**~250 BI: The Middle Waters Crisis**

Colonial competition escalates into open conflict:
- Heartlands, Reaches, and Vent Lands all claim territory

- First Pattern-Severance executions

**~150 BI: The Far Shelf Resistance**

Indigenous Far Shelf populations push back against extraction:
- Coordinated attacks on trading posts
- First emergence of Hollow Saint doctrine

- Far Shelf independence effectively established

**~100 BI: The Pre-Integration Synthesis**

Multiple crises force cooperation:
- Köd season of 112 BI particularly severe

- Elsewhere activity increases (Architect faction makes moves)
- Leaders from major powers begin discussing systematic reform

**~50 BI: The Integration Councils**

Negotiations begin for a new order:

## Historical Mysteries

### Unresolved Questions

**The Great Köd (600 BI)**: What caused the unusual intensity? Was it natural fluctuation or deliberate action?

**The Pattern Collapse of Vaskapu (278 AI)**: Accident, attack, or system failure? No official explanation exists.

**The Entity Embassy (305 AI)**: What did the Attendance negotiate with the Accountants? What was exchanged?

**The Marker Stone Destruction Pattern**: Sixteen stones destroyed over recorded history. Random vandalism or coordinated campaign?

**The Builder Ruins**: Why do some show signs of violence? What happened in the final days of their civilization?
