# The Five Arts: Mechanical Interactions

## Overview

The Five Arts don't exist in isolation. When practitioners of different Arts encounter each other—or when a single practitioner attempts multiple Arts—complex interactions occur. This document establishes the rules for how the Arts combine, conflict, and create emergent effects.

## Detailed Interactions

### Core Binding + Flesh Shaping: SYNERGY

**How They Combine:**

A Flesh Shaper can create a body. A Core Binder can anchor an echo to it.

**Possible Results:**
- **Constructed Servants**: Homunculi with bound echoes become true constructs—bodies without living occupants, animated by dead patterns
- **Preserved Minds**: A dying person's echo can be bound to a shaped replacement body (imperfect; the echo degrades faster than in an anchor-object)
- **Enhanced Anchors**: Flesh-shaped organic material makes superior anchors for echoes (living tissue holds patterns better than dead matter)

**The Costs Stack:**
- The Flesh Shaper pays their cost (bleed, feeding)
- The Core Binder pays their cost (echo-weight, degradation)
- Combined work requires combined maintenance

**Strategic Implications:**
- Wealthy patrons commission "living portraits"—flesh constructs housing ancestral echoes
- Military applications: soldiers whose echoes persist in backup bodies
- The practice is extremely expensive (requires two rare practitioners)

**Limits:**
- Echoes in flesh-constructs degrade faster (~50% normal anchor lifespan)
- The construct needs feeding even if it has no living occupant
- Multiple echoes in one construct cause rapid breakdown

---

### Core Binding + Pact Summoning: CONFLICT

**The Problem:**

Echoes and entities compete for the same resource: pattern-space within a person or object.

**What Happens:**
- Attempting to bind an echo into a pact-holder causes the echo to be *consumed* by the entity's claim
- Attempting to summon an entity into an echo-bound anchor causes the anchor to shatter
- The two Arts actively interfere with each other

**Specific Effects:**
- **Entity Consumption**: If a Pact Summoner tries to host an echo, their bound entity *eats* it—gaining strength, becoming more present
- **Echo Rejection**: Echoes instinctively avoid Pact Summoners; binding becomes much harder
- **Anchor Destruction**: Elsewhere entities can target echo-anchors specifically, destroying them to feed

**Strategic Implications:**
- Pact Summoners are natural predators of Core Binders
- Core Binders avoid Pact Summoners and their bound entities
- Some entities specifically hunt echoes; summoners who bind them become "echo-hunters"

**Limits:**
- The conflict is automatic; it can't be controlled
- A person cannot meaningfully practice both Arts (the entity would consume any echo they tried to bind)

---

### Core Binding + Fate Threading: COMPLEMENTARY

**How They Work Together:**

Echoes are frozen moments of pattern. Fate Threading pulls alternate pattern-states. Together, they can access versions of the dead.

**Possible Results:**
- **Echo Interrogation**: A Fate Threader can pull alternate-timeline versions of an echo's source, extracting information the echo doesn't contain
- **Pattern Reconstruction**: Combining echo-fragments with threaded alternates can reconstruct more complete patterns
- **Death-Avoidance Viewing**: Threading can show what the deceased *would have* done, while the echo shows what they *did*

**The Costs Remain Separate:**
- No direct cost amplification
- Both practitioners pay their normal costs
- But the *information* gained may have value worth the combined price

**Strategic Implications:**
- Investigation teams pairing the two Arts
- Historical reconstruction projects
- Intelligence operations (interrogating the dead's potential futures)

**Limits:**
- Threading a dead person's alternates is *very* difficult (most alternates are also dead)
- The combination doesn't extend life or restore the dead
- Information-only benefit

### Core Binding + Colony Hosting: PARASITIC

**The Problem:**

Colonies perceive echoes as *food*. Not metaphorically—they will attempt to consume bound echoes.

**What Happens:**
- **Colony Predation**: A Colony Host's passengers will attack nearby echoes, trying to break their anchors and consume the pattern-energy
- **Anchor Corruption**: Colonies can *infest* echo-anchors, slowly consuming the echo from within
- **Host Immunity**: Colony Hosts cannot successfully bind echoes (their passengers eat any attempt immediately)

**Specific Effects:**
- **The Hunt**: Colonies within 10-20 meters of an echo-anchor become agitated, seeking the echo
- **Anchor Infestation**: Colonies can enter anchor-objects, consuming the echo over days to weeks
- **Echo Extinction Events**: A heavily-infested area can become completely echo-free as colonies consume all bound patterns

**Strategic Implications:**
- Colony Hosts are used to "clear" areas of lingering echoes
- Core Binders must protect their anchors from Colony Hosts
- Some use colonies as weapons against echo-based defenses

**Limits:**
- Colonies can be directed but not perfectly controlled
- They may attack echoes the Host wanted preserved
- Strong echoes can damage or destroy attacking colony fragments

### Flesh Shaping + Pact Summoning: NEUTRAL

**The Interaction:**

Surprisingly little direct interaction. Entities and shaped flesh exist in different categories.

**What Happens:**
- Flesh Shaping works normally on Pact Summoners
- Pact-granted abilities work normally on Flesh Shapers
- No special synergy or conflict

**However:**
- **Entity Modifications**: Some entities request specific body modifications as part of pacts (the summoner must find a Flesh Shaper or become one)
- **Shaped Vessels**: Flesh Shapers can create bodies that make better entity-vessels (dangerous; attracts entity attention)
- **Mutual Vulnerability**: Both Arts corrupt the pattern; a practitioner of both degrades faster

**Strategic Implications:**
- No particular reason to seek or avoid the combination
- Some Summoners learn basic Flesh Shaping to maintain their modified forms
- Some Flesh Shapers make pacts to enhance their capabilities

**Limits:**
- Practicing both Arts is possible but accelerates pattern-corruption
- No unique capabilities emerge from combination

---

### Flesh Shaping + Fate Threading: INTERFERENCE

**The Problem:**

Flesh Shaping alters the current body. Fate Threading pulls from alternate selves. The two processes interfere.

**What Happens:**
- **Threading Difficulty**: Heavily modified bodies have fewer viable alternates (most alternates weren't modified identically)
- **Shaping Instability**: Pulled alternate-fragments may have different modifications, causing rejection
- **Pattern Confusion**: The body's pattern becomes "blurred" when both Arts are active

**Specific Effects:**
- **Reduced Threading Options**: Each modification reduces viable alternate pool by ~20-30%
- **Rejection Risk**: Pulled alternates may have incompatible biology, causing graft-rejection-like effects
- **Temporary Reversion**: Heavy threading can temporarily revert recent modifications

**Strategic Implications:**
- Flesh Shapers who want threading access limit their modifications
- Fate Threaders avoid significant body modification
- Some use the reversion effect deliberately (threading away unwanted modifications)

**Limits:**
- The interference is percentage-based, not absolute
- Minor modifications have minor effects
- Major modifications make threading nearly impossible

---

### Flesh Shaping + Colony Hosting: COMPETITION

**The Problem:**

Both Arts modify the body. They compete for the same biological resources.

**What Happens:**
- **Resource Competition**: Colonies and shaped modifications both require the body's resources
- **Mutual Interference**: Colonies may consume shaped tissue; shaped changes may isolate/kill colony fragments
- **Accelerated Deterioration**: The body breaks down faster under both pressures

**Specific Effects:**
- **Tissue Priority**: Body prioritizes one or the other; the less-prioritized degrades
- **Colony Adaptation**: Over time, colonies may incorporate shaped tissue—unpredictably
- **Hybrid Effects**: Sometimes the combination produces novel tissue types (usually harmful)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Practitioners generally choose one or the other
- Some deliberately combine for unique (risky) effects
- The combination is particularly taxing on the body

**Limits:**
- Lifespan reduction of ~30-50% when practicing both
- Unpredictable interactions make planning difficult
- Maintenance costs compound

### Pact Summoning + Fate Threading: AMPLIFICATION

**The Synergy:**

Entities exist partially outside normal time. Fate Threading accesses alternate timelines. Together, they can access things neither could alone.

**What Happens:**
- **Entity-Guided Threading**: Entities can help navigate alternate timelines, reducing cost and increasing accuracy
- **Cross-Timeline Pacts**: Pacts can theoretically be made with versions of entities from alternate timelines (extremely dangerous)
- **Amplified Vision**: Entity senses combined with threading provide unprecedented foresight

**Specific Effects:**
- **Reduced Threading Cost**: Entity guidance reduces threading cost by ~30-50%
- **Extended Range**: Can access more distant/unlikely alternates
- **Entity Interest**: Entities *want* this combination; they offer better terms to threaders

**Strategic Implications:**
- This combination is particularly powerful for intelligence/foresight
- Entities actively recruit Fate Threaders
- The Warden Order watches this combination closely

**Limits:**
- Entity "guidance" comes with entity agenda
- Cross-timeline pacts are almost always disasters
- The power attracts dangerous attention

**Warning:**
Entities that help with threading always have ulterior motives. They're using the threader to access things they couldn't reach alone.

---

### Pact Summoning + Colony Hosting: CORRUPTION

**The Interaction:**

Entities and colonies are both "other." They recognize each other. They do not get along.

**What Happens:**
- **Mutual Recognition**: Entities perceive colonies as competitors; colonies perceive entities as threats
- **Internal Conflict**: A body hosting both becomes a battleground
- **Corruption Cascade**: The conflict accelerates pattern-corruption for both

**Specific Effects:**
- **Colony Rebellion**: Colonies in a Pact Summoner may attack the entity's influence, causing internal damage
- **Entity Predation**: Entities may consume colony fragments, incorporating them unpredictably
- **Host Deterioration**: The conflict damages the host regardless of winner
- **Hybrid Entities**: Rarely, entity and colony merge into something new and terrible

**Strategic Implications:**
- The combination is almost never intentional
- Accidentally acquiring one when you have the other is a crisis
- Some use the conflict deliberately (setting entities against colonies)

**Limits:**
- Survival rate for dual practitioners is very low (<20% five-year survival)
- The combination is considered suicide by most practitioners
- Hybrid entities are universally dangerous

---

### Fate Threading + Colony Hosting: DISRUPTION

**The Problem:**

Colonies have no pattern in the normal sense. Threading requires pattern-resonance. The two don't mix.

**What Happens:**
- **Threading Blindness**: Colonies create "blind spots" in threading—areas where alternates can't be accessed
- **Colony Isolation**: Threading temporarily severs connection to colony passengers
- **Pattern Noise**: Heavy colony presence makes threading inaccurate

**Specific Effects:**
- **Reduced Accuracy**: Threading accuracy decreases ~5-10% per colony maturity level
- **Temporary Disconnection**: During threading, colonies "sleep" or become inactive
- **Reading Interference**: Trying to thread someone with colonies produces static

**Strategic Implications:**
- Colony Hosts make poor Fate Threaders (and vice versa)
- Colonies provide some protection against hostile threading
- Investigators can detect colony presence via threading interference

**Limits:**
- The effect is interference, not total blocking
- Light colony presence has minimal effect
- The disruption goes both ways (threading disrupts colonies too)

## Multi-Art Practitioners

### General Principles

**Most People Practice One Art:**
- Each Art is demanding enough alone
- Costs compound when practicing multiple Arts
- Specialization is more efficient

**Dual Practitioners Exist:**
- Rare but not unheard of
- Usually one primary Art, one secondary
- Lifespan significantly reduced

**Triple+ Practitioners:**
- Extremely rare
- Usually die young
- Often powerful but unstable

### Survival Rates

| Arts Practiced | Average Lifespan (from start of practice) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| One | 20-40 years | Varies by Art |
| Two | 10-20 years | Depends on combination |
| Three | 5-10 years | Very rare |
| Four | 2-5 years | Almost unheard of |
| Five | <1 year | Theoretical only |

### The Forbidden Combinations

**Core Binding + Pact Summoning**: Functionally impossible due to conflict

**All Five**: No one has survived attempting all five. The costs compound catastrophically.

---

## Practitioner Cooperation

### Team Dynamics

When practitioners of different Arts work together without sharing Arts:

**Core Binder + Flesh Shaper Teams:**
- Most common cooperation
- Binder provides echo-resources; Shaper provides bodies
- Stable, productive partnership

**Fate Threader + Pact Summoner Teams:**
- Powerful but dangerous
- The entity always has agenda
- Requires careful management

**Colony Host + Any Other:**
- Colony Hosts often work alone
- Colonies may threaten partners
- Requires spatial separation during sensitive work

### Institutional Cooperation

**The Warden Order:**
- Maintains practitioners of multiple Arts
- Uses team structures for complex operations
- Carefully manages interaction risks

**Criminal Organizations:**
- Less careful about interaction risks
- Higher practitioner mortality
- Sometimes achieves things institutions won't attempt

---

## Emergent Phenomena

### When Arts Combine in the World

**Pattern Storms:**
When multiple high-level practitioners conflict, the pattern-substrate itself can become unstable:
- Reality becomes temporarily fluid
- Predictions fail
- Unexpected effects manifest

**Residue Cascades:**
Certain Art combinations produce unusual Residue types:
- Core + Flesh = "Living Residue" (extremely valuable)
- Pact + Threading = "Paradox Ash" (dangerous, sought by entities)
- Colony + Any = "Infected Residue" (spreads colonies)

**The Unraveling:**
When all five Arts are used in proximity:
- Local pattern begins to break down
- Elsewhere bleeds through
- Reality may not recover

---

## Summary

The Five Arts interact in complex ways:

- **Synergies** (Core+Flesh, Pact+Threading): Greater than sum of parts
- **Conflicts** (Core+Pact, Colony+Pact): Mutual interference or destruction
- **Neutral** (Flesh+Pact): Minimal interaction
- **Interference** (Flesh+Threading, Threading+Colony): Reduced effectiveness
- **Parasitic** (Core+Colony): One feeds on the other
- **Competition** (Flesh+Colony): Resource conflict

Understanding these interactions is crucial for:
- Practitioners planning their development
- Institutions managing practitioner teams
- Anyone encountering multiple-Art situations

The costs always compound. The benefits sometimes do.
