# Currency and Monetary Systems of Hálcova

## Overview

Hálcova's economy operates on a multi-tiered monetary system with the **mark** as the standard unit of account. Regional variations exist, but the Heartlands standard has achieved near-universal acceptance for inter-regional trade.

## The Heartlands Standard

### Base Currency: The Mark (Márka)

The **mark** (márka, MAHR-kah) is the fundamental unit of currency, originally representing a specific weight of refined silver.

**Physical Form**: A silver coin approximately 25mm in diameter, bearing:
- Obverse: Crown seal and year of minting
- Reverse: Regional mint mark and denomination

### Denominations

| Denomination | Name | Value | Physical Form | Common Uses |
|--------------|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1/12 mark | Penny (Fillér) | 0.083 marks | Small copper coin | Daily purchases, bread, simple meals |
| 1/4 mark | Quarter (Negyed) | 0.25 marks | Large copper coin | Modest purchases, ale, basic services |
| 1/2 mark | Half (Fél) | 0.5 marks | Bronze coin | Day's food, cheap lodging |
| 1 mark | Mark (Márka) | 1 mark | Silver coin | Standard trade unit |
| 5 marks | Crown (Korona) | 5 marks | Large silver coin | Significant purchases |
| 20 marks | Shield (Pajzs) | 20 marks | Gold coin | Major transactions |
| 100 marks | Seal (Pecsét) | 100 marks | Heavy gold coin | Institutional/wholesale trade |

### Slang Terms

- **Coppers**: Fillér and negyed collectively
- **Silver**: Marks
- **Yellow**: Gold coins (shields and seals)
- **A crown's worth**: Five marks, common price reference
- **Dead man's wage**: What pattern-constrained laborers earn (often 1-2 marks/day)

## The Residue Standard

### Residue as Currency

In many contexts, **Pattern Residue** functions as an alternative currency, particularly for:
- Magic-related transactions
- Cross-regional trade (Residue is universally valuable)
- Black market operations
- Substituting for hard currency in remote areas

### Residue Denominations

| Grade | Description | Approximate Value |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Raw (unrefined) | Fresh harvest, unstable | 1-5 marks per unit |
| Refined (standard) | Processed, stable | 10-25 marks per unit |
| Concentrated | High-potency | 50-100 marks per unit |
| Pattern-Specific | Matched to particular uses | 100-500 marks per unit |
| Pact-Grade | Suitable for Elsewhere transactions | 500+ marks per unit |
| Ancient | Pre-Transformation deposits | 2-5× standard prices |

**A "unit"** is approximately what one human death produces in raw form, refined down to a small vial of stable Residue.

### Residue Exchange

Residue can be exchanged for currency at:
- **Licensed refineries**: Official rates, taxed
- **Merchant houses**: Market rates, slight markup
- **Black market**: Variable rates, untaxed, risky

**Exchange volatility**: Residue prices fluctuate based on:
- War/peace conditions (war = abundant supply = lower prices)
- Seasonal demand (Köd = higher demand)
- Regional supply disruptions
- Speculation

## Regional Currencies

### Shattered Reaches

The Reaches use Heartlands currency but maintain their own supplementary system:

**Island Tokens**: Local currencies backed by specific islands' trade goods
- Not accepted everywhere
- Discounted when exchanged for marks
- Useful for internal island commerce

**Trade Shells** (Kagylópénz): Traditional currency for inter-island trade
- Still used in some communities
- Roughly 1 shell = 1-2 marks depending on size/quality
- Decorative value beyond monetary worth

### Vent Lands

Guilds issue their own **guild scrip**:
- Valid within guild operations
- Exchangeable for marks at guild banks
- Sometimes trades at premium (strong guilds) or discount (weak guilds)

**Forge Marks**: A parallel system based on metal weight
- More trusted than Crown marks by some
- Backed by actual refined metal held in guild vaults
- Exchange rate typically 1.05-1.1 standard marks

### Middle Waters

Highly diverse, no single standard:
- Heartlands marks accepted
- Reaches tokens circulate
- Vent Lands scrip present
- Local currencies from various colonial periods
- **Money changers** are essential and take 5-15% commission

### Far Shelf

**Barter dominant**: Currency is secondary to direct exchange

When currency is used:
- Heartlands marks (for dealing with southerners)
- **Pelts and preserved goods** function as currency
- Ancient Residue sometimes used as exchange medium

**Trade Company Scrip**: The extraction companies issue their own currency
- Workers paid in scrip
- Redeemable at company stores (at unfavorable rates)
- Exchangeable for marks at company offices (at worse rates)
- Major grievance in colonial relationship

## Banking and Credit

### Banking Institutions

**The Concordat Treasury**: Religious institution managing Crown finances
- Issues official currency
- Maintains monetary standards
- Provides banking services to nobility and institutions

**Merchant Banks**: Private institutions
- Accept deposits
- Issue credit
- Finance trade ventures
- Concentrated in Heartlands and Reaches

**Guild Banks** (Vent Lands): 
- Guild-specific financial services
- Often more trusted than merchant banks
- Inter-guild credit arrangements

### Credit Instruments

**Letters of Credit**: Documents guaranteeing payment
- Issued by banks against deposited funds
- Accepted by known correspondents
- Essential for long-distance trade

**Bills of Exchange**: Promises to pay
- Can be traded/sold before maturity
- Discount reflects risk and time value

**Pattern-Backed Notes**: Credit secured by Sórscad assessment
- Interest rate varies with pattern
- Pattern-privileged: 5-10% annual
- Pattern-constrained: 20-40% annual or higher
- Collateral requirements scale inversely with pattern quality

### Interest Rates

**Standard rates** (Year 476, Heartlands):
| Borrower Type | Annual Interest |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Crown/nobility | 4-8% |
| Merchant houses | 8-15% |
| Pattern-privileged individuals | 10-20% |
| Pattern-constrained individuals | 25-50% |
| Unsecured/high-risk | 50-100%+ |

**Usury concerns**: Orthodox doctrine technically limits interest, but:
- "Service fees" circumvent restrictions
- Pattern-risk premiums considered legitimate
- Enforcement inconsistent

---

## Taxation

### Heartlands Taxes

**Crown Taxes**:
- **Hearth tax**: Per-household, varies by district (2-10 marks annually)
- **Trade tax**: On commercial transactions (typically 5-10%)
- **Pattern tax**: Based on Sórscad reading (pattern-privileged pay more, theoretically)
- **Residue tax**: On Residue sales and transfers (15-25%)

**Church Tithes**:
- Orthodox faithful expected to tithe 10%
- Often negotiated or evaded
- Collected separately from Crown taxes

**Guild Dues** (where applicable):
- Membership fees
- Transaction percentages
- Apprentice/journeyman/master fees

### Regional Variations

**Reaches**: Lower Crown taxes, higher island/captain levies
**Vent Lands**: Guild dues replace some Crown taxes
**Middle Waters**: Complex colonial extraction system
**Far Shelf**: Minimal taxation, company extraction instead

---

## Counterfeiting and Fraud

### Currency Crimes

**Coin clipping**: Shaving metal from coins
- Detectable by weight
- Severe penalties (loss of hands)

**Debasing**: Mixing base metals
- Requires sophisticated equipment
- Institutional crime (corrupt mints)

**Forgery**: Fake coins or notes
- Pattern-readers can sometimes detect
- Major crime (death penalty possible)

### Pattern Fraud

**More serious than currency fraud**:
- Falsifying Sórscad records
- Presenting false pattern readings
- Using altered pattern documents

**Penalties**: Warden Order jurisdiction, severe punishment

---

## Economic Idioms

**Money-related expressions**:
- "Worth a seal" = very valuable
- "Not worth a fillér" = worthless
- "Counting coppers" = being cheap/poor
- "Yellow problems" = rich person's concerns
- "Shield-heavy" = wealthy
- "Residue-rich" = wealthy through death trade (slightly pejorative)
- "Pattern-priced" = overcharged due to constrained status
- "Marked down" = discriminated against economically

**Negotiation phrases**:
- "Crown price" = fair market value
- "Constrained rate" = inflated price for disadvantaged buyers
- "Clean marks" = legitimate currency (not stolen/counterfeit)
- "Warm coin" = recently acquired, possibly suspicious

---

## Summary

Hálcova's monetary system is:
- **Mark-based**: Silver standard, decimal subdivisions
- **Residue-supplemented**: Death-energy as parallel currency
- **Regionally varied**: Different systems coexist
- **Pattern-stratified**: Economic access tied to fate reading
- **Credit-enabled**: Sophisticated financial instruments exist
- **Taxed**: Multiple overlapping extraction systems

The currency reflects the world's central tensions: death as economic engine, pattern as social destiny, and the tension between standardization and regional autonomy.
