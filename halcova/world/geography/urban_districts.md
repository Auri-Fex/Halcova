# Urban Districts of Fonváros

## Temple Hill

The spiritual and bureaucratic heart of the city, home to the Great Temple, Pattern House, and the Loom Nexus. Site of Binding ceremonies and the seat of Szòvòtarar authority.

## Merchant City

The domain of the pattern-privileged: wealthy families, trading houses, and the social elite. Merchant City is defined by its opulence and its proximity to power.

## Hand Quarter

The district of the pattern-constrained. Marked by poverty, labor, and a sense of resignation, the Hand Quarter is both a place of suffering and quiet resistance.

## Shadow City

A liminal space of markets, informants, and the city’s underbelly. Shadow City is where secrets are traded and the law is flexible.

## Threshold Market

A borderland of commerce and negotiation, where the city’s castes and interests collide.
