## Heterodox Religious Practices

### Threadist Observances

**Different Emphasis**:
- Same calendar structure
- Different interpretation of meaning
- Pattern Day = "Choice Day" (celebrating agency)
- Weaver's Days = "Weaving Days" (participating in design)

**Distinctive Practices**:
- Meditation on unmade choices
- Fate Threading demonstrations (where legal)
- Discussion circles on fate and freedom
- Less emphasis on acceptance, more on engagement

### Hollow Saint Practices

**Rejected Calendar**:
- Don't observe Orthodox holy days
- Own commemorations (martyrdom dates, etc.)
- Köd is "Liberation Season" (Elsewhere = escape)

**Distinctive Practices**:
- Pact encouragement ceremonies
- Honoring the "empty" (fully consumed)
- Secret gatherings
- Theological education

### Colony Cult Practices

**Network Communion**:
- Regular group rituals connecting hosts
- Shared consciousness experiences
- Feeding the colony as sacred act
- Ancestor incorporation ceremonies

**Seasonal Observances**:
- Tied to colony life cycles
- Fruiting seasons have special significance
- Warm seasons more active than cold

### Ancestor Speaker Practices

**Echo Maintenance**:
- Regular "conversations" with bound ancestors
- Family shrine maintenance
- Offerings to anchors
- Consultation before major decisions

**Calendar Integration**:
- Participate in Orthodox calendar
- Add ancestor-focused elements
- Csend especially important (the dead are closer)
- Köd avoided (echoes become unstable)

## Pilgrimage Traditions

### Orthodox Pilgrimages

**The Great Node**:
- Most important pilgrimage destination
- Where the Loom is strongest
- Special readings available
- Journey itself considered spiritually valuable

**Regional Nodes**:
- Closer destinations for those who can't reach Great Node
- Each has associated miracles/stories
- Seasonal pilgrimages organized

**Holy Sites**:
- Places where significant pattern-events occurred
- Historical figures' birthplaces/death sites
- Alleged miracle locations

### The Polar Pilgrimages

**Northern Approach**:
- Pilgrimage toward the Wound
- Seeking visions, revelations
- Extremely dangerous
- Few complete it; fewer return unchanged

**Southern Approach**:
- Pilgrimage toward the Prison
- Hollow Saints especially
- Believed to weaken fate's chains
- Also dangerous

## Prayer and Meditation

### Orthodox Prayer Forms

**Pattern-Acknowledgment**:
> "My pattern is my path. The Weaver's thread guides my steps. I accept what was drawn and walk where I am led."

**Morning Invocation**:
> "The Weaver wakes in me. Another day within the design. May my thread strengthen the cloth."

**Evening Reflection**:
> "The day's weaving is done. Where I strayed, forgive. Where I held true, remember. The pattern continues in sleep."

**Deviation Confession**:
> "I have pulled against my thread. I have questioned what was drawn. I have wished for patterns not my own. Weaver, restore my place in the design."

### Meditation Practices

**Pattern Contemplation**:
- Visualizing one's own Sórscad
- Understanding each circle's meaning
- Accepting the whole configuration
- 30-60 minutes daily (devout practitioners)

**Loom Awareness**:
- Sensing one's place in larger pattern
- Connection to others' threads
- The web of fate
- More advanced practice

## Sacred Objects and Spaces

### In the Temple

**The Loom Representation**:
- Symbolic loom (not actual pattern-engine)
- Central altar position
- Five-colored threads representing circles
- Woven cloth as sacred symbol

**The Registry Copy**:
- Temple keeps local pattern records
- Sacred duty to maintain
- Accessible for verification

**Residue Vessels**:
- Consecrated containers for offerings
- Burning Residue during services
- The smoke represents pattern-return

### Personal Sacred Objects

**Pattern-Plaques**:
- Personal Sórscad inscribed on metal/wood
- Worn or displayed
- Touched for reassurance
- Given at Binding Draw

**Thread-Bundles**:
- Five colored threads representing circles
- Used in prayer
- Tied to significant objects

**Anchor Shrines** (Ancestor Speakers):
- Maintained in homes

## Clergy and Religious Roles

### Orthodox Priesthood

**Hierarchy**:
- Acolyte → Priest → Senior Priest → Bishop → Archbishop → High Weaver
- Training: 5-7 years
- Pattern-reading: Basic ability required
- Celibacy: Not required (regional variation)

**Duties**:
- Conduct services and rituals
- Perform Natal and Binding draws
- Maintain temple and records
- Counsel the faithful
- Report deviation to Wardens

**Numbers**:
- ~50,000 priests across Hálcova
- Concentrated in Heartlands
- Thinner in peripheral regions

### The Inquisition

**Role**:
- Investigate heresy
- Church court prosecution
- Distinct from Warden Order (religious vs. pattern crimes)
- Sometimes overlap/conflict

**Methods**:
- Investigation and interrogation
- Confession encouraged (torture if necessary)
- Trial before Church court
- Penalties: Penance to execution

### Loom-Keepers (Religious Aspect)

**Dual Role**:
- Technical operators (Concordat function)
- Religious figures (interpreting the Weaver's will)
- Some are also ordained priests
- The overlap creates ambiguity

## Death and Afterlife Beliefs

### Orthodox Doctrine

**What Happens at Death**:
1. Pattern releases from body
2. Residue forms (physical remainder of pattern)
3. Pattern-essence returns to the Weaver
4. Incorporated into the Great Design
5. May influence future patterns (not reincarnation, but resonance)

**The Good Death**:
- Accepting one's pattern to the end
- Residue properly harvested and offered
- Pattern returns cleanly to the Weaver
- Remembered by the living

**The Bad Death**:
- Resisting pattern at the end
- Deviation-death (killed for pattern-crimes)
- Residue corrupted or lost
- Pattern returns damaged, may cause harm

### Echo Theology

**Orthodox Position**:
- Echoes are not the person (just pattern-trace)
- Binding is permitted but spiritually neutral
- The true pattern has returned to Weaver
- Extended binding may be spiritually harmful

**Ancestor Speaker Position**:
- Echoes retain something of the person
- Binding is reunion, not imprisonment
- The dead advise the living
- Eventually release to complete the journey

### Elsewhere and the Afterlife

**Orthodox Position**:
- Elsewhere entities are not related to the dead
- Consumption by entity = destruction, not afterlife
- The Absent's nihilism is anti-existence
- Proper death returns pattern to Weaver

**Hollow Saint Position**:
- Consumption is liberation from the pattern-prison
- No afterlife is better than trapped afterlife
- The empty have escaped fate entirely
- This is the true good death

---

## Summary

Religious practice in Hálcova encompasses:

- **Liturgical calendar**: Tied to seasons and life-cycles
- **Multiple traditions**: Orthodox dominant, heterodox persistent
- **Prayer and meditation**: Focused on pattern-acceptance
- **Sacred objects**: Pattern-plaques, thread-bundles, shrines
- **Clergy**: Priests, Loom-Keepers, Inquisitors
- **Afterlife beliefs**: Pattern-return vs. liberation vs. destruction

The religious calendar structures social life, and religious interpretation of pattern gives meaning to fate.
