# Flora and Fauna of Hálcova

## Overview

Life on Hálcova has adapted to a cold world with amber light, five seasons, and the presence of Pattern Residue. The K-type star produces less ultraviolet and more infrared, resulting in dark-colored vegetation and cold-adapted fauna.

## Creatures of Note

### Fate Hounds

**Origin**: Pattern-attuned wolves, bred and modified by the Warden Order

**Capabilities**:
- Track patterns across any distance
- Sense deviation before it manifests
- Disrupt enemy pattern-abilities
- Communicate with Attuned handlers

**Appearance**:
- Larger than normal wolves
- Eyes show faint luminescence
- Move with unnatural precision
- Unsettling to observe

**Numbers**: ~200 exist across all regions

**Breeding**: Limited success; most pups don't survive attunement

### Residue-Touched Creatures

**What They Are**:
- Animals exposed to high Residue concentrations
- Mutations and changes result
- Found near death sites, battlefields, polar regions
- Unpredictable behavior

**Examples**:
- Residue-bears (larger, more aggressive, pattern-sensitive)
- Ghost-fish (translucent, found near underwater death sites)
- Plague-rats (carriers of disease, drawn to death)

**Danger**: Variable; some merely strange, others actively dangerous

### Elsewhere-Adjacent Creatures

**Köd Manifestations**:
- During the strange season, creatures appear
- May be Elsewhere entities or something between
- Generally dangerous
- Disappear when Köd ends (usually)

**Permanent Elsewhere-Touched**:
- Rare creatures that persist year-round
- Usually in polar or isolated regions
- Often subjects of legend
- Warden Order interest

## Ecological Patterns

### Seasonal Cycles

**Csend (Winter)**:
- Most animals dormant or migrated
- Predators scarce (prey hibernating)
- Ice hunting possible (seals, etc.)
- Minimal plant activity

**Olvadás (Thaw)**:
- Animals emerging/returning
- Breeding season begins
- Disease spreads (pathogens thaw)
- Plants beginning growth

**Láng (Summer)**:
- Maximum activity
- Breeding, feeding, growing
- Best hunting
- Harvest of plants

**Hanyatlás (Autumn)**:
- Preparation for winter
- Migration begins
- Final harvest
- Animals fattening

**Köd (Veil)**:
- Strange animal behavior
- Some species hide
- Elsewhere creatures appear
- Hunting avoided

### Residue Ecology

**Death Concentrations**:
- Battlefields, plague sites have altered ecology
- Plants may grow differently (stunted or overgrown)
- Animals avoid or are drawn
- Residue-touched creatures more common

**The Cold Connection**:
- Residue absorbs heat
- High-Residue areas are colder
- Creates ecological niches
- Pattern for ancient death sites

## Uses and Resources

### Hunting

**Game Animals**:
- Elk, hare, goat primary targets
- Seasonal restrictions (practical and legal)
- Pattern-constrained often restricted
- Residue from kills belongs to hunter (usually)

**Dangerous Game**:
- Bears, wolves hunted for bounty
- Fur trade significant
- Status hunting for wealthy
- Residue premium for dangerous kills

### Animal Products

| Product | Source | Use | Value |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Wool | Woolbacks | Textiles | Moderate |
| Leather | Various | Clothing, equipment | Moderate |
| Fur | Wild animals | Cold-weather clothing | High |
| Meat | Various | Food | Variable |
| Bone/Antler | Various | Tools, decoration | Low-moderate |
| Residue | All pattern-bearers | Fuel, magic | Variable |

### Animal Residue

**The Economic Calculation**:
- Animal Residue is weaker than human
- But animals are more numerous and expendable
- Bulk heating from animal Residue
- Human Residue for magic and premium uses

**Production**:
- Slaughterhouses are Residue facilities
- ~20 million livestock slaughtered annually
- Produces ~45% of total Residue
- Essential to the economy

## Summary

Hálcova's ecosystem is characterized by:

- **Dark vegetation**: Adapted to K-type star light
- **Cold-adapted fauna**: Thick-furred, hardy species
- **Residue interaction**: Animals and plants respond to pattern-energy
- **Seasonal extremes**: Life cycles tied to five-season calendar
- **Economic integration**: Animals as Residue source as much as food

The biosphere supports civilization while also being shaped by Hálcova's unique metaphysical conditions.
