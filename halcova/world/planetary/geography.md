# Hálcova: Geography and Continental Structure

## Overview

Hálcova's landmasses are arranged around the habitable equatorial band, with two major continents and three significant landmasses forming five distinct regions. The geography tells a story—the Heartlands and Shattered Reaches were once a single continent, torn apart by some ancient catastrophe. The rift that separated them became the Narrow Sea.

---

## The Shattered Heartlands Theory

### The Evidence

Looking at the coastlines, the relationship is obvious:
- The ragged eastern coast of the Greater Continent matches the western edge of the Shattered Reaches
- Rock formations, mineral deposits, and fossil-equivalents continue across the gap
- The Narrow Sea is a flooded rift valley, not a true ocean basin
- Ancient ruins exist on both sides with matching architectural styles

### What Happened

Unknown. Theories include:
- Geological catastrophe (natural rift)
- The same event that caused the cooling
- Deliberate separation (by whom? why?)
- Elsewhere incursion that physically tore reality
- The creation of the Loom requiring tremendous energy release

The shattering is ancient—tens of thousands of years at minimum. But the mystery feeds religious interpretation, political claims, and treasure-hunting expeditions.

## The Greater Continent (The Heartlands)

### Shape and Structure

A crescent-shaped landmass curving from northwest to southeast, with the concave side facing the Middle Waters. The curve creates a natural harbor effect for the entire southern coast.

**Dimensions**: Roughly 4,000 km along the outer curve, 800-1,200 km wide at various points.

### Major Geographic Features

**The Spine Mountains** (*Gerincláncz*)

A mountain range running along the curve of the continent, roughly following the crescent's arc. This range:
- Blocks polar winds from the interior
- Creates a rain shadow effect (northern interior is dry and cold; southern coast receives moisture)
- Contains the highest peaks on Hálcova
- Rich in mineral deposits, including concentrated Pattern Residue veins

*Notable Peaks*:
- **The Watcher** (*Az Őrszem*): Highest peak, visible from the sea on clear days. Site of an ancient observatory, now a Loom relay station.
- **The Broken Tooth** (*Törött Fog*): A collapsed peak, evidence of ancient volcanic activity or something else. Hollow Saints claim it marks where "fate cracked."
- **The Twins** (*Az Ikrek*): Two peaks of nearly identical height, separated by a pass. The main land route between northern and southern Heartlands.

**The Interior Plateau** (*Fennsík*)

Behind the Spine, a vast elevated plateau stretches toward the northern ice.

Characteristics:
- Elevation: 1,500-2,000m above sea level
- Climate: Cold, dry, windy
- Vegetation: Hardy tundra grasses, black lichen, scattered dwarf trees
- Population: Sparse—nomadic herders, mining settlements, Warden outposts
- Pattern Residue: High concentration (ancient battlefield sites, unexcavated)

**The River Valleys**

Major rivers cut through the Spine from the interior, creating the primary population centers.

*The Five Rivers*:
1. **The Gold** (*Aranyi*): Largest river, drains to the southeast coast. The capital region.
2. **The Iron** (*Vasalj*): Northern river, flows to the Narrow Sea. Industrial heartland.
3. **The Silent** (*Csendi*): Flows north, disappears under the ice cap. Sacred to Ancestor Speakers.
4. **The Broken** (*Törötti*): Western river, fragmented into multiple channels. Difficult to navigate.
5. **The Vein** (*Véna*): Southern river, reddish sediment. Flesh Shaper territory—the sediment is mineral, not blood, but the association stuck.

**The Southern Coast**

The concave inner coast facing the Middle Waters.

Characteristics:
- Climate: Mildest on the continent (warm current arrival)
- Terrain: Rolling hills, river deltas, natural harbors
- Population: Dense—major cities, agricultural land, trade ports
- Loom Coverage: Maximum—the Great Node is here

**The Northern Edge**

Where the continent meets the ice cap.

Characteristics:
- Climate: Extreme—permanent ice within 100km
- Terrain: Glacial, unstable, constantly shifting
- Population: Minimal—extraction outposts, Warden stations, exiles
- Köd Effects: Partial bleed zone during the fifth season

### Political Geography

The Heartlands contain multiple political entities, but shared characteristics:
- Orthodox faith dominant
- Loom integration in governance
- Recognition of the Great Node's authority (in religious matters at minimum)
- Interconnected through the river valley trade networks

Specific nations/kingdoms to be developed separately.

## The Shattered Reaches

### Shape and Structure

The "missing piece" of the original continent, now fragmented into one large island-continent and hundreds of smaller islands. The western coast clearly shows where it once connected to the Heartlands.

**Main Island**: Roughly 1,500 km north-south, 600 km east-west
**Island Chains**: Extending another 1,000 km eastward in clusters

### Major Geographic Features

**The Matching Coast**

The western edge of the main island—steep cliffs, deep fjords, a mirror of the Heartlands' eastern ragged coast. Sailors navigating the Narrow Sea see both coasts and understand they're traveling through a wound.

**The Interior Highlands**

The main island's interior is mountainous—a continuation of the Spine, now separated.

Characteristics:
- Peaks lower than the Spine (erosion, or the separation lowered them)
- Heavy precipitation (maritime climate)
- Dense, dark forests in the valleys (black-barked conifers)
- Fast rivers with short courses to the sea

**The Fracture Zone**

The eastern portion of the main island and the inner island chains show evidence of additional breaking—smaller rifts, sea-filled valleys, unstable geology.

Theories:
- Secondary breaks after the main separation
- Ongoing geological instability
- The pattern continues to crack
- Elsewhere influence weakening material reality

**The Island Chains**

Hundreds of islands extending eastward:

*The Near Chains*: Close to the main island, connected by sea ice during Csend. Large islands with permanent populations, small islands used seasonally.

*The Middle Chains*: Further out, less connected. Independent communities, sometimes isolated for entire winters. Strong Ancestor Speaker traditions.

*The Far Chains*: Scattered islands approaching the Far Water. Sparse population, expedition staging points, pirate havens.

### Maritime Character

The Shattered Reaches are defined by the sea:
- Every settlement is coastal or river-accessible
- Naval power determines political influence
- Fishing and sea-hunting are primary food sources
- Shipbuilding is the prestige industry
- Sea ice creates seasonal connectivity (Csend connects islands; Olvadás isolates them)

### Political Geography

Fragmented by design:
- No continental-scale political unity
- City-states control mainland harbors
- Island kingdoms vary in size from single-island to chain-spanning
- Merchant leagues provide economic coherence across political divisions
- The Orthodox church is present but not dominant

## The Middle Waters

### Shape and Structure

An archipelago of volcanic islands straddling the equatorial band. The warmest region on Hálcova—the only place that never freezes.

**The Great Island**: Central caldera island, roughly 200 km diameter
**Major Islands**: 20-30 islands of significant size (50+ km)
**Minor Islands**: Hundreds of smaller islands, atolls, and reef formations

### Major Geographic Features

**The Caldera** (*The Eye*)

The Great Island is the rim and interior of a dormant supervolcano. The caldera itself is partially flooded, creating a protected inner harbor of extraordinary value.

Characteristics:
- Caldera diameter: ~50 km
- Rim elevation: 500-1,500m above sea level
- Inner harbor: Deep, protected, warm
- Geothermal activity: Hot springs, steam vents, warm ground
- Köd protection: The caldera experiences almost no Elsewhere effects

*The Protection Mystery*:
Why is the caldera protected during Köd? Theories:
- Geothermal energy disrupts the bleed
- Ancient warding built into the volcanic structure
- High life density anchors reality
- Something in the caldera that Elsewhere avoids
- Combination of factors

The truth may involve ancient engineering—the caldera shows signs of modification that don't match natural formation.

**The Reef Systems**

Cold-adapted reef analogues (not coral—something else) surround many islands.

Characteristics:
- Built by colonial organisms adapted to cold water
- Create protected lagoons and channels
- Rich fishing grounds
- Navigation hazards for unfamiliar sailors
- Possible Pattern Residue interaction (the organisms may process it somehow)

**The Thermal Vents**

Underwater volcanic vents heat surrounding waters. Where these occur:
- Water temperature is significantly higher
- Unique ecosystems develop
- Fog banks form (warm water meeting cold air)
- Strategic value for winter fishing grounds

### Climate Advantage

Why the Middle Waters stay warm:

1. **Latitude**: Equatorial position receives maximum Sárgvas energy
2. **Volcanic heat**: Geothermal contribution to ground and water temperature
3. **Ocean currents**: Warm water pools here rather than flowing away quickly
4. **Köd protection**: Less Pattern Residue precipitation during the strange season
5. **Unknown factor**: The caldera's protection extends partially to surrounding islands

### Political Geography

The most contested territory on Hálcova:
- Every major power wants presence here
- Colonial holdings, trading posts, military bases from multiple regions
- Native island cultures caught between imperial interests
- Colony Cults have significant influence (warm, wet conditions favor fungi)
- Religious diversity—Orthodoxy present but not dominant

---

## The Vent Lands

### Shape and Structure

A continental fragment in the southern hemisphere, defined by extreme volcanic activity. Smaller than the Heartlands but geologically intense.

**Dimensions**: Roughly 1,200 km north-south, 800 km east-west
**Coastline**: Irregular, with many peninsulas and deep bays

### Major Geographic Features

**The Fire Range** (*Tűzlánc*)

An active volcanic mountain chain running the length of the landmass.

Characteristics:
- 20+ active volcanoes
- Continuous geothermal activity (hot springs, geysers, fumaroles)
- Lava flows reshape geography on human timescales
- Ash falls fertilize surrounding valleys
- Toxic gas zones in low-lying areas

**The Thermal Valleys**

Protected valleys between volcanic ridges where geothermal heat creates habitable conditions.

Characteristics:
- Warm year-round (geothermal, not solar)
- Lush vegetation (by Hálcova standards)
- Dense population concentration
- Natural hot water for bathing, cleaning, industrial processes
- Some valleys toxic or unstable (constant monitoring required)

**The Steam Fields**

Where glaciers meet geothermal zones.

Characteristics:
- Constant steam and fog
- Unstable footing (ice over warm ground)
- Flash floods when ice dams break
- Bizarre ice formations (frozen steam, thermal-sculpted glaciers)
- Disorienting travel conditions

**The Sulfur Flats**

Lowland areas where volcanic gases concentrate.

Characteristics:
- Yellow-crusted ground (sulfur deposits)
- Toxic air at ground level
- Uninhabitable without protection
- Valuable mineral extraction (sulfur, other volcanic minerals)
- Worked by protected crews or homunculi

### Economic Advantage

The Vent Lands don't need Pattern Residue for heat:
- Geothermal energy provides heating, cooking, industrial power
- Independence from the Residue trade network
- Wealth from unique resources (volcanic minerals, geothermal-forged metals)
- Political independence from Orthodox/Loom institutional pressure
- Fleshwright traditions developed here (blood doesn't freeze; more experimentation possible)

### Political Geography

Unified by geography rather than conquest:
- Thermal valleys function as semi-independent city-states
- Volcanic activity forces cooperation (warning systems, refugee support)
- Trade federation rather than empire
- Orthodoxy present but weaker (they need the Vent Lands more than reverse)
- Fleshwright guilds have unusual legal status and power

## The Far Shelf

### Shape and Structure

The most distant inhabited continent, in the southern hemisphere. Large, relatively flat, and cold.

**Dimensions**: Roughly 2,000 km east-west, 1,500 km north-south
**Coastline**: Long and exposed, few natural harbors

### Major Geographic Features

**The Shelf Proper**

The continent is a vast, low-elevation landmass—a continental shelf that barely rises above sea level in many areas.

Characteristics:
- Elevation: 0-500m over most of the landmass
- Terrain: Flat to gently rolling
- Drainage: Poor—marshes, bogs, seasonal lakes
- Permafrost: Underlies most of the interior

**The Southern Ice Edge**

The continent's southern coast merges into the southern ice cap.

Characteristics:
- No clear boundary between land and ice
- Glaciers extend from the cap across coastal regions
- Ice cliffs along some stretches
- Full Köd bleed zone

**The Mineral Ranges**

Low mountain ranges in the continental interior.

Characteristics:
- Rich ore deposits (iron, copper, rare metals)
- Difficult extraction (permafrost, short work season)
- Mining settlements operate seasonally or with heavy Residue-burning for heat
- Tensions between extraction interests and indigenous populations

**The Tundra**

Most of the continental interior.

Characteristics:
- Black and purple vegetation mat (tundra grasses, lichens)
- Migrating herd animals
- Nomadic populations following herds
- Long winters, brief intense summers
- Less Loom coverage than any other inhabited region

### Frontier Character

The Far Shelf is the edge of the known world:
- Last region to be contacted/colonized
- Still incompletely mapped in the interior
- Indigenous populations with pre-Loom traditions
- Threadist movements began here (distance from Orthodox center)
- Hollow Saints operate more openly
- Warden Order presence thin and stretched

### The Survival Paradox

The Far Shelf is the poorest, coldest inhabited region—yet it maintains independence from Heartlands integration. How?

**Resource Leverage**

Beneath the permafrost lie significant deposits:
- Iron and copper in the Mineral Ranges
- Rare metals essential for pattern-engine construction
- Concentrated Pattern Residue from ancient death sites (frozen, preserved, unharvested for millennia)
- The largest untapped Residue reserves on Hálcova

The Far Shelf can't efficiently extract these resources, but neither can anyone else—without local cooperation. This creates bargaining power: "You want our minerals? Accept our terms."

**Decentralization as Defense**

There's nothing to conquer:
- No capital city to capture
- No central government to overthrow
- No concentrated population to subjugate
- Thousands of scattered settlements across hostile terrain

Military conquest would require permanent occupation of territory larger than the Heartlands, in worse conditions, against populations that can simply withdraw into the interior. The logistics are impossible.

**Population Hardiness**

Generations of survival have created people genuinely harder to control:
- Cold tolerance that outlasts occupying forces
- Subsistence skills that don't depend on trade
- Social structures that function without centralized hierarchy
- Willingness to accept suffering that breaks invaders

**Cost-Benefit Calculation**

The Heartlands have done the math:
- Conquest cost: Astronomical (logistics, casualties, ongoing occupation)
- Conquest benefit: Marginal (resources still hard to extract, resistance ongoing)
- Trade cost: Accepting Far Shelf independence and heterodoxy
- Trade benefit: Access to resources without occupation costs

Trade wins. The Far Shelf remains independent not through military strength but through being more trouble than it's worth.

**Hollow Saint Theology**

The region's dominant religious framework reframes poverty as virtue:
- Suffering proves you're escaping fate's prison
- Material deprivation is spiritual liberation
- The cold that kills is also the cold that frees
- Independence from the Loom is worth any physical cost

This ideology makes the population resistant to the carrots that work elsewhere. They don't *want* integration. They want to be left alone to suffer freely.

### Political Geography

Fragmented and contested:
- Coastal trading posts controlled by distant powers
- Interior effectively independent (hard to project power into tundra)
- Indigenous confederacies resist external control
- Colonial tensions with Heartlands interests
- Religious heterodoxy tolerated by necessity

## The Seas

### The Narrow Sea

**Location**: Between the Heartlands (east coast) and Shattered Reaches (west coast)
**Character**: A flooded rift valley—the wound where the continents separated

**Characteristics**:
- Width: 200-400 km at various points
- Depth: Deep central channel (the original rift), shallow coastal shelves
- Currents: Complex—warm water entering from south, cold from north
- Ice: Partially freezes during Csend (creates ice roads between landfalls)
- Traffic: The busiest sea route on Hálcova

**Navigation Hazards**:
- Ice floes during Csend/Olvadás
- Fog banks where water temperatures differ
- Tidal races in narrow passages
- Submerged rocks (the rift left debris)

**Strategic Value**:
- Controls trade between two major regions
- Historical site of naval conflicts
- Chokepoints fortified on both sides
- Whoever controls the Narrow Sea influences continental politics

### The Central Ocean

**Location**: Between the northern landmasses and the southern (the gap in the middle of the ring)
**Character**: The largest open ocean, surrounding the Middle Waters

**Characteristics**:
- Width: Variable—2,000+ km in places
- Depth: Deep ocean basins
- Currents: The Great Thermal Loop circulates here (warm from Middle Waters, cold returns from poles)
- Ice: Center stays liquid even in Csend (thermal upwelling)
- Traffic: Moderate—dangerous crossing but necessary for inter-regional trade

**Navigation Hazards**:
- Distance (no landfalls for long stretches)
- Storms (thermal gradient creates weather)
- Cold (outside the Middle Waters warmth)
- The Central Deep (a region where depth makes vessels feel uneasy—possible Elsewhere bleed)

### The Vent Strait

**Location**: Between the Middle Waters and the Vent Lands
**Character**: A warm-water channel kept ice-free by geothermal activity

**Characteristics**:
- Width: 300-500 km
- Depth: Moderate (volcanic seafloor)
- Currents: Warm outflow from Vent Lands geothermal sources
- Ice: Never freezes
- Traffic: Heavy year-round

**Navigation Hazards**:
- Underwater volcanic activity (occasionally)
- Dense fog (warm water, cold air)
- Crowded shipping lanes
- Piracy (year-round accessibility means year-round predation)

### The Far Water

**Location**: Between the Shattered Reaches and the Far Shelf
**Character**: The widest, coldest, most dangerous crossing

**Characteristics**:
- Width: 3,000+ km at minimum
- Depth: Variable—some shallow banks, some deep trenches
- Currents: Cold, flowing from the southern ice
- Ice: Ice-free in central regions, but icebergs drift through
- Traffic: Light—only when necessary

**Navigation Hazards**:
- Distance (the longest unsupported crossing)
- Cold (requires heavy Residue-burning for heat)
- Storms (nothing breaks them across this distance)
- Icebergs (unpredictable, ship-killing)
- Isolation (rescue is unlikely)

### The Bitter Crossing

**Location**: Connecting the Heartlands and Far Shelf via polar route
**Character**: Impassable except when frozen

**Characteristics**:
- Route: Curves north through near-polar waters
- Summer: Impossible—ice pack, bergs, no continuous route
- Csend: Freezes solid—becomes an ice road
- Duration: 60+ days to cross on foot/sled

**The Ice Road**:
- Historical primary connection before long-distance sailing
- Still used for heavy cargo that can't risk sea voyage
- Operates only during Csend (narrow window)
- Crosses partial Köd bleed zone—travelers must finish before the fifth season
- Warden outposts along the route (for safety and monitoring)

---

## The Polar Regions

### The Northern Cap

**Extent**: Everything north of approximately 70° latitude equivalent

**Characteristics**:
- Permanent ice sheet (3-4 km thick in center)
- No permanent human habitation in deep polar zone
- Transition zone (ice edge to permanent ice) is seasonally accessible
- Full Köd bleed during the fifth season

**What's There**:
- Ice
- Concentrated Pattern Residue (ancient, unharvested)
- Ruins under the ice (confirmed by expeditions)
- Creatures adapted to extreme cold (rare, dangerous)
- Something else (see: Polar Mystery)

### The Southern Cap

**Extent**: Everything south of approximately 65° latitude equivalent (extends further north due to continental anchoring by the Far Shelf)

**Characteristics**:
- Permanent ice sheet (thinner than northern, 1-2 km)
- Merges with the Far Shelf's southern coast
- Slightly more accessible (land connection)
- Full Köd bleed during the fifth season
- **Different character from the northern cap** (see: Polar Mystery)

**What's There**:
- Ice
- The Shelf's southern glaciers
- Mineral deposits (inaccessible)
- Something different from the north (see: Polar Mystery)

### The Polar Mystery

**The Core Truth**: The two poles are not the same.

**The Northern Cap: The Wound**
- This is where the Elsewhere connects to Hálcova
- The Köd bleed isn't entities "breaking through"—it's leakage from a permanent connection
- The ice and cold may be natural, or may be attempting to seal/slow the leakage
- Ancient ruins here may be from a civilization that understood the connection (and failed to close it)

**The Southern Cap: The Prison**
- Something is contained here
- The Pattern Residue concentration is higher than it should be (deliberate accumulation)
- The cold is more engineered than natural
- Ancient structures here appear designed to hold, not to live
- Whatever is contained was put there by someone who understood both the Elsewhere and the Loom

**The Implications**:
- Expeditions to the north find evidence of contact with the Elsewhere
- Expeditions to the south find evidence of imprisonment
- Very few people know both truths
- The relationship between the wound and the prisoner is unclear (did one cause the other? are they related entities? is the prisoner there to guard the wound?)

---

## Ocean Currents: The Great Thermal Loop

### The System

Water circulation in Hálcova's oceans follows a pattern shaped by temperature gradients, weak Coriolis effect, and geothermal sources.

### Surface Currents (Warm)

**The Middle Flow**:
- Warm water pools in the Middle Waters (equatorial heating + volcanic)
- Surface flow moves north and south toward poles
- Carries heat, moderating coastal temperatures
- Provides moisture for precipitation
- Supports marine life migration patterns

**Regional Branches**:

*Southern Heartlands Current*: Warm water reaches the Heartlands' concave coast, making it the mildest continental region. This is why civilization centered here first.

*Vent Lands Branch*: Warm current meets geothermal outflow, creating exceptionally warm waters in the Vent Strait. Year-round ice-free, rich fishing.

*Shattered Reaches Split*: Current divides around the main island. Western branch keeps inner channels warmer. Eastern branch cools quickly, making far islands colder.

*Far Shelf Failure*: Current disperses before reaching the Far Shelf. No warm water arrives. Coldest coasts.

### Deep Currents (Cold)

**The Return Flow**:
- Surface water cools as it moves poleward
- Cold water sinks at high latitudes
- Deep current returns toward equator
- Upwells in certain zones, bringing nutrients

**Regional Effects**:

*The Northern Heartlands Coast*: Cold return current makes these waters harsh. Fishing is dangerous but productive (nutrient-rich upwelling).

*The Central Deep Upwelling*: Where cold water rises in the Central Ocean. Rich fishing, but far from land. Creates the "uneasy" zone where vessels feel observed.

*The Vent Upwelling*: Where geothermal heat meets cold deep water. Massive nutrient concentration. The richest fishing grounds on Hálcova. Fog-shrouded, difficult to navigate.

### Seasonal Variations

**Láng (Summer)**:
- Surface currents strongest (maximum heating)
- Ice retreat reveals more ocean surface
- Trade routes fully open
- Fish populations migrate with warm water

**Csend (Winter)**:
- Surface currents weakest
- Ice formation begins at high latitudes
- Currents may shift as ice blocks normal flows
- Some routes become impassable

**Olvadás (Thaw)**:
- Meltwater influx disrupts currents
- Unpredictable flows
- Dangerous for shipping (currents don't follow normal patterns)
- Rich nutrient release from melting ice
