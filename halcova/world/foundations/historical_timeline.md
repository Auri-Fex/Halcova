## The Warm Age (Before -50,000)

### What We Know

Almost nothing survives from this era. What exists:

**Physical Evidence:**
- Polar structures (both poles)
- Scattered ruins in inaccessible locations
- The Loom infrastructure itself
- Geometric patterns in certain rock formations

**Indirect Evidence:**
- The Loom's existence implies builders
- The moon arrangement implies engineering capability
- Linguistic fragments in ritual language

### What Likely Existed

Based on what they built, the Ancient Builders had:
- Planetary-scale engineering
- Understanding of pattern mechanics
- Ability to manipulate the Elsewhere boundary
- Population and resources to undertake massive projects

### The End

The Warm Age ended with the Transformation—the activation of the full Loom system, the cooling it caused, and the Builders' choice to upload themselves rather than die.

---

## The Transformation (~-50,000)

### The Event

In approximately 100 years:
1. The proto-Loom was activated at full scale
2. Pattern Residue began accumulating
3. Global temperatures began dropping
4. The Elsewhere noticed and pressed inward
5. The Builders transformed themselves into the Attendance
6. The Dissenter was imprisoned
7. The remaining population (those who didn't or couldn't transform) was left behind

### Immediate Aftermath

The non-transformed population faced:
- Rapid cooling (decades, not centuries)
- Collapse of all Builder infrastructure dependent on Builder maintenance
- Loss of all advanced knowledge
- Elsewhere incursions during the chaotic transition

### Survival

Small populations survived in:
- Geothermally active regions
- Coastal areas with maritime food sources
- Places with natural shelter
- Anywhere the Loom's local effects provided warmth

Population probably dropped from millions to tens of thousands.

---

## The Long Cold (-50,000 to -5,000)

### Characteristics

Forty-five thousand years of:
- Survival-level existence for most populations
- Gradual adaptation to the cold
- Loss and recovery of knowledge in cycles
- Slow population growth
- Minimal contact between isolated populations

### What We Don't Know

Almost no records survive from this period. It's too long. Oral traditions are unreliable across such spans. What fragments exist are mythologized beyond recognition.

### What Probably Happened

**Early Long Cold (-50,000 to -40,000):**
- Catastrophic population collapse
- Loss of almost all advanced knowledge
- Survival in isolated pockets
- Development of Residue-burning as heating method (necessity, not understanding)

**Middle Long Cold (-40,000 to -20,000):**
- Population stabilization
- First new cultures emerge
- Discovery/rediscovery of basic magic (the Five Arts in primitive form)
- Inter-group contact begins again

**Late Long Cold (-20,000 to -5,000):**
- Population growth accelerates
- Trade networks form
- First true settlements (not just survival camps)
- Organized societies emerge
- The Loom begins being used for prediction (not just existing)

### The Loom During the Long Cold

The Loom never stopped working. The Attendance persisted. But:
- No one understood what it was
- Use was instinctive/accidental
- The Attendance watched but rarely intervened
- Gradually, trial and error developed into ritual

---

## The Rebuilding (-5,000 to -500)

### Early Rebuilding (-5,000 to -3,000)

**The First Cities:**
- Permanent settlements of 5,000+ people
- Agricultural surplus enables specialization
- Writing re-emerges (multiple times, in different places)
- Formal magical practice develops

**Key Developments:**
- The Five Arts are codified and named
- First Loom-Keepers emerge as a profession
- Pattern-reading becomes systematic
- Trade networks span regions

**Major Centers:**
- Proto-Heartlands river valleys
- Vent Lands thermal settlements
- Shattered Reaches maritime cultures
- Each developed largely independently

### Middle Rebuilding (-3,000 to -1,500)

**The First States:**
- Multiple competing kingdoms in each region
- Warfare becomes organized
- Religious systems formalize
- The Loom becomes politically important

**The Pattern Wars (~-2,500 to -2,000):**
- First large-scale conflicts over Loom access
- Winner controls prediction = winner wins wars
- Consolidation of power around major Loom nodes
- Emergence of pattern-based social hierarchy

**Religious Development:**
- The Weaver concept emerges
- Multiple competing theologies
- First great temples built at Loom nodes
- Priestly classes gain power

### Late Rebuilding (-1,500 to -500)

**Regional Powers:**
- The Heartlands: Multiple kingdoms, frequent war, gradual consolidation
- The Reaches: Maritime confederacies, loose alliances
- The Vent Lands: Guild-cities, independent but cooperative
- The Middle Waters: Colonial territories, contested control
- The Far Shelf: Tribal territories, minimal state formation

**Magical Formalization:**
- The Five Arts fully documented
- First formal training institutions
- Practitioner classes emerge
- Legal frameworks for magic use

**Pre-Integration Crisis (~-600 to -500):**
- Major war involving multiple regions
- Unprecedented destruction
- Near-collapse of several states
- Creates conditions for Integration

---

## The Integration (-500 to 0)

### The Crisis That Started It (~-500)

The Pre-Integration War had devastated the Heartlands:
- Three major kingdoms destroyed
- Population reduced by ~30%
- Loom nodes damaged or contested
- Pattern-prediction failing due to chaos

### The Solution

A coalition of:
- Surviving Heartlands nobles
- Senior Loom-Keepers
- Powerful practitioners
- Vent Lands guild-masters

They proposed:
- Unified Loom administration
- Standardized pattern-reading
- Single legal framework
- Coordinated defense against Elsewhere

### Key Events

**The Concordat of Keepers (-487):**
- Loom-Keepers unified under single hierarchy
- Standardized training and ritual
- Central authority over pattern-interpretation

**The Founding of the Warden Order (-461):**
- Enforcement arm of the Concordat
- Authority to hunt deviants and heretics
- Pattern-orthodoxy as law

**The Crown Compact (-445):**
- Heartlands kingdoms unified under single crown
- Crown legitimacy tied to Loom endorsement
- Pattern-privileged status formalized in law

**The Maritime Agreements (-380 to -350):**
- Reaches confederacies accept Concordat authority (loosely)
- Trade standardization
- Shared Elsewhere defense

**The Guild Treaties (-320 to -280):**
- Vent Lands guilds integrated into system
- Special status for Flesh Shapers
- Technology sharing

**The Colonial Period (-250 to -50):**
- Middle Waters brought under Concordat influence
- Complex negotiations with existing powers
- Colony Host populations managed/contained

**The Far Shelf Expeditions (-100 to 0):**
- First systematic contact with Far Shelf populations
- Trade posts established
- Minimal political integration (too distant, too sparse)

### Year 0

The formal founding of the current order:
- Current Heartlands dynasty enthroned
- The Great Node at Fonváros completed
- The Concordat formalized in current structure
- All regions at least nominally integrated

---

## The Modern Era (0 to 476)

### Early Modern (0 to 150)

**Consolidation:**
- New order establishes itself
- Warden Order expands authority
- Resistance to integration suppressed
- Pattern-based class system entrenches

**The First Hollow Saint Movement (~80-120):**
- Religious dissent against Orthodox theology
- Suppressed violently
- Driven underground
- Establishes template for future movements

### Middle Modern (150 to 350)

**Stability:**
- The system works
- Population grows
- Trade flourishes
- The Arts are practiced within accepted limits

**The Threadist Reformation (~220-280):**
- Theological challenge to Orthodox interpretation
- Less radical than Hollow Saints
- Eventually tolerated as minor sect
- Creates space for limited religious diversity

**The Vent Lands Crisis (~290-310):**
- Guild power challenges Concordat authority
- Limited war
- Resolved with increased guild autonomy
- Establishes current Vent Lands status

**The Colony Plagues (~320-340):**
- Major Colony Host outbreak in Middle Waters
- Significant population loss
- Hardened attitudes toward Colony Hosts
- Current containment protocols established

### Late Modern (350 to Present)

**Expansion:**
- Far Shelf colonization intensifies
- New trade routes
- Increased Residue demand
- Population pressure on frontier

**The Orthodox Restoration (~380-420):**
- Conservative reaction to perceived laxity
- Warden Order expanded
- Persecution of deviants intensifies
- Current strict enforcement established

**Recent Events (~450 to Present):**
- Growing tension between regions
- Hollow Saint activity increasing
- Far Shelf resistance to colonial extraction
- Signs of Elsewhere activity increasing during Köd
- The prison degradation accelerating (unknown to most)

## Current Year: 476

### The Present Situation

**Political:**
- Heartlands Crown: Stable but aging monarch, succession uncertain
- Reaches Confederacy: Fractious, some islands seeking independence
- Vent Lands: Guild power at historical high, tension with Concordat
- Middle Waters: Colonial unrest, Colony Host population growing
- Far Shelf: Active resistance to Heartlands extraction

**Religious:**
- Orthodox dominance but facing challenges
- Threadist minority growing
- Hollow Saint cells more active than any time since founding
- Colony Cults spreading in Middle Waters

**Magical:**
- Practitioner population at historical high
- Deviation rates increasing
- Warden Order stretched thin
- Some Arts becoming harder to suppress

**Elsewhere:**
- Köd seasons slightly longer than historical average
- More entities manifesting during bleeds
- The Accountants more active than usual
- Something stirring at the poles

### The Future

The system has been stable for centuries. But:
- The prison is degrading
- Population is growing
- Resources are straining
- Dissent is increasing
- Elsewhere is pressing

The next century may see significant change—or the first major disruption since the Integration.
