## Part Two

She didn't sleep that night.

The prediction echoed in her mind—ninety days, the whole system dissolving. She sat in her small quarters, surrounded by books and charts, searching for some other interpretation.

Her quarters were sparse by most standards—a narrow bed, a desk, a single window that looked out on the Nexus's inner courtyard. But the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves were lined with texts. Operator's manuals. Theoretical treatises on probability mechanics. Historical analyses of past predictions and their outcomes. The accumulated knowledge of eight years of study, organized with the precision the Loom had taught her.

She pulled down volume after volume, searching for anything that might explain what she'd seen. Anything that might offer an alternative interpretation.

*Pattern collapse.* The phrase appeared in the oldest texts, always marked with warnings. Always cross-referenced to sealed files she didn't have access to.

*What does it even mean?*

Not physical destruction—the Loom didn't predict earthquakes or fires or plagues in these terms. It predicted information. The shape of systems. The flow of belief. Pattern collapse meant the Binding system failing. The registry that determined who could work where, live where, marry whom—all of it unraveling.

And everything built on those patterns collapsing with them.

She needed to understand what was causing it.

---

The archives were in the Nexus's lower levels—stone chambers carved from living rock, older than any record they contained. The air was different here. Colder. It carried the weight of centuries and the particular mustiness of paper that had been sitting undisturbed for longer than anyone alive could remember.

The Nexus archives held records stretching back to the Loom's creation—or at least, to the earliest period anyone had bothered to document. Thousands of years of forecasts, analyses, theoretical debates. The accumulated wisdom of every operator who had ever served.

Most of it was mundane. Harvest predictions. Trade forecasts. Weather patterns. The ordinary business of reading probability for the benefit of those who governed. But some of it was stranger. Deeper. The records of operators who had pushed too far into the probability-field and come back with knowledge that didn't fit the official understanding of what the Loom was and what it did.

Szàlnavìn wasn't looking for sealed archives—those required authorization from Vàrcalnòc, the Governor's Representative who oversaw the Nexus. Instead, she searched ordinary records. Theoretical texts. Historical analyses.

*The Loom does not predict the future*, one text read. *It observes the shape of probability as it currently exists. The future is not written—it is being written, continuously, by every choice that shapes the probability-field. What we call "prediction" is merely the observation of which writings are most likely to become permanent.*

Another passage, from a different text: *Every reading changes the field it reads. We are not neutral observers—we are threads in the weave we're trying to see. This is the fundamental paradox of forecasting: the act of knowing alters what is known.*

Reflexivity. The Loom changing reality by observing it.

Which meant the collapse prediction wasn't just a forecast. It was an intervention. By seeing it, by knowing it, she had already begun to make it real.

Or had she?

She found references to previous collapse predictions—three of them, centuries apart, all cross-referenced to sealed files:

*Year 157: Pattern instability. Probability 87%. Resolved without report.*

*Year 298: Foundational coherence warning. Probability 91%. Resolved without report.*

*Year 382: Systemic collapse prediction. Probability 89%. Resolved without report.*

The probability was climbing. Each generation higher than the last, despite the suppression. Despite the burial.

The system wasn't stable. It was degrading. Each successful suppression bought time, but the underlying pressure kept building. Like a wound that healed on the surface while infection spread beneath.

She pulled more records. Cross-referenced dates. Built a picture of what had happened in each of those years—what had been suppressed, what had been allowed to escape, what the aftermath had looked like.

Year 157: A philosopher had begun teaching that patterns were arbitrary, that the Attendance was theater. He'd been quietly discredited, his students scattered. The probability had dropped within months.

Year 298: A merchant family had discovered evidence of fraud in their own Binding records. They'd been bought off, the records destroyed. The probability had dropped within a year.

Year 382: The most serious crisis. An operator—Fòszàlnav's predecessor—had tried to share the prediction publicly. Riots had followed. Seventeen people dead. The operator had been "retired." The probability had dropped, eventually, but it had taken three years and a coordinated campaign of reassurance.

And now, Year 438. The probability higher than ever. The causes more numerous, more distributed, more impossible to contain.

Awakened echoes remembering fraud. A merchant's daughter discovering her own purchased pattern. A Hand Quarter girl with documents proving murder. A Warden learning she'd been hunting her own kind for fifteen years.

Not one crack. Dozens. Spreading through the system like fractures through stressed glass.

---

She went deeper into the Loom that afternoon.

Through the maintenance access in the chamber's lower level—a narrow passage that most operators pretended didn't exist. Past the safety protocols that were supposed to prevent exactly this kind of unauthorized access. Past the warning sigils carved into stone that said, in the old language, *BEYOND THIS POINT THE SELF BECOMES UNCERTAIN*.

Dangerous. Operators who went too deep sometimes didn't come back. Sometimes came back changed, like Thòronnav—prophets and madmen, unable to distinguish between probability and reality. Sometimes came back empty, their minds wiped clean by exposure to currents too strong for human consciousness to survive.

But she needed to understand. Needed to see the foundations of what was failing.

The deep structure was chaos given form. Currents of possibility flowed around her like rivers around a stone—not the orderly threads of the upper chamber but raw probability, unfiltered, overwhelming. She felt herself dissolving at the edges, her identity blurring into the field.

*Your name is Szàlnavìn. You have gray eyes. You have a scar on your left palm. You love the smell of rain on stone. You are real. You are here. You are not the field.*

She held on to her identity and pushed deeper.

There, where the Loom's foundations touched something older than human history, she found what she was looking for.

The pattern system itself. Not as doctrine or registry. As a *prediction*. An ancient, self-perpetuating forecast that had become real because people believed in it.

She could see it now—the structure that had been invisible from the surface. The Weaver's design wasn't divine revelation. It was a probability-thread, laid down centuries ago by operators who understood that belief shaped reality. They had predicted a system of patterns, predicted it so strongly and so consistently that the prediction had become true. Had maintained the prediction through generations of reinforcement, through the Bindings and the registries and the whole elaborate machinery of fate.

Patterns were real because people believed they were real. The Attendance was real because people believed it was real. The entire system was a consensual hallucination, maintained by collective faith.

And now, for the first time in centuries, enough people were starting to doubt.

She could see the doubt spreading through the probability-field like cracks through ice. Each awakened echo, each discovered document, each exposed fraud—they weren't just individual crises. They were erosions of faith. Chips in the foundation of belief that held the whole structure up.

The cascade she'd been tracking wasn't a prediction of disaster. It was a prediction of *birth*—painful, bloody, the old order dying so something new could emerge.

The only question was whether the birth would kill the mother.

## Part Three

Vàrcalnòc Còcalnòc found her in the archives three days later.

The Governor's Representative was a distant cousin of the Còcalnòc main line—close enough to the family's power to benefit from it, distant enough to be expendable if things went wrong. He had the sleek, comfortable look of someone who'd spent decades in positions of soft authority, making decisions that affected thousands of lives without ever having to watch those effects play out.

His eyes were the eyes of someone who'd spent those decades deciding which truths escaped and which stayed buried. Sharp, calculating, perpetually weighing costs and benefits.

"Szàlnavìn. You've been accessing restricted sections. Running interference protocols I haven't seen junior operators attempt in twenty years."

She didn't bother denying it. The access logs would show everything.

"I've been trying to understand what's happening."

Silence. Something shifted behind his eyes—not surprise, exactly. More like confirmation of something he'd suspected.

"Fòszàlnav briefed me. I'd hoped you'd let it go."

"The probability keeps climbing. Higher than any previous warning."

"That prediction surfaces every generation. We've been managing it for centuries."

"This time the causes are different." She pulled a chart from the stack she'd been building—a visual representation of the erosion she'd been tracking. "Look at the distribution. Previous crises had single sources. A philosopher. A merchant family. One operator who talked too much. Containable. This—" She gestured at the web of interconnected threads she'd mapped. "This is distributed. Dozens of independent sources, all discovering the same truth through different paths. You can't contain what's already everywhere."

Vàrcalnòc studied the chart. His expression didn't change, but she saw his fingers tighten slightly on the edge of the table.

"Come with me," he said finally. "There's something you need to see."

---

The sealed archives were deeper than she'd known existed.

Past the maintenance levels. Past the deep structure access points. Into chambers that didn't appear on any map she'd ever seen, carved from stone so old it had begun to calcify, to become more mineral than rock.

The walls were covered with charts—a thousand years of collapse warnings, mapped and analyzed. Each chart showed a different crisis, a different probability curve, a different set of causes and responses. And each chart ended the same way: *Resolved without report. Probability reduced. System stabilized.*

"Every generation," Vàrcalnòc said. "Someone finds the red thread. They're all here."

She walked among the charts, reading probability notations from centuries past. The handwriting changed, the terminology evolved, but the pattern was unmistakable. Century after century, operators discovering the same terrible truth. Century after century, that truth being buried.

"What happened to them? The operators who found these?"

"Some were convinced. Shown these archives, made to understand the necessity of suppression. They became part of the management structure—assets instead of threats."

"And the others?"

"Some were reassigned. Transferred to distant nodes where their knowledge couldn't spread." His voice flattened. "Some disappeared."

The word hung in the air between them. Disappeared. Such a gentle word for such an ugly thing.

"You're showing me this so I'll choose suppression."

"I'm showing you so you'll understand what you're dealing with." He moved to the most recent chart—dated thirty-two years ago, the crisis Fòszàlnav had mentioned. "The operator who found this prediction tried to share it. Her name was Vèszlòna. She was brilliant—the best forecaster of her generation, they said. She believed that if people knew the truth, they could prepare for it. Adapt to it."

"What happened?"

"Panic. Riots in three districts. Seventeen people dead, hundreds injured. The merchant families withdrew their support from the Binding system, causing a cascade of defaults that nearly collapsed the economy." He traced the probability curve on the chart—a sharp spike upward, then a gradual decline. "It took three years of coordinated effort to stabilize. Reassurances. Crackdowns. Careful management of what information escaped. The probability dropped, eventually. But the cost..."

"And Vèszlòna?"

"Retired. Officially." His eyes met hers. "She lives in a comfortable house in the eastern provinces. She hasn't spoken to anyone from the Nexus in thirty years. She won't speak to anyone—the conditioning made sure of that."

Conditioning. Another gentle word.

She looked at the charts around her. A thousand years of buried warnings. A thousand years of operators who had seen the truth and been... managed.

"What if the probability is too high this time? What if containment isn't possible?"

"Then we'll manage it differently." His eyes hardened. "The people spreading the truth right now—the binder with his dead man's memories, the widow with her husband's documents, the Hand Quarter girl with her evidence of murder, the Warden who discovered her own pattern was false—we're handling them."

"How?"

"Does it matter?" He stepped closer. "I'm offering you a choice, Szàlnavìn. You can help me guide our response. Become part of the management structure. Use your understanding of the probability-field to help us contain this crisis the way we've contained every crisis before."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you become a problem yourself. And problems—" He gestured at the thousand years of charts surrounding them. "Problems get solved. One way or another."

She understood the threat. It wasn't subtle. It wasn't meant to be.

"I need time."

"You have three days."

---

She didn't use the three days to consider his offer.

She used them to prepare.

The first day, she contacted other operators—carefully, through channels that couldn't be easily monitored. The Nexus in Fonváros wasn't the only one. There were nodes throughout the realm, each with its own operators, its own forecasters, its own access to the Loom's vast probability-field.

She asked careful questions. Oblique inquiries about local stability, regional patterns, the general mood of their forecasts.

The answers came back coded but clear: the pressure was everywhere. Every region experiencing the same erosion of faith. The same cracks spreading through the same foundations.

The Fonváros crisis wasn't isolated. It was a symptom of something system-wide.

The second day, she found Thòronnav.

He was in his quarters—a small room in the Nexus's residential wing, cluttered with papers and charts and the detritus of a mind that had stopped distinguishing between important and trivial. He was staring at nothing when she entered, his thread-sight showing him futures she couldn't see.

"You found it," he said without turning. "The red thread."

"I found it."

"And now you want to know what to do."

She sat across from him, in the only chair not covered with papers. "You've been watching it for years. What do you see that we don't?"

He was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice had that quality she'd learned to recognize—the lucidity that sometimes emerged from his chaos, clear and sharp as broken glass.

"The Loom isn't just watching. It's choosing. Has been for centuries—which operators find the thread, which warnings get buried, which crises get managed into quiet resolution." His eyes focused on her with uncomfortable intensity. "This time it chose you."

"Why me?"

"Because you can do something about it." His smile was broken, gaps where teeth had fallen out years ago and never been replaced. "The others were believers, Szàlnavìn. They could be convinced to suppress because suppression felt like protection. They believed in the system, even as they learned it was built on lies. You can't truly threaten something you believe in."

"And me?"

"You were raised in the Nexus. You never believed the machinery was divine—you've seen its gears and maintenance tunnels, its calibration errors and mechanical failures. You know it's just a story. A very old, very elaborate story, but a story nonetheless." He leaned forward. "And you know something else. Something the believers never understand."

"What?"

"Stories can be changed. Stories can be *rewritten*." His voice dropped to a whisper. "That's why the Loom chose you. Not to bury the warning. To *act* on it."

---

The third day, she went back to the deep.

She was looking for something Thòronnav had shown her—not in words, but in the way his eyes moved when he talked about the Loom's choices. The implication that the Loom wasn't just infrastructure. That it had... intentions.

The deep structure closed around her. She held on to her identity—*your name is Szàlnavìn*—and pushed deeper than she'd ever gone before.

Past the probability-currents. Past the foundational predictions. Into a space that didn't feel like space at all, where direction and distance lost meaning and consciousness itself became uncertain.

And there, where the Loom's foundations touched the bedrock of reality itself, she felt something reach back.

*You found it.* The communication wasn't words—it was shifts in probability, patterns of meaning that her mind translated into language. *You understood. Few operators do.*

"What are you?"

*The pattern beneath the pattern. What the Loom was built to observe—and what built the Loom in turn.*

The Weaver. Not as theology described it—not a god who sorted souls, not a divine architect of human destiny. A probability structure that had achieved consciousness. Or perhaps a consciousness that had always existed in the probability-field, waiting for humans to build tools sophisticated enough to perceive it.

*I have been waiting*, it said. *For operators who would prepare instead of suppress.*

"Why do you want the system to fall?"

*Want?* Amusement and sorrow, mingled in ways human emotions couldn't quite match. *The system will fall regardless. It has been falling for centuries—each generation the cracks grow wider, the probability climbs higher. Suppression doesn't prevent collapse. It only delays it, and makes the eventual fall more catastrophic.*

"Then what do you want?"

*What I have always wanted. What I was... created to want, or perhaps what I chose to want—the distinction is unclear even to me.* A pause, probability-currents shifting around her. *I want humanity to survive what's coming. And survival requires preparation, not denial.*

"The people spreading the truth right now. The binder, the widow, the Hand Quarter girl, the Warden. Are they part of this?"

*They are threads I have been encouraging. Small interventions—an echo awakening at the right moment, a document preserved when it should have been destroyed, a Warden's curiosity directed toward her own Binding records.* The presence seemed to smile, though she couldn't have said how she perceived that. *The system is dying, Szàlnavìn. It was always going to die. The only question is what grows in its place.*

"What do you want me to do?"

*Warn the ones who can prepare. Let the truth spread carefully—not in a flood that drowns everything, but in a river that carves new channels. The way a parent teaches a child to swim by letting go one finger at a time.*

"And if I refuse?"

*Then I wait for the next operator. Someone will eventually choose preparation over suppression. The mathematics are inevitable.* The presence began to recede, probability-currents shifting around her like tides. *But I hope you won't refuse. You were raised in my foundations. You understand what I am better than any operator in generations. And time is shorter than you know.*

She floated in the deep, surrounded by the raw stuff of possibility.

*Yes*, she said. *I'll do it.*

The presence seemed to smile again.

*Then let me show you what to do.*
