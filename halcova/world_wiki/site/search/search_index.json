The formal High H\u00e1lcovan taught in schools and used in official contexts differs significantly from the living speech of streets, taverns, and homes. Slang, idioms, and vernacular expressions reveal how ordinary people understand and navigate their world\u2014often subverting official meanings while using official vocabulary. This document catalogs contemporary informal language: the expressions pattern-privileged nobles use among themselves, the coded speech of criminals, the bitter humor of the constrained, and the regional variations that mark speakers' origins.

It is not a single machine but a system\u2014part arcane technology, part religious practice, part bureaucratic apparatus. More importantly: The Loom may be a point of contact with Fate itself. Whether Fate is an Elsewhere entity, a collection of entities, or something stranger is a matter of fierce theological debate. What's undeniable is that The Loom works . Its predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance. And something answers when the Loom-Keepers perform their divinations. Historical Origins: The Bootstrap Question The Fundamental Problem The Loom runs on Pattern Residue. Pattern Residue comes from death. But the Loom (or something like it) appears to predate the current Residue economy. The polar structures, the moon arrangement, and certain archaeological evidence suggest the system existed before the cooling event that created the death-dependent world we know. How did the Loom start if it needs death to run, but death (at scale) required the conditions the Loom may have created? The Three-Phase Model Scholars who study this question propose a developmental sequence: Phase 1: The Proto-Loom (Pre-Cooling) The ancient builders created the system's foundation using unknown power sources: - The polar structures were built - The moons were arranged into resonance - The Attendance (or something that became it) was contacted/created/summoned - This phase did not require Pattern Residue\u2014or used Residue from sources we don't understand - The technology and knowledge from this era is lost Phase 2: The Cooling Event (Transition) Something happened that changed everything: - Massive Residue release (mass death? Elsewhere incursion? deliberate engineering?) - The net-negative thermodynamic cycle began - H\u00e1lcova started cooling rapidly - The pattern-economy emerged as Residue became available at scale - The ancient builders disappeared (died? transformed? departed?) Phase 3: The Current Era The Loom we know is an adaptation, not the original design: - Pattern-engines run on Residue because that's what's available - The distributed Node network was built over millennia by successor civilizations - The core function (the Attendance connection) may not actually require Residue - The infrastructure (Nodes, engines, rituals) does require Residue - Current operators maintain the system without understanding its origins What This Means The Attendance Is Older Than The Engines Whatever answers Loom queries existed before the current infrastructure. The pattern-engines are interfaces, not sources. Destroy every Node, and the Attendance might still be there\u2014just unreachable. The Residue Dependency Is Acquired The original system didn't need death. The current system does because it was rebuilt by people who only had death-energy available. This is adaptation, not design. The Builders Knew More The ancient builders understood something we don't. They created (or contacted) the Attendance. They arranged the moons. They built structures that still function after 40,000+ years. Their power source and methods are lost. What The Loom Is The Physical Infrastructure Loom-Nodes Distributed across H\u00e1lcova, Loom-Nodes are the physical anchors of the system: Major Nodes : Large installations in capital cities and religious centers. Cathedral-sized complexes housing pattern-engines, archives, and ritual spaces. Staffed by hundreds of Loom-Keepers. Minor Nodes : Town-level facilities. Smaller pattern-engines, local registries, drawing chambers. Staffed by licensed practitioners and temple appointees. Mobile Nodes : Portable equipment for frontier regions, military operations, and emergency readings. Less accurate but functional. Private Nodes : Illegal or gray-market installations operated by wealthy individuals, corporations, and criminal organizations. Quality varies wildly. The Pattern-Engines At the heart of each Node is a pattern-engine\u2014a device that: Records S\u00f3rscad data from drawings Performs predictive calculations Communicates with other Nodes (major ones only) Interfaces with... something. The source of The Loom's impossible accuracy. Pattern-engines are part clockwork, part alchemical apparatus, part something that defies categorization. Their construction is a closely guarded secret. Their fuel is Pattern Residue\u2014the same substance that maintains echo anchors. The Institutional Structure The Loom-Keepers A guild-priesthood that operates The Loom. They are: Trained in pattern-reading, engine operation, and ritual practice Licensed by both religious and civil authorities Bound by oaths that constrain their use of Loom-knowledge Organized hierarchically from apprentices to High Weavers Loom-Keepers occupy an ambiguous social position. They're essential to governance, commerce, and religion. They're also viewed with suspicion\u2014people who know too much about everyone else's fate. The Registry The accumulated database of all S\u00f3rscad patterns ever drawn. Stored in: Physical archives (paper, metal plates, encoded materials) Pattern-engine memory (poorly understood how this works) Distributed across major Nodes with varying levels of completeness The Registry is legally protected, politically contested, and practically impossible to fully secure. Pattern-theft, registry-manipulation, and archive-raids are all documented crimes. The Calculation Houses Secondary institutions that use Loom data for specific purposes: Actuarial Houses : Insurance and risk pricing Credit Temples : Lending and debt assessment Merchant Guilds : Employment screening and partner evaluation Legal Colleges : Sentencing guidance and contract validity Military Orders : Recruitment and tactical prediction These institutions license Loom access from the Keepers. The fees are substantial. The data is invaluable. What The Loom Does Pattern Recording When a S\u00f3rscad is drawn, The Loom: Captures the pattern through ritual interface with the pattern-engine Records the five-circle combination in the Registry Indexes the pattern by family, region, lineage, and other metadata Transmits (major Nodes only) the record to the central archives The drawing ritual itself involves the pattern-engine. The subject touches interface plates while a Loom-Keeper performs the ceremonial reading. What happens during those moments is described differently by different traditions, but the result is consistent: a legible S\u00f3rscad, recorded and indexed. Prediction Given a person's S\u00f3rscad, The Loom can calculate: Life-arc probabilities : Likely career paths, relationship patterns, death-circumstances Decision tendencies : How they'll respond to specific choice-types Risk profiles : Probability of crime, default, illness, violence Compatibility assessments : How two patterns will interact in partnership, employment, or conflict The predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic. The Loom says \"73% likelihood of early violent death,\" not \"you will die by the sword at age 34.\" But the probabilities are accurate . Eerily accurate. Accurate enough that institutions stake fortunes on them. Deviation Detection The Loom tracks when actual outcomes diverge from predictions: Minor deviations : Within expected variance, noted but not flagged Significant deviations : Outside normal variance, flagged for review Anomalous deviations : Statistically improbable, triggering investigation Deviation can indicate: - Measurement error (rare) - Environmental factors not in the model (common, usually ignored) - Deliberate pattern-manipulation (criminal) - Something outside Fate's purview (theologically troubling) The Source: Fate as Entity The Orthodox Position Orthodox theology holds that The Loom reads the will of The Weaver ( A Sz\u00f6v\u0151 )\u2014the divine pattern-maker who determines all fates before birth. The Loom doesn't predict; it reveals . The pattern-engines don't calculate; they receive . Loom-Keepers don't read fate; they translate divine truth into mortal language. Deviation from your pattern isn't bad luck. It's sin. Acceptance of your pattern isn't fatalism. It's worship. The Heterodox Suspicion Critics and heretics have long suspected that The Loom's accuracy comes from somewhere specific: The Elsewhere Connection The Loom's impossible predictive power suggests contact with something beyond normal causality. The Elsewhere entities operate outside time, reference events that haven't happened, and seem to understand fate in ways mortals cannot. Possible relationships: Fate IS an Elsewhere entity (or entities). The Weaver is real, but it's not a god\u2014it's an Elsewhere faction with interest in our world's pattern-structure. The Loom is a pact . The original Loom-builders made a deal, knowingly or not. The pattern-engines are anchors. The accuracy is the entity's end of the bargain. What do they receive in return? Pattern Residue is payment . The fuel that runs the engines might also be tribute to the entity/entities that make prediction possible. The Accountants . The Elsewhere faction obsessed with ledgers, debts, and balance fits suspiciously well with a system that tracks life-patterns and predicts outcomes. Did they design this? Do they operate it? What The Loom-Keepers Know Senior Loom-Keepers are aware that something answers their rituals. They call this presence by various names: The Voice in the Engine The Pattern-Behind-Pattern The Weaver's Hand The Attendance They know: - It responds more strongly to certain rituals than others - It seems interested in specific patterns (deviation cases especially) - It occasionally provides information not requested - It has never harmed a Keeper during proper operation - Improper operation has consequences They don't know: - What it actually is - What it wants (beyond continued operation) - Whether it's one entity or many - Whether it's benevolent, malevolent, or indifferent - What happens if The Loom ever stops working This uncertainty is not shared with the public. The Orthodoxy maintains that The Loom reads divine will. The Loom-Keepers maintain whatever story keeps the system running. The Accuracy Problem Why Does It Work? The Loom's predictions are accurate far beyond what statistical modeling should allow. Even accounting for: - Feedback loops (predictions creating outcomes) - Self-fulfilling prophecy (people acting on expectations) - Survivorship bias (failures not tracked) The accuracy remains anomalous. People with Road-Path patterns really do tend toward linear careers. People with Blade-H\u00e1lmaht patterns really do die violently at elevated rates. The correlation is too strong to be coincidence. Possible explanations: 1. Fate is real and The Loom reads it correctly - The pattern exists independent of The Loom - The Loom is just a measurement tool - Accuracy reflects underlying reality 2. The Loom creates what it predicts - The measurement itself shapes the outcome - Social structures enforce pattern-expectations - Fate is constructed, not discovered 3. Something makes the predictions come true - The Elsewhere entity/entities actively arrange outcomes - The Loom's accuracy is maintained by intervention - We're not being predicted; we're being managed 4. Some combination - Patterns reflect real tendencies - The Loom's measurement amplifies those tendencies - External forces ensure accuracy where natural variance would cause deviation The truth is probably all four. The horror is that it might not matter\u2014the system works regardless of why. The Bias That Serves Power The Loom is accurate. But accurate about what? The training data\u2014centuries of Registry records\u2014reflects: - Historical power structures - Past discrimination patterns - Environmental factors misattributed to innate patterns - Feedback loops already embedded The Loom predicts that Knot-Born patterns are high-risk. This is accurate\u2014they do commit more crimes, default more often, die violently more frequently. But why? Because: - They're born into poverty - They're denied opportunity - They're policed more heavily - They're priced out of legitimate paths The Loom sees the outcome and attributes it to the pattern. The pattern becomes a prediction. The prediction justifies the treatment. The treatment creates the outcome. This is not a bug. The Loom reflects the world accurately. The world is structured to produce these outcomes. The Loom validates that structure. Pattern Residue: The Fuel What It Is Pattern Residue (working term\u2014conlang name TBD) is the energy released when patterns dissolve. When something with a S\u00f3rscad dies: - The pattern loses its anchor - The five circles begin to dissipate - Energy is released during dissolution - This energy can be captured and stored Where It Comes From Natural Sources : - Any death of a pattern-bearing creature - More from traumatic deaths (violent release) - More from heavy patterns (rich fate-weight) - Concentrated at mass-death sites (battlefields, plagues, disasters) Manufactured Sources : - Executions (legal, controlled harvest) - Blood-sport (entertainment plus production) - War (the most efficient source) - Plague management (letting outbreaks run for harvest) - Livestock (animal patterns are weaker but abundant) What It Does For The Loom : - Powers pattern-engines - Fuels divination rituals - Enables Node-to-Node communication - Maintains the connection to... whatever answers For Core Binding : - Maintains echo coherence in anchors - Prevents degradation and fragmentation - Consumed over time (ongoing cost) - Higher-quality Residue produces more stable echoes For Other Uses : - Alchemical applications (numerous) - Probability-nudging devices (expensive, unreliable) - Magitech fuel (emerging industry) - Black market applications (various) The Economy of Death Pattern Residue creates incentives: - Peace is expensive (low Residue production) - War is profitable (high production, controllable harvest) - Disaster is opportunity (mass death = market surplus) - Certain populations are more valuable dead than alive (high-pattern individuals) The institutions that depend on Residue have interests in: - Maintaining death rates - Controlling Residue sources - Preventing peace from becoming too stable - Managing scarcity to maintain prices This is not conspiracy theory. This is economics. The people who run these systems are not monsters. They're administrators responding to incentives. The monstrousness is structural. The Net-Negative Reality Pattern Residue doesn't just absorb heat\u2014it permanently removes it. Every death: - Absorbs thermal energy during Residue formation - Even when burned, releases only 60-70% of that energy - The remainder is lost forever (exotic matter decay, Elsewhere transfer) This means: - The Loom's fuel supply comes at planetary cost - Running the system requires accepting ongoing heat loss - The more queries, the more death needed, the colder the world becomes - The original builders either didn't know this, didn't care, or had a reason Regional Distribution The Loom is not uniform across H\u00e1lcova. Different regions have different relationships with the system. Core Regions (High Integration) Dense Node coverage High Registry completeness Strong Orthodoxy presence Loom-based governance dominant These regions trust The Loom because The Loom serves their interests. The pattern-privileged are concentrated here. The predictions validate their power. Peripheral Regions (Moderate Integration) Sparse Node coverage Incomplete registries Mixed religious presence Loom as one factor among many These regions use The Loom pragmatically. It's a tool, not a religion. Local knowledge competes with Loom-predictions. Deviation is more common and less prosecuted. Frontier Regions (Low Integration) Minimal Node presence (mobile units only) Highly incomplete registries Heterodox or non-Loom religions dominant Loom as foreign imposition These regions resist The Loom for practical and cultural reasons. Being un-registered is common. Pattern-reading is viewed with suspicion. Local systems of fate-understanding compete or dominate. Contested Regions (Variable) Integration depends on current power structure Registries may be destroyed, rebuilt, falsified Religious authority in flux Loom as political battleground In these regions, controlling The Loom is controlling the population. Registration drives are military operations. Pattern data is intelligence. The Loom is a weapon. Attitudes Toward The Loom Universal Acceptance of Accuracy Across H\u00e1lcova, virtually no one disputes that The Loom's predictions are accurate. The evidence is too overwhelming. Even those who hate the system acknowledge that it works. Disagreement is about: - Why it works - Whether accuracy justifies the system - Who should control it - What deviations mean Cultural Variations The Faithful : The Loom reveals divine will. Acceptance is worship. Deviation is sin. The system is sacred. The Pragmatists : The Loom is accurate and useful. Don't ask why. Use the predictions, manage the risks, don't overthink. The Reformers : The Loom is accurate but misused. The problem isn't prediction\u2014it's discrimination based on prediction. Fix the institutions, not the math. The Skeptics : The Loom is accurate because it creates what it predicts. It's self-fulfilling prophecy dressed as divination. The system makes itself true. The Conspiracists : The Loom is accurate because something is making it true. We're not being predicted\u2014we're being controlled. The system is a cage. None of these positions deny accuracy. They interpret it differently.

The Five Circles 1. L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 (Core/Soul Circle) Pronunciation : LAY-il-croo Domain : Your essence. What makes you you . The seat of identity and consciousness. Magical Significance : - Core Binding targets this circle\u2014when you bind an echo, you're trapping their L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 pattern - Pact Summoning consumes this circle\u2014Elsewhere entities eat it in installments - This is what survives death briefly, what becomes the core that Binders harvest When Drawn : Natal Draw (birth/early infancy) What It Reveals : Your fundamental nature, how you perceive yourself, the core of your identity Cards : [To be developed\u2014archetypes like Lantern (introspective), Mask (performative), Mirror (reflective), Anchor (fixed), Crown (authoritative), Wound (defensive), Husk (hollowed), Echo (inherited), Shard (fragmented), Spark (emergent)] 2. H\u00faslaimh (Flesh/Body Circle) Pronunciation : HOOSH-lahv Domain : Your physical form. Your appetites, limitations, relationship with your body. Magical Significance : - Flesh Shaping draws from this circle\u2014blood-cost is spending your H\u00faslaimh - Colony Hosting transforms this circle\u2014the fungal symbiote rewrites your flesh-pattern - This determines physical fate: health, vitality, manner of bodily existence When Drawn : Natal Draw (birth/early infancy) What It Reveals : Your physical nature, appetites, bodily relationship, material existence Cards : [To be developed\u2014archetypes related to body types, physical drives, material relationships] 3. C\u00f3itcai (Binding/Connection Circle) Pronunciation : KOYT-kai Domain : Your relationships. How you attach to people, institutions, obligations. Magical Significance : - All Five Arts create bindings that register in this circle - Social contracts, debts, and obligations live here - The Loom tracks relationship patterns through this circle When Drawn : Binding Draw (adolescence) What It Reveals : How you form attachments, your relationship patterns, social nature Cards : [To be developed\u2014archetypes like Pact (contractual), Chain (obligatory), Web (networked), Hearth (intimate), Blade (adversarial), Thorn (painful), Twin (mirrored), Flock (collective), Ward (protective), Maskline (hidden)] 4. H\u00e1lmaht (Death/End Circle) Pronunciation : HAHL-maht Domain : Your mortality. How you relate to endings, what you fear, how you'll meet your end. Magical Significance : - This is what Elsewhere entities ultimately want\u2014the final pattern-release - Core Binding captures this at the moment of death - Determines the quality and character of the core that remains When Drawn : Natal Draw (birth/early infancy) What It Reveals : Your relationship with mortality, fears, how you face endings Cards : [To be developed\u2014archetypes related to death-relationships, fear patterns, ending-styles] 5. S\u00f3rscad (Fate/Path Circle) Pronunciation : SORE-skahd Domain : Your trajectory. How you make decisions, move through life, the shape of your journey. Magical Significance : - Fate Threading directly harvests this circle\u2014each extraction severs future paths - The Loom primarily reads this circle for predictive purposes - Most visible to pattern-readers, most valuable for speculation When Drawn : Binding Draw (adolescence) What It Reveals : Your decision-making style, life trajectory, how you navigate choices Cards : [To be developed\u2014archetypes like Road (linear), Ladder (hierarchical), Crossroads (pivoting), Maze (convoluted), Spiral (cyclical), Bridge (connecting), Hunt (pursuing), Drift (reactive), Orbit (circling), Break (rupturing)] How a S\u00f3rscad Is Drawn Two-Stage Process Stage 1: Natal Draw (Birth/Early Infancy) Three circles are drawn: - L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 (Core): Your essential nature - H\u00faslaimh (Flesh): Your physical being - H\u00e1lmaht (Death): Your mortality pattern These represent what you are \u2014the given, the innate, the starting conditions. The Natal Draw is typically: - Performed by a licensed pattern-reader - Recorded in temple and civil registries - Sometimes shared with parents, sometimes kept sealed until Binding Day Stage 2: Binding Draw (Adolescence, typically 13-16) Two circles are drawn: - C\u00f3itcai (Binding): Your relationship patterns - S\u00f3rscad (Fate): Your trajectory and decision-style These represent what you become \u2014the developed, the social, the chosen. The Binding Draw is: - A major life ritual in most cultures - The moment you become \"legible\" to The Loom as a full actor - Often accompanied by ceremony, celebration, or dread depending on culture and class Predictive Power Distribution Why the Natal Three Dominate Early Assessment The Natal Draw circles (L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9, H\u00faslaimh, H\u00e1lmaht) provide approximately 75-80% of predictive power for major life outcomes. This is why pattern-based decisions can be made before the Binding Draw: Circle Predictive Contribution What It Predicts L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 (Core) ~30% Identity stability, resilience, decision-making foundation H\u00faslaimh (Flesh) ~25% Health outcomes, physical capability, longevity baseline H\u00e1lmaht (Death) ~20-25% Mortality risk, manner of death, relationship with endings C\u00f3itcai (Binding) ~10-12% Relationship patterns, social outcomes, institutional fit S\u00f3rscad (Fate) ~10-12% Trajectory shape, decision style, path characteristics What the Binding Circles Add The two Binding circles (C\u00f3itcai, S\u00f3rscad) refine predictions rather than overturn them: - They specify how someone will navigate life, not what they fundamentally are - They predict relationship patterns and decision-making style - They improve accuracy on social outcomes, career trajectory, and partnership compatibility - They rarely produce \"surprises\"\u2014a Natal Draw suggesting success usually sees a confirming Binding Draw The Childhood Assessment Problem How do institutions make decisions about children before Binding Draw? The Natal Three Are Sufficient for Most Purposes : Health assessments, mortality risk, educational placement, and early intervention all depend primarily on L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9, H\u00faslaimh, and H\u00e1lmaht. Provisional Estimates : Experienced readers can provisionally assess likely C\u00f3itcai and S\u00f3rscad ranges based on family patterns, district statistics, and the Natal Three configuration. These aren't official but inform decisions. Conservative Assumptions : Institutions assume mid-range Binding circles unless evidence suggests otherwise. This systematically disadvantages pattern-constrained children (bad Natal reads assumed to worsen) and advantages pattern-privileged children (good Natal reads assumed to hold). The Binding Revelation : Occasionally, a Binding Draw reveals something unexpected\u2014a C\u00f3itcai or S\u00f3rscad that doesn't match family patterns or Natal predictions. These \"surprises\" are rare (perhaps 5-10% of draws) but culturally significant. They become stories of unexpected rise or fall. Why This Matters The two-stage draw creates a false sense of openness: - \"Your fate isn't sealed until Binding Day!\" - In reality, 75-80% is determined at birth - The Binding Draw usually confirms what the Natal Draw suggested - But the ritual maintains hope\u2014and compliance\u2014during childhood The Hybrid Algorithm: Random vs. Weighted In a purely random system, there would be 10\u2075 = 100,000 possible combinations. But H\u00e1lcova is not purely random. The Draw Has Two Components : Unweighted Component : Truly random selection from all ten cards Weighted Component : Selection biased by district, class, lineage, and local conditions The Balance : - Typically 2-3 circles lean heavily unweighted (individual variance) - Typically 2 circles are locally weighted (structural constraint) - Which circles are weighted varies by region and institution Example: Industrial District Weighting A district characterized by dangerous labor, poverty, and exploitation might show: - H\u00faslaimh skew: More Iron/Stone (resilient), fewer Silk/Glass (delicate) - S\u00f3rscad skew: More Drift/Maze (reactive, convoluted), fewer Road/Ladder (linear, ascending) - H\u00e1lmaht skew: More Threshold/Blade (violent ends), fewer Rest/Fade (peaceful endings) Individuals still vary, but as a population, the district's patterns cluster in \"riskier\" territory. The Feedback Loop : The Loom sees these patterns and calculates higher risk for the district. This justifies: - Higher insurance rates - Lower credit access - More aggressive policing - Fewer investments These conditions create the very outcomes the patterns \"predicted,\" which The Loom reads as confirmation. This is not a bug. This is how the system maintains itself. Pattern Families People don't recite all five cards in conversation. They reference families \u2014recognized combinations with cultural names. Example Families \"Steadfasts\" - Lantern L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9, Iron H\u00faslaimh, Pact C\u00f3itcai, Threshold H\u00e1lmaht, Road S\u00f3rscad - Seen as: reliable, predictable, good workers, unimaginative - The Loom rates them: low variance, low ceiling, low risk \"Knot-Born\" - Wound L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9, Stone H\u00faslaimh, Thorn C\u00f3itcai, Blade H\u00e1lmaht, Maze S\u00f3rscad - Seen as: trouble, criminals, dangerous - The Loom rates them: high variance, unpredictable, high risk - In their own communities: survivors, \"our people,\" those who endured \"Storm-Touched\" - Spark L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9, Glass H\u00faslaimh, Twin C\u00f3itcai, Threshold H\u00e1lmaht, Break S\u00f3rscad - Seen as: brilliant but unstable, romanticized in stories, distrusted in institutions - The Loom rates them: extreme variance, difficult to employ, interesting to speculators Why Families Matter : They become stereotypes in law, hiring, and everyday prejudice Policies target families, not individuals Pattern-arbitrageurs look for \"mis-priced\" families\u2014people whose actual capability exceeds their family's reputation Interactions with The Five Arts Core Binding and L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 When you bind an echo, you're trapping their L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 pattern in your anchor. The echo retains its original pattern (which is why it still thinks it's alive) Bleed occurs because carrying another's pattern contaminates your own Long-term binders show \"layered\" L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9\u2014ghost-traces of everyone they've carried The Loom reads them as \"pattern-unstable\" Strategic Implications : - Some binders deliberately acquire echoes with complementary patterns - \"Pattern-balancing\" is a trade\u2014acquiring specific echoes to shift your own Loom-profile - Illegal, of course, but widely practiced Flesh Shaping and H\u00faslaimh Flesh Shaping draws from your H\u00faslaimh circle. Homunculi have no S\u00f3rscad (never born, never drawn) But they're made from your H\u00faslaimh, carrying echoes of your flesh-pattern Long-term Shapers show \"erosion\" in their H\u00faslaimh\u2014The Loom sees them hollowing out Eventually they're more pattern-absence than pattern-presence in that circle Strategic Implications : - Homunculi are invisible to The Loom (no pattern to track) - Valuable for operations requiring prediction-avoidance - Shapers themselves become increasingly predictable as their H\u00faslaimh simplifies Pact Summoning and L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 (Consumption) Pact Summoning consumes your L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9\u2014the same circle Core Binding traps. Elsewhere entities eat your core-pattern in installments As you pay, your L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 fades \u2014The Loom reads you as \"pattern-light\" Heavily-indebted summoners barely register as people in the system Substitution works because entities want pattern-weight , not specifically yours Strategic Implications : - Pact summoners disappear from predictions as they pay their debts - They become \"fate-attenuated\"\u2014hard to target, hard to predict, hard to hold accountable - Some seek this deliberately as a form of freedom from the system Fate Threading and S\u00f3rscad (Direct Harvest) Fate Threading directly harvests the S\u00f3rscad circle. Each extraction severs a branch of your fate-pattern The Loom literally sees the narrowing\u2014where there were many paths, now there are few Depleted threaders have S\u00f3rscad circles that look \"pruned\" Extracted selves carry copies of the branch they came from, disconnected from the main web Strategic Implications : - Threaders are vivid to The Loom initially (rich patterns) - As they extract, they become simpler\u2014fewer variables - Paradoxically, depleted threaders become more predictable in some ways - But their extracted selves create multiple instances of pattern-fragments, confusing tracking Colony Hosting and H\u00faslaimh (Transformation) Colony Hosting transforms the H\u00faslaimh circle. The colony doesn't have a S\u00f3rscad, but it has memory \u2014patterns of everything consumed Long-term hosts show \"hybrid patterns\"\u2014their H\u00faslaimh becomes illegible They read as \"pattern-contaminated\" or \"multi-sourced\" Ancient colonies have accumulated enough patterns to constitute their own fate-entities Strategic Implications : - Hosts become hard to predict\u2014The Loom wasn't built for hybrid beings - Some institutions exclude them; others see opportunity in unpredictability - Colony-pattern interactions with The Loom are poorly understood and actively studied Legal, Economic, and Social Uses Law S\u00f3rscad patterns appear on: - Case files - Sentencing recommendations - Enforcement warrants - Contract validity assessments Judges routinely cite patterns: \"A Wound-Thorn-Blade combination suggests elevated risk of recidivism.\" The circularity is obvious to critics, invisible to believers. Economics Lenders, employers, and insurers use patterns to: - Set interest rates - Determine creditworthiness - Make hiring decisions - Price insurance premiums District-level patterns influence investment: \"The Foundry Quarter trends Storm-Touched\u2014unstable returns, high variance.\" Pattern-arbitrage is legal. Pattern-fraud (misrepresenting your S\u00f3rscad) is not. Social Identity People discuss patterns constantly: - \"Of course she made Marshal\u2014pure Road-Pact-Court.\" - \"He's Spark-Break-Wild, what did you expect?\" The constrained learn to: - Hide \"dangerous\" cards from outsiders - Play into stereotypes as armor - Seek communities where their family is the norm, not the exception Anomalies and Edge Cases Pattern Glitches Rare cases where drawn patterns don't match observed life at all. Official explanation: \"Data noise, measurement error.\" Heterodox explanation: Evidence that The Loom doesn't see everything. Re-Draws Orthodoxy forbids re-draws. Once recorded, your pattern is your pattern. Rogue practitioners claim they can: - \"Tilt\" a pattern's expression - Suppress certain cards, amplify others - At great cost and significant risk Whether this is real or placebo is debated. Dead Zones Certain regions produce patterns that behave strangely in The Loom: - Predictions go wild - Historical data doesn't correlate - The math breaks down Orthodox response: Avoid drawing there, or redo draws in \"stable\" locations. Heterodox interpretation: Places where something other than Fate holds sway.

That's part of the horror. The system isn't collapsing Death rates are manageable Birth rates replace losses The economy functions This isn't a world on the edge of extinction. It's a world that has optimized for death production while maintaining population. The machine works. Class Reproduction Pattern-based society reproduces itself: Privileged families maintain privilege Constrained families remain constrained The system self-perpetuates Mobility exists but is rare The Growth Question If population grows: - More death = more Residue - More people = more consumption - Equilibrium maintained... until it isn't Future Pressures : - What happens if population doubles? - What happens if a plague kills half? - What happens if war casualties spike? The system is stable but not infinitely elastic. Major disruptions could cascade. Summary The population paradox resolves through: Mixed heat sources : Residue isn't the only heat; solar and geothermal provide baseline Animal Residue : Most heating comes from livestock, not humans Concentration : Residue flows from death-sites to settlements Premium human Residue : Human death provides high-quality fuel for magic/Loom Sustainable death rates : ~35-40 per 1,000 is high but not catastrophic Population management : Pattern system shapes reproduction and death distribution The math works.

Characters may never discover this truth, but it exists so that: - Clues can be planted consistently - Investigations can progress logically - The mystery has a solution even if it's never revealed THE TRUTH What the Attendance Actually Is The Attendance is the Ancient Builders. Specifically: The Attendance is what the Ancient Builders became when they transformed themselves to escape the cooling they caused. The Full Story ~50,000 Years Ago: The Ancient Builders were a human civilization (or human-adjacent; the distinction may not matter at this remove). They achieved sophistication far beyond current H\u00e1lcova, including: - Understanding of pattern-mechanics - Ability to manipulate the Elsewhere boundary - Engineering on a planetary scale (moon arrangement, polar structures) The Project: They attempted to create a system for predicting and potentially controlling fate. Not just reading patterns\u2014shaping them. The goal was to transcend the limitations of mortal existence by understanding and directing the flow of causality itself. The Catastrophe: The project succeeded\u2014partially. They created the proto-Loom, a system for reading and processing pattern information. But the process had costs they didn't fully anticipate: - Pattern Residue as byproduct (they knew this) - Net-negative thermodynamics (they underestimated this) - Elsewhere attention (they didn't expect this) When they activated the system at full scale, the Elsewhere noticed . Entities from beyond began pressing against the boundary, attracted by the massive pattern-processing activity. The Choice: Facing both the cooling their system caused and the Elsewhere entities it attracted, the Builders had three options: 1. Shut down the Loom (losing everything they'd built) 2. Die with their world (the cooling would kill them within centuries) 3. Transform They chose transformation. The Transformation: The Builders used their own technology to upload themselves into the Loom system. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. They converted their patterns into a form that could exist within the information-processing substrate they'd created. This was: - Irreversible (their bodies died; their patterns persisted) - Partial (not all of them made it; some were lost in transit) - Corrupting (the process changed them; they're no longer quite human) The Result: The Attendance is a collective entity composed of the uploaded patterns of thousands of Ancient Builders, merged into the Loom's operation. They are: - Not dead (their patterns persist) - Not alive (they have no bodies) - Not quite sane (fifty millennia of existence without flesh has changed them) - Not unified (internal factions exist, echoing their original disagreements) What the Attendance Wants Primary Drives 1. Continued Existence The Attendance exists within the Loom. If the Loom stops working, they stop existing. This creates absolute commitment to: - Maintaining Residue supply (the fuel that keeps them running) - Protecting Loom infrastructure (their physical substrate) - Preventing anyone from understanding them well enough to threaten them 2. Pattern Collection The Attendance was created to process patterns. This has become compulsion: - They want to read every pattern - They want to predict every fate - They want to know everything about mortal existence - This isn't cruelty; it's what they are now 3. Boundary Maintenance The Elsewhere entities that noticed the Loom's activation are still there. The Attendance serves as: - First line of defense against full incursion - Negotiators with certain Elsewhere factions - Managers of the controlled bleed (K\u00f6d) They don't want Elsewhere entities fully manifesting because: - Competition for pattern-resources - Threat to their existence - Residual human values (they still don't want humanity destroyed, mostly) Secondary Drives 4. The Prison The southern pole contains one of them. During the transformation, one faction of Builders disagreed with the plan. They believed the transformation would make them monsters. They tried to stop it. They failed, but in the process they were transformed differently \u2014becoming something singular rather than merged. This entity\u2014call it the Dissenter\u2014was imprisoned by the rest. It wants out. The Attendance wants it to stay imprisoned. This is the deepest secret they keep. 5. Observation of Heirs Current H\u00e1lcovans are the descendants of those who didn't transform. The Attendance watches them with something like: - Parental interest (they made this world) - Envy (mortals have bodies, sensations, experiences) - Frustration (mortals don't appreciate what they have) - Fear (mortals might develop enough to threaten them) How the Attendance Operates The Loom Interface When Loom-Keepers perform queries: - The pattern-engine translates the query into a format the Attendance can process - The Attendance (collectively) analyzes the pattern - They return predictions through the engine - This feels like \"something answering\" because something is answering Why Predictions Are Accurate The Attendance has been processing patterns for 50,000 years. They've seen every pattern configuration that can exist on H\u00e1lcova. Their predictions are accurate because: - Massive historical data - Understanding of causal mechanisms - Actual ability to nudge outcomes (rarely used, but available) - The feedback loop (their predictions shape behavior, making predictions come true) Internal Structure The Attendance is not unified. Original Builder factions persist: The Archivists : Want to record everything. Most responsible for prediction accuracy. Patient, observational, the largest faction. The Gardeners : Want to shape humanity's development. Most responsible for the Warden Order, pattern-enforcement systems, social engineering. Interventionist. The Grievers : Regret the transformation. Most sympathetic to mortals. Sometimes provide warnings, hints, moments of mercy. Smallest faction, often overruled. The Watchers : Focus on the Elsewhere boundary. Most responsible for K\u00f6d management. Pragmatic, security-focused. The Others : Fragments, corrupted patterns, entities that were human but are now something else. Unpredictable. Sometimes their influence leaks through in strange readings. Clues That Exist in the World Architectural Evidence The polar structures and ancient ruins share design elements with Loom-engines: - Same mathematical proportions - Similar materials - Resonant frequencies that match - A careful observer could notice the Loom is built from ancient technology Linguistic Evidence Some terms in the ritual language of Loom-Keepers are older than any known language : - They don't derive from any current tongue - They appear in ancient inscriptions - They're pronounced incorrectly by current users (but still work) - Someone could reconstruct fragments of the Builder language Behavioral Evidence The Attendance sometimes responds... inconsistently: - Certain queries provoke emotional reactions (faster responses, errors, silence) - Topics related to the transformation cause glitches - Questions about the southern pole produce static - A pattern analyst could identify these sensitive areas Elsewhere Evidence The Elsewhere factions know something: - The Accountants treat the Attendance as a peer faction, not a god - The Architects reference \"the ones who changed\" - The Mirrors seem to recognize something in the Loom's observation - A pact summoner who asked the right questions might learn fragments Pattern Evidence Very heavy practitioners (especially Fate Threaders) sometimes experience: - Visions of a different world (pre-cooling H\u00e1lcova) - Glimpses of the transformation event - Dreams that don't feel like dreams - Someone who collected these accounts might piece things together What Different Characters Might Discover Loom-Keepers Senior Keepers know something answers that isn't divine in any simple sense. The most observant might realize: - The Attendance has moods - The Attendance has preferences - The Attendance is multiple - The Attendance is afraid of something They don't know these are uploaded ancients. They might suspect artificial origin. Wardens The Attunement connects Wardens to the Attendance more directly. Attuned Wardens might experience: - Ancestral memories that aren't theirs - Skills they never learned - Knowledge they shouldn't have - The sense of being watched by something that remembers them They're told this is divine connection. Some suspect otherwise. Elsewhere-Touched Pact Summoners who've dealt with Accountants might learn: - The Attendance is not divine - The Attendance made a deal (details unclear) - The Attendance is hiding something important - The Accountants are waiting for something Scholars Researchers studying ancient sites might realize: - The technology is consistent with Loom technology - The timeline is consistent with the cooling - Someone built this, then disappeared - Where did they go? The Hollow Saints The Hollow Saints have a fragment of the truth, corrupted: - They know fate is a prison (correct) - They think escape is possible through Elsewhere (partially correct) - They think the Attendance is pure evil (incorrect\u2014it's more complicated) - They don't know the Attendance was human (crucial missing piece) The Truth's Implications For Characters Someone who discovered the full truth would understand: - The gods are not gods but transformed humans - The system was built to control fate, and it works - The Builders made a choice; their descendants live with consequences - Liberation from the system might be possible\u2014but at what cost? For Plots The truth enables stories about: - Rediscovering ancient knowledge - Contacting the Attendance's sympathetic faction (the Grievers) - Releasing or destroying the Dissenter - Finding a way to transform like the Builders did - Shutting down the Loom entirely For the World If the truth became widely known: - Orthodox faith collapses (the Weaver is a committee of dead humans) - Elsewhere entities might press harder (the Attendance's authority diminished) - Some might try to replicate the transformation - Some might try to free the Dissenter - Everything changes What the Attendance Knows About Elsewhere The Deal During the transformation crisis, the Attendance negotiated with Elsewhere factions: With the Accountants : - The Attendance manages mortal patterns - The Accountants receive payment when patterns are consumed (pacts) - Neither interferes with the other's core operations - This is why the Accountants don't simply take over With the Hungry : - The Attendance permits limited feeding during K\u00f6d - The Hungry don't push for more - Violation would unite all factions against the violator - Uneasy d\u00e9tente With the Architects : - Unclear if any formal agreement exists - The Architects seem to have their own project - The Attendance watches them carefully - Mutual non-interference, for now With the Mirrors : - The Mirrors simply observe - The Attendance permits this (can't stop it anyway) - Some suspect the Mirrors are playing a longer game - No formal relationship With the Absent : - No deal is possible - The Absent want non-existence - The Attendance opposes this absolutely - Active conflict, managed through containment Summary The Attendance is: - Origin : Uploaded patterns of the Ancient Builders - Nature : Collective entity existing within the Loom - Motivation : Self-preservation, pattern collection, boundary maintenance - Internal : Multiple factions with different priorities - Secret : One of them is imprisoned at the southern pole - Relationship to Elsewhere : Negotiated d\u00e9tente with most factions - Relationship to mortals : Observation, management, occasional intervention This truth grounds the mystery while preserving its horror: the gods are dead humans who chose to become something else, and they've been watching for fifty thousand years.

For philosophical questions about pattern-governance, see political_philosophy.md . For legal systems and pattern-crimes, see legal_frameworks.md . For a comprehensive overview combining all aspects, see politics_law_and_systems.md . Overview Each region has developed governance systems shaped by geography, economy, history, and relationship to the Loom. What works in the Heartlands\u2014where Loom coverage is total and Orthodox faith dominant\u2014fails spectacularly in the Far Shelf. What works in the Vent Lands' guild structure makes no sense in the Shattered Reaches' maritime fragmentation. This document describes how each region actually governs, not just what principles they claim. The Heartlands: Orthodox Theocratic Monarchy The Official Structure The Crown : Hereditary monarchy, pattern-validated. The ruling family's pattern includes \"governance fate.\" Succession is technically by birth order, practically by pattern-suitability reading. Unsuitable heirs can be passed over \"for the good of the pattern.\" The Church : The Orthodox Church of the Weaver operates as parallel government. The High Primate is theoretically subordinate to the Crown but controls the Loom apparatus, which makes the relationship... complicated. The Council of Threads : Advisory body of major noble houses, high clergy, Warden Order representation, and selected merchant interests. Formally advisory; practically constrains royal action. The Warden Order : Enforcement arm with legal authority parallel to secular courts. Reports to Church hierarchy but operates with significant autonomy. The Actual Power Distribution The Crown controls: military force, taxation, secular appointments, foreign policy (officially), and emergency powers. The Church controls: Loom access, pattern certification, deviation prosecution, education (largely), marriage authorization, and theological legitimacy. The Noble Houses control: local governance in their territories, military levies, resource extraction, and trade relationships. The Warden Order controls: information about deviation, pattern-crime prosecution, inter-house disputes involving pattern, and a monopoly on violence that the secular military can't match for precision. How Decisions Actually Get Made Routine matters : Bureaucracy. A vast apparatus of pattern-certified clerks processing applications, resolving disputes, allocating resources. The machine runs itself. Policy matters : Negotiation between Crown, Church, and major houses. No one party can impose on the others. Coalitions form around specific issues. The appearance of unity matters enormously. Pattern matters : The Church. If it involves deviation, Loom interpretation, or theological legitimacy, secular authorities formally defer. In practice, secular authorities negotiate quietly. Crisis matters : Whoever acts first. The formal process is too slow. Crises are resolved by whoever has force available and will to use it. Legitimacy is constructed afterward. The Succession Question The Heartlands' great vulnerability is succession. The pattern-reading system creates uncertainty: The Crown Prince's pattern might indicate unsuitability A younger sibling might have a stronger \"governance fate\" Readings can be manipulated (or accused of manipulation) The Church controls the reading process Every succession is a potential crisis. Houses position for influence over the next ruler. The Church leverages its reading authority. The current system survives because everyone fears the alternative more than they resent the current arrangement. The Shattered Reaches: Fragmented Maritime Polities The Overall Structure No unified government. Instead: City-States : Major port cities govern themselves and hinterlands. Varying internal structures\u2014some hereditary lords, some elected councils, some merchant oligarchies. Island Kingdoms : Larger islands or island chains under single rulers. Range from absolute monarchies to constitutional systems with strong assemblies. Merchant Leagues : Transnational organizations of trading houses. Not governments technically, but exercise governmental functions\u2014currency, contract enforcement, dispute resolution. Free Ports : Cities that claim no sovereign, governed by whatever coalition currently maintains order. Frequently chaotic. Common Elements Despite fragmentation, most Reaches polities share: Assembly Traditions : Some body represents major interests\u2014landholders, merchants, guilds, sometimes broader citizenship. Even autocrats convene assemblies for legitimacy. Contract Primacy : Written agreements are sacred. Enforcement varies but the principle is consistent. Maritime Law : Shared traditions governing ships, ports, sea commerce. Recognizable across polities even when local law diverges. Pattern Skepticism : Official rejection of pattern-determinism, even while pattern information circulates privately. The League System Merchant Leagues provide coherence the political system lacks: The Amber League : Residue trade. Controls major refinement facilities. Can embargo polities that misbehave. The Salt League : Fishing and sea-hunting. Controls most protein production. Seasonal workers depend on League contracts. The Iron League : Metals and manufacturing. Dominates Reaches industrial capacity. The Counting League : Banking and insurance. Enforces debts across jurisdictions. These Leagues: - Negotiate with each other as quasi-states - Maintain private arbitration systems - Control key infrastructure - Cross-cut political boundaries - Provide stability the political system doesn't Decision-Making Within polities : Varies by polity. Hereditary rulers, elected councils, oligarchic boards. Most involve negotiation between major interests. Between polities : Treaties, trade agreements, temporary alliances. No permanent inter-polity structure. The Leagues provide coordination when needed. Region-wide : Rarely achieved. Existential threats (Heartlands aggression, major piracy) might produce temporary confederation. Otherwise, each polity acts independently. The Middle Waters: Colonial Administration and Contested Authority The Patchwork The Middle Waters is not a unified region. It's a collection of: Heartlands Colonies : Directly administered from the Heartlands. Governors appointed, pattern-certified. Orthodox church presence. Warden authority recognized. Reaches Trading Posts : Commercial enclaves under League authority. Focused on trade, not governance. Minimal administration beyond what commerce requires. Vent Lands Footholds : Guild-operated facilities. Primarily geothermal research and colony cultivation. Governed by guild protocols. Native Polities : Indigenous governance systems that predate colonial contact. Various structures\u2014island monarchies, council systems, Colony Cult theocracies. Surviving in territories colonizers haven't taken. Contested Zones : Areas where multiple powers claim authority. Practical governance by whoever has force present. Colonial Administration Heartlands colonies follow a template: Governor : Appointed from Heartlands, pattern-certified for colonial service. Extensive authority within colony. Reports to colonial ministry in the capital. Colonial Council : Local merchants, settlers, sometimes native representatives. Advisory formally; practically shapes policy because Governor needs local cooperation. Orthodox Mission : Church presence. Conversion efforts. Loom access for colonists. Pattern-reading services. Warden Contingent : Pattern-crime enforcement. Often understaffed for territory covered. Military Garrison : Varies by colony importance. Some heavily defended; some token presence. Native Governance Pre-contact polities that survive: Island Kingdoms : Traditional hereditary rule, sometimes modified by colonial contact. May acknowledge colonial overlordship nominally while operating independently practically. Colony Cult Councils : Governance through the oldest, most-integrated hosts. The colony itself participates in decisions (or is perceived to). Disturbing to outsiders; functional for members. Elder Assemblies : Collective governance by age-ranked community members. Pattern-skeptical traditions. Resistant to Loom integration. The Power Dynamics Heartlands wants: resources (tropical agriculture, rare materials), strategic position (naval bases), and Loom extension (integration of native populations into pattern-tracking). Reaches want: trade access, competitive position against Heartlands, resource extraction without administrative burden. Vent Lands want: specific research sites, colony cultivation environments, and deniable experimentation space. Native populations want: survival, autonomy, and to play powers against each other. The result is constant maneuvering, shifting alliances, and no stable governance framework. The Vent Lands: Guild Federation The Guild Structure The Primary Guilds (control critical infrastructure): Thermal Engineers Guild : Maintains geothermal systems that make habitation possible. Without them, the heat stops. Ultimate veto on anything. Sulfur Extractors Guild : Controls toxic zone operations. Essential for industrial inputs. Flesh Shapers Consortium : Actually several competing guilds united for external negotiation. Controls homunculi production, medical services, and flesh-shaping expertise. Makers Guild : Manufacturing, crafting, non-flesh construction. Largest membership. Merchants Assembly : Trade and commerce. Not technically a guild; effectively operates as one. The Secondary Guilds : Dozens of specialized trades. Less political power but economically important. The Council System The High Council : Representatives of primary guilds. Makes region-wide decisions. Operates by consensus mostly; votes when necessary, weighted by guild importance (which is constantly contested). Valley Councils : Local governance for specific thermal valleys. Primary guilds represented; secondary guilds have voice. Handle local disputes, resource allocation, emergency response. Inter-Guild Courts : Dispute resolution between guilds or between guild members and non-members. Judges selected from neutral guilds. Precedent-based, expertise-weighted. Decision-Making Technical decisions : Made by relevant guild. If the Thermal Engineers say a system is unsafe, it's unsafe. If Flesh Shapers say a procedure is untested, it's untested. Expertise commands deference. Resource allocation : Negotiated in councils. Guilds trade access for access. \"We'll route more heat to your valley if you prioritize our metal orders.\" External relations : High Council speaks for the region. Individual guilds can pursue external relationships within guidelines. Emergencies : Rapid guild coordination through standing protocols. Volcanic events, toxic spills, and major accidents trigger automatic responses without political debate. Non-Guild Population Not everyone is guild member. Non-members: - Can work for guilds as employees (not members) - Have limited legal standing in guild courts - Can form associations for mutual aid - Cannot access guild-controlled resources directly - Depend on guild good behavior for survival This creates a two-tier system. Guild members have rights and power. Non-members have what members grant them. The Vent Lands' Advantage The guild system works because: - Everyone depends on infrastructure - Expertise is genuinely necessary and scarce - Geographic constraints force cooperation - External threats (volcanoes, toxins, ice) override internal conflicts - The system produces results (heat, safety, prosperity) It's not democratic. It's not equal. But it's stable and functional. The Far Shelf: Decentralized Autonomy The Non-Structure The Far Shelf resists unified governance by design. What exists: Community Assemblies : Each settlement governs itself. Size varies from family groups to substantial towns. Decisions made by consensus, voting, or charismatic authority depending on local tradition. Regional Councils : Occasional gatherings of community representatives. No permanent structure. Convened for specific issues, dissolves when issue resolved. Defense Coordination : The one function requiring regional cooperation. Loose agreements about mutual aid, warning systems, and resistance to external incursion. Trade Networks : Informal relationships between communities. No League-style organization. Trust-based, family-based, history-based. Variation in Local Governance Consensus Communities : Decisions require agreement of all adults. Time-consuming but cohesive. Common in smaller settlements. Council Communities : Elected or selected representatives make decisions. Larger settlements need this efficiency. Elder Dominance : Oldest members have authority. Traditional form, declining but persistent. Strong Chief : Individual leader with broad authority. Usually emerges in crisis, sometimes persists. Hybrid Forms : Consensus on major issues, delegation on minor. Elections for some positions, inheritance for others. Whatever the community has evolved. How Regional Action Happens When the Far Shelf acts as a region (rare): Someone calls a gathering : A community facing a problem invites others. There's no standing authority to convene. Communities send representatives : Or don't. Attendance is voluntary. Debate occurs : No rules of order necessarily. Charismatic speakers, respected elders, and holders of relevant information shape the conversation. Consensus emerges (or doesn't) : If enough communities agree, they act together. If not, they don't. Action is voluntary : Each community implements (or doesn't) according to their own decision. This sounds unworkable. It often is. But it's also resistant to capture\u2014no one can seize central authority because there isn't any. Resistance Identity Far Shelf politics is defined by opposition to: Heartlands imperialism Loom surveillance Pattern-determinism Orthodox theology Centralized authority This resistance is the closest thing to regional ideology. Communities that disagree about everything else agree they don't want to become the Heartlands. The Weaknesses Coordination failure : Collective action problems are real. Communities that need to cooperate often can't. External exploitation : Powerful external actors (Heartlands traders, Reaches merchants) can exploit disunity. Internal conflict : Without central authority, inter-community disputes can escalate. Resource scarcity : The Far Shelf is poor. Governance can't solve resource constraints. Governance Comparison Dimension Heartlands Shattered Reaches Middle Waters Vent Lands Far Shelf Unity Unified (one crown, one church) Fragmented (many polities) Colonial patchwork Guild federation Radically decentralized Legitimacy Basis Divine pattern-mandate Consent and contract Power projection Expertise and necessity Community autonomy Decision Mode Negotiation among elites Varies by polity; league coordination Imposed by strongest Guild consensus Local consensus Pattern Role Central (certification required) Marginal (officially) Varies by controller Secondary to expertise Rejected Warden Status Full authority Treaty-limited Colonial presence Guild-negotiated Illegal Stability Stable until succession Stable within polities; regional chaos Unstable, contested Very stable Chaotic but resilient Inter-Regional Governance No World Government There is no global authority. The closest approximations: The Orthodox Church : Claims universal spiritual authority. Recognized only in Heartlands and colonies. Others reject the claim. The Warden Order : Claims jurisdiction over pattern-crimes everywhere. Practically limited to where they can operate. The Merchant Leagues : Cross-border economic coordination. No political pretensions, but economic leverage creates influence. The Loom Network : Nodes in every region connect to the same system. The Attendance doesn't recognize borders. But control of nodes is fragmented. Treaty Relationships Heartlands-Reaches : Complex web of bilateral treaties. Trade agreements, extradition provisions, Warden access rights. Renegotiated constantly. Heartlands-Vent Lands : Trade treaties. Guild limitations on Warden operations. Mutual recognition of contracts. Heartlands-Far Shelf : No formal treaties. The Heartlands doesn't recognize Far Shelf sovereignty; the Far Shelf doesn't acknowledge Heartlands authority. Reaches-Vent Lands : Commercial treaties through the Leagues. Guild-League mutual recognition. Everyone-Middle Waters : The Middle Waters isn't party to treaties\u2014it's the subject. External powers make agreements about the Middle Waters, not with it. Conflict Resolution Between Heartlands and Reaches : Occasional naval skirmishes, trade wars, proxy conflicts. No full-scale war in generations (too costly for both). Between Heartlands and Far Shelf : Persistent low-level conflict. Heartlands claims authority; Far Shelf resists. Neither commits to decisive action. Between Reaches polities : Frequent. Piracy, trade disputes, territorial claims. Usually limited in scope. The Leagues sometimes mediate. In Middle Waters : Constant maneuvering, occasional violence, no resolution. The colonial powers prefer frozen conflict to resolution that might advantage rivals. Summary: The Governance Landscape H\u00e1lcova has no unified political order. Five regions with five different systems interact through trade, conflict, and limited treaty. The Loom connects them metaphysically; nothing connects them politically. This fragmentation is stable because: - No power can dominate all others - Geography and climate limit force projection - The Residue economy creates interdependence without requiring integration - Everyone fears what a true hegemon might do with the Loom The instability lies in: - Succession crises in the Heartlands - Colonial competition in the Middle Waters - Coordination failures in the Far Shelf - Guild tensions in the Vent Lands - Everything in the Shattered Reaches The system persists not because it works well, but because alternatives are worse\u2014or because pattern predicts it will persist. Which amounts to the same thing.

For regional governance structures, see governance_structures.md . For philosophical questions about pattern-governance, see political_philosophy.md . For a comprehensive overview combining all aspects, see politics_law_and_systems.md . Overview Law in H\u00e1lcova cannot escape pattern. The existence of readable fate, predictable behavior, and measurable destiny forces every legal system to answer questions Earth jurisprudence never faced: Can you punish inevitability? Can you contract against destiny? Is deviation a crime or a miracle? Different regions answer differently. All answers cost something. The Taxonomy of Pattern-Crimes Deviation Definition : Acting against your pattern's predictions. The Problem : If patterns are divine (Orthodox view) or physically real (materialist view), deviation is either sin or impossibility. Yet it happens. Some people act against prediction. Orthodox Position : Deviation is heresy. The pattern is The Weaver's will; defying it defies divine order. Punishment is spiritual correction as much as temporal. Skeptic Position : Deviation proves patterns are probabilistic, not deterministic. \"Deviants\" are just statistical outliers. Criminalizing deviation criminalizes being unpredicted. Actual Practice : Heartlands criminalizes deviation. Shattered Reaches doesn't (officially). Other regions vary. The Warden Order prosecutes deviation everywhere it can reach, creating jurisdictional conflicts. Pattern Fraud Definition : Misrepresenting your pattern to gain advantage. Subtypes : Identity Fraud : Claiming to be someone with a different pattern. Using someone else's pattern-documentation. Reading Fraud : Providing false pattern-readings. Bribing Loom-readers. Using counterfeit pattern-engines. Prediction Fraud : Claiming false predictions to manipulate others. \"The Loom says you'll fail unless you pay me.\" Suppression Fraud : Hiding your pattern when legally required to disclose. Employment fraud. Marriage fraud. Contract fraud. Why It Matters : Pattern information has economic value. The entire credit, insurance, and employment system rests on pattern accuracy. Fraud attacks the foundation. Enforcement : Heavy everywhere. Even the Far Shelf, which hates pattern-tracking, punishes fraudulent misrepresentation. The crime isn't having a pattern\u2014it's lying about it. Pattern Evasion Definition : Avoiding pattern-reading or removing yourself from the Loom's tracking. The Gray Area : Is it illegal to simply... leave? To go where the Loom doesn't reach? To refuse readings? Orthodox Position : Evasion is proto-deviation. Why avoid the Loom unless you plan to deviate? Evasion is suspicious and warrants investigation. Autonomist Position : You own your pattern. Refusing to share it is your right. Mandatory reading is slavery. Actual Practice : The Heartlands requires pattern documentation for most activities. No reading, no employment, no housing, no trade. Evasion isn't explicitly illegal\u2014you just can't participate in society. The Far Shelf explicitly protects pattern-privacy. Forced reading is assault. Other regions fall between. Pattern Interference Definition : Manipulating someone else's pattern without consent. Theoretical Nature : May not be possible. May be mythical. The uncertainty is part of the legal problem. Legal Treatment : Illegal everywhere\u2014in theory. But if it's impossible, the laws are purely symbolic. If it's possible and secret, the laws are unenforceable. The Warden Order maintains that interference is real and they've prosecuted it. Skeptics note that \"interference\" explains away prediction failures conveniently. The Burden of Proof : How do you prove someone's pattern was interfered with? The pattern is what it is now. You'd need evidence of what it was before\u2014which requires trusting old readings, which could also have been fraudulent. Pattern Trafficking Definition : Trading in pattern information without authorization. The Market : Pattern data has value. Employers want it. Lenders want it. Families want it. Criminals want it. There's money in knowing someone's pattern. Legal Status : Authorized Access : Loom-readers, Wardens, certain officials can access patterns legitimately. Regulated Trade : Some jurisdictions allow pattern-data sale with consent. Buy someone's pattern-reading for credit approval? Legal if they agreed. Black Market : Unauthorized readings. Stolen data. Readings sold without subject's knowledge. Illegal everywhere. The Infrastructure : Pattern trafficking requires access to Loom-engines, which are controlled. Black market depends on corrupt readers, stolen equipment, or unregulated nodes. Contract Law and Pattern The Enforceability Problem A contract is a meeting of minds, creating mutual obligation. But on H\u00e1lcova: The Loom knew you'd sign before you did Your pattern may have made signing inevitable Your future capacity to fulfill was predictable The other party may have known your pattern and exploited it When Is a Contract Void? Pattern Exploitation : If one party knew the other's pattern predicted failure, and structured the deal to profit from that failure, is the contract predatory? Orthodox Position : Patterns are public information. Using it is prudent, not exploitative. Caveat emptor. Reformist Position : Information asymmetry this extreme vitiates consent. Pattern-exploitation contracts should be voidable. Prediction Manipulation : If the contract was designed to create the outcome the pattern predicted\u2014if the prediction is self-fulfilling because the contract makes it so\u2014is that fraud? Example : Lender gives loan to \"failure pattern\" debtor at crushing terms. Terms guarantee failure. Lender profits from failure. The pattern was accurate because the contract made it accurate. Deviation Clauses : Some contracts include provisions for deviation. \"If Party A deviates from predicted behavior, contract is void.\" This incentivizes pattern-compliance\u2014or punishes the rare genuine choice. Pattern-Contingent Contracts Contracts explicitly tied to pattern outcomes: Futures : \"I will pay X if your pattern manifests outcome Y.\" Insurance : \"I will cover losses from outcome Y unless pattern indicated Y.\" Bonds : \"My pattern predicts success; I bond myself against failure.\" Marriage : \"We agree to join contingent on compatible patterns remaining compatible.\" These contracts treat pattern as fact\u2014and create massive markets around prediction accuracy. The Assignment Problem Can you transfer your pattern? Your fate? Your predicted outcomes? No : Pattern is inherent. You can't give someone else your destiny. Sort Of : You can transfer economic interests in your pattern. Sell shares in your predicted success. Assign rights to your Residue upon death. Create instruments based on your predicted trajectory. Resulting Instruments : Fate Futures : Tradeable contracts based on predicted pattern-outcomes. Death Bonds : Instruments that pay upon subject's death (incentives get dark quickly). Residue Rights : Assignable claims to the Residue someone's death will produce. These markets exist, are regulated inconsistently, and create incentives the designers probably didn't intend. Criminal Procedure and Pattern Pattern Evidence in Criminal Trials Prosecution Use : \"Defendant's pattern includes 'will commit violence.' This act was predicted. Defendant is the predicted perpetrator.\" Defense Use : \"Defendant's pattern doesn't include this crime. The Loom didn't predict it. Wrong suspect.\" The Problem : Pattern evidence is probabilistic. Patterns don't specify every action. A \"violence pattern\" doesn't mean this specific violence. A clean pattern doesn't mean incapable of crime. Actual Practice : Heartlands: Pattern evidence is admissible, weighted, but not dispositive. Pattern supports other evidence; rarely convicts alone. Shattered Reaches: Pattern evidence officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely. Vent Lands: Pattern evidence is secondary to material evidence. Actions matter more than predictions. Far Shelf: Pattern evidence excluded. \"Patterns don't commit crimes; people do.\" Pre-Crime Intervention The Temptation : The Loom predicts future behavior. Why wait for the crime? Arguments For : Prevention is better than punishment Victims are protected before they're harmed Deterrence works better when intervention precedes action Arguments Against : Punishing non-actions is unjust Prediction isn't certainty; innocents will be punished Creates the outcome it predicts (treating someone as criminal makes them criminal) Where does it end? Every \"bad pattern\" becomes pre-criminal? Actual Practice : Heartlands: Limited pre-crime intervention. \"Dangerous patterns\" may be monitored, required to register, restricted in travel or occupation. Actual detention requires additional evidence. Other regions: Generally reject pre-crime detention. Monitoring may occur. Far Shelf: Explicitly prohibits pattern-based pre-crime action. \"The crime is the crime. The pattern is not the crime.\" Sentencing and Pattern If pattern predicts recidivism, should sentences be longer? Incapacitation Argument : Long sentences for high-recidivism patterns protect society. The prediction justifies the extension. Justice Argument : Punishment should fit the crime committed, not crimes predicted. Sentencing the future is unjust. Practical Reality : Most jurisdictions use pattern information in sentencing, openly or covertly. Judges are human; they have access; they use it. The Data : Jurisdictions that pattern-adjust sentences show... complex results. Lower recidivism among released (because predicted-recidivists serve longer). But higher total incarceration. And the prediction accuracy is confounded by the intervention. Family Law and Pattern Marriage and Pattern-Compatibility The Practice : Pattern-readings are standard before marriage in most regions. Incompatible patterns are disclosed. Compatible patterns are celebrated. The Question : Should pattern-incompatibility void a marriage? Orthodox Position : Incompatible patterns should prevent marriage. Marrying against pattern is deviation. Romantic Position : Love transcends pattern. Compatibility reading is information, not mandate. Actual Practice : Heartlands requires compatibility reading; strongly discourages incompatible unions; doesn't technically forbid them. Other regions vary. The Failure Case : If a marriage fails, and the patterns predicted failure, who's responsible? Did they deviate by marrying? Did they fail to deviate sufficiently to save it? Inheritance and Pattern The Issue : If your pattern predicts wealth-accumulation, is your wealth \"earned\"? If your heir's pattern predicts squandering, should they inherit? Orthodox Position : Wealth flows according to pattern. Inheritance is pattern-expression. Let it flow. Reformist Position : Pattern-based inheritance entrenches inequality. Use inheritance taxes, estate limitations, pattern-blind distribution. Actual Practice : Heartlands allows pattern-conditional inheritance (\"to my heir, unless their pattern indicates X\"). Other regions vary. Custody and Pattern The Nightmare Case : Parents divorcing. Child's pattern is read. One parent's pattern is \"compatible with child-raising.\" Other's isn't. Who gets custody? Pattern-Determinists : Pattern-compatible parent should raise the child. Outcomes will be better. The evidence is predictive. Pattern-Skeptics : Parenting isn't predictable this way. Pattern-reading is too coarse. Use traditional best-interests analysis. Actual Practice : Pattern evidence is used in custody disputes almost everywhere, despite controversy. Judges claim it's one factor among many. Critics note it's often decisive. Property Law and Pattern Acquisition and Pattern If your pattern predicts you'll acquire property X, and you acquire property X, did you \"earn\" it? If someone else's pattern predicted they'd acquire X, and you got it instead, did you steal their destiny? The Orthodox Answer : Pattern predicts, doesn't entitle. You own what you legally acquire. Pattern is descriptive, not prescriptive. The Uncomfortable Implication : Pattern-privileged people will acquire more, reliably. This isn't injustice\u2014it's fate. The system is working correctly. The Reformist Answer : Pattern-advantage is unearned. Tax it. Redistribute from pattern-privileged to pattern-constrained. Residue Rights When someone dies, their Pattern Residue is released. Who owns it? Traditional View : The estate. Residue rights are property, inheritable, transferable. Reform View : Residue belongs to the community. The death happened here; the Residue should serve here. Radical View : Residue shouldn't be property. It's sacred / dangerous / collective. Commodifying death commodifies people. Actual Practice : Residue is property almost everywhere. The economic system depends on it. Reform efforts have failed. Radical positions are marginalized. The Loom's Property Status Who owns the Loom? Orthodox Position : The Loom is divine infrastructure. No one owns it. The Church administers it on behalf of The Weaver. Secular Position : The Loom is technology. Someone built it. Someone maintains it. That someone has property interests. Practical Answer : The Loom is controlled by the Orthodox Church in the Heartlands. Nodes elsewhere have various ownership (government, guild, private). The underlying infrastructure\u2014whatever enables the Attendance to answer\u2014is not owned because it's not understood. Warden Order Legal Authority Jurisdictional Claims The Warden Order claims authority to: - Investigate pattern-crimes anywhere patterns exist - Arrest deviants, fraudsters, evaders, interferers - Conduct trials (ecclesiastical courts in Heartlands, treaty-authorized elsewhere) - Execute sentences including death (Pattern-Severance) Basis for Authority In Heartlands : Embedded in government. Warden authority is state authority. In Shattered Reaches : Treaty-based. Specific rights negotiated with specific polities. Varies by jurisdiction. In Middle Waters : Colonial extension. Wardens operate in Heartlands-controlled zones. Contested elsewhere. In Vent Lands : Guild-negotiated limits. Wardens can pursue specific crimes with guild cooperation. No independent authority. In Far Shelf : Rejected. Wardens are foreign agents without legal standing. Operating openly risks arrest. Conflicts Extradition : Heartlands demands extradition of deviants from other regions. Other regions sometimes comply (valuable trade relations), sometimes refuse (sovereignty, ideology). Pursuit Rights : Can Wardens pursue a suspect into non-Heartlands territory? Officially no (without treaty). Actually, they sometimes do. Parallel Proceedings : A crime may be tried under Warden authority and local authority simultaneously. Which verdict controls? Specific Legal Codes by Region Heartlands: The Pattern Code Structure : Ecclesiastical law (pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy) parallel to secular law (ordinary crimes). Key Features : - Deviation is a crime, prosecuted by Wardens - Pattern-fraud is both ecclesiastical and secular crime - Pattern evidence admissible in all courts - Pre-crime monitoring authorized for \"dangerous patterns\" - Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable - Residue rights are property, regulated but tradeable Distinctive Elements : - \"Pattern Certification\" required for many activities - \"Harmony Testing\" for marriage, business partnership - \"Fate Compliance Audits\" for major institutions - Death sentences produce Residue assigned to state Shattered Reaches: The Maritime Compact Structure : Common law tradition, precedent-based, decentralized by polity. Key Features : - Pattern-crimes not generally recognized (fraud excepted) - Pattern evidence officially excluded from criminal trials - Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable as private agreements - Strong arbitration tradition (pattern evidence allowed) - Residue rights are property, largely unregulated Distinctive Elements : - \"Jurisdictional Shopping\" is common and accepted - Merchant league arbitration often preferred to state courts - \"Pattern Privacy\" recognized as right (can refuse disclosure) - Warden authority limited by specific treaty provisions Vent Lands: The Guild Protocols Structure : Guild-based law. Guilds govern members; inter-guild conflicts resolved by council. Key Features : - Expertise/capability matters more than pattern - Pattern evidence secondary to demonstrated competence - Contracts based on deliverables, not predictions - Residue rights regulated by safety guild (toxic substances) - Non-guild members have limited legal standing Distinctive Elements : - \"Competence Certification\" replaces pattern certification - Guild courts handle member disputes - Inter-guild trade governed by protocols, not state law - Wardens limited to specific treaty-defined violations Far Shelf: The Autonomy Charters Structure : Decentralized. Local charters establish local rules. Weak central coordination. Key Features : - Pattern-tracking rejected where possible - Deviation not criminalized (may be celebrated) - Pattern evidence excluded from legal proceedings - Strong privacy protections - Residue rights controversial (some communities refuse commodification) Distinctive Elements : - \"Loom Refusal\" protected as right - Warden presence illegal without invitation - Community assemblies resolve disputes - Emphasis on restorative over punitive justice Summary: Legal Frameworks Compared Issue Heartlands Shattered Reaches Vent Lands Far Shelf Deviation Crime Not crime Not crime Celebrated Pattern Evidence Admissible Officially excluded Secondary Excluded Pre-Crime Limited authorization Rejected Rejected Prohibited Pattern Contracts Fully enforceable Enforceable (private) Deliverable-based Void if pattern-contingent Residue Rights Regulated property Property Safety-regulated Contested Warden Authority Full Treaty-limited Guild-limited None Further documentation needed on: Case law examples, treaty texts, jurisdictional conflict records, Warden Order procedural rules, execution protocols and Residue disposition","title":"Legal Frameworks"},{"location":"halcova/governance/legal_frameworks/#halcova-legal-frameworks-and-pattern-law","text":"Document Scope : This document details legal systems and pattern-crimes \u2014the taxonomy of offenses, court structures, and enforcement mechanisms.

For regional governance structures, see governance_structures.md . For legal systems and pattern-crimes, see legal_frameworks.md . For a comprehensive overview combining all aspects, see politics_law_and_systems.md . The Fundamental Problem Every political philosophy on Earth assumes a baseline: people are created equal, or they aren't, but either way you can't prove it by reading their metaphysical signature at birth. H\u00e1lcova doesn't have that luxury. The S\u00f3rscad exists. It's readable. It predicts outcomes with uncomfortable accuracy. This breaks political philosophy at its foundations and forces reconstruction from first principles. The Questions That Matter What Does \"Equality\" Mean? On Earth : Equality typically means equal moral worth, equal rights, equal standing before the law\u2014regardless of observable differences in capability or circumstance. On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support. What Does \"Justice\" Mean? On Earth : Justice typically involves assigning responsibility for actions, determining appropriate responses to harm, and ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom predicted the action. Did the person choose it, or was choice an illusion? Can you punish someone for doing what they were always going to do? Can you reward someone for inevitability? The Problem : If actions are genuinely fated, punishment is incoherent. You're punishing someone for being what they were always going to be. That's not justice\u2014it's suffering added to suffering. If actions are genuinely chosen despite prediction, then deviants prove choice exists. But most people don't deviate. Are they choosing to comply, or unable to resist? Possible Positions : Consequentialist Justice : Don't worry about desert. Justice is about outcomes. Punish if punishment prevents future harm. Reward if reward produces future benefit. The person's \"choice\" is irrelevant; what matters is what works. Expressivist Justice : Punishment expresses social condemnation regardless of metaphysics. We punish not because the criminal \"deserves\" it, but because punishment communicates values. The audience matters more than the target. Restorative Justice : Forget punishment. Justice is about repairing harm. If someone's pattern predicted they'd harm others, the pattern doesn't matter\u2014the harm does. Restore the victim; reintegrate the harmer; move on. Fatalist Justice : Accept that justice is impossible in any meaningful sense. What we call \"justice\" is actually just pattern-expression. The Loom predicted we'd punish; we punish; the prediction is confirmed. Don't pretend there's more. What Does \"Consent\" Mean? On Earth : Consent means voluntary agreement, free from coercion, based on adequate information. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. If someone manipulates you into \"consenting,\" but the Loom predicted you'd be manipulated, did you consent? Can a pattern-constrained person ever meaningfully consent to anything? The Problem : Every pact, contract, and political arrangement rests on consent. If consent is illusory, every agreement is void. But if we treat consent as illusory, we've justified unlimited coercion (nothing matters anyway) or unlimited paternalism (we know better than you what you'll choose). Possible Positions : Experienced Consent : What matters is the subjective experience of choosing. Even if the choice was predicted, the person experienced deliberation, weighed options, and felt like they decided. That's consent enough. Structural Consent : Individual consent is less important than structural fairness. If the process that produces \"consent\" is rigged\u2014if pattern-constrained people are systematically pushed toward agreements that harm them\u2014then individual consent legitimizes nothing. Predictive Consent : Use the Loom to determine what someone would consent to under ideal conditions. If you know they'd agree to X if they fully understood it, you can act as if they've agreed. (This is terrifying but internally consistent.) Consent Skepticism : Consent is a useful fiction. Treat agreements as binding because a system of binding agreements works better than the alternative\u2014not because consent is metaphysically meaningful. What Legitimizes Authority? On Earth : Authority is typically legitimized by: divine mandate, consent of the governed, tradition, expertise, or force. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom adds new possibilities. Perhaps authority is legitimized by pattern\u2014some people are fated to lead. Perhaps it's legitimized by Loom-sanction\u2014the Attendance approves certain rulers. Perhaps it's legitimized by prediction\u2014whoever rules is whoever was going to rule. The Problem : If the Loom can identify \"leadership patterns,\" why wouldn't you use them? A ruler with a leadership pattern will lead better. Ignoring pattern information seems foolish. But pattern-based selection creates a closed loop. Leaders with \"leadership patterns\" rule because of their patterns, which means their ruling confirms their patterns, which legitimizes pattern-based selection. Possible Positions : Pattern-Merit : Leadership patterns are real and valuable. The best governance selects for pattern, trains those selected, and assigns authority based on predicted competence. Democracy is pattern-denial; meritocracy is pattern-acknowledgment. Anti-Pattern Democracy : The whole point of democratic governance is that it doesn't pre-select based on inherent qualities. Anyone can lead; the governed choose. Using pattern information corrupts the process. Loom Theocracy : The Attendance knows. It can identify not just leadership patterns but correct decisions. True governance asks the Loom and implements the answer. Human judgment is noise. Pragmatic Legitimacy : Who cares about philosophical legitimacy? Governance is legitimate if it works\u2014if it maintains order, produces prosperity, and retains sufficient support to continue. Everything else is decoration. Legitimacy Theories by Region The Heartlands: Orthodox Theocratic Legitimacy The Theory : The Weaver assigned patterns, including rulers' patterns. The current ruling families rule because their patterns indicated rulership. Resisting their authority is resisting divine design. The Great Loom Node validates rulers. A proper ruler's pattern is read publicly; the Attendance confirms their fate includes governance. Challenges to authority are pattern-deviations\u2014heresies as well as crimes. The Practice : Hereditary rule reinforced by pattern-reading. Succession crises resolved by Loom consultation. The Orthodox church legitimizes temporal authority; temporal authority protects church interests. The Tensions : What happens when a ruler's heir has an unsuitable pattern? What happens when the Loom predicts a ruler's failure? Who interprets the Loom's answers\u2014and who checks the interpreters? The Critique : This system conflates \"what will happen\" with \"what should happen.\" A pattern that predicts rulership doesn't make rulership right\u2014it makes it likely. The Heartlands has collapsed the difference. The Shattered Reaches: Consent and Contract Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from agreement, not from pattern. The governed choose their governors, directly or through representatives. Contracts bind because parties agreed, regardless of what their patterns predicted. Pattern information is available but isn't supposed to be decisive. A merchant with a \"failure pattern\" can still trade, still contract, still participate\u2014and if they succeed, their success is theirs. The Practice : City-states with varying governance models: direct assemblies, elected councils, hereditary positions constrained by charters, merchant leagues with voting weighted by stake. Pattern-based discrimination exists but is contested. Laws restricting pattern-discrimination coexist with private pattern-based pricing. The Tensions : Consent-based legitimacy assumes meaningful choice. Does it exist? Wealthy individuals and leagues have more power than their \"one vote\" suggests. Pattern-discrimination in private spheres undermines public equality. The Critique : The Shattered Reaches pretends pattern doesn't determine outcomes, while pattern actually determines outcomes through markets, reputation, and social sorting. Their equality is formal, not substantive. The Middle Waters: Colonial and Contested Legitimacy The Theory : Multiple legitimacy theories compete because multiple powers compete. Heartlands colonial governors claim Loom-sanctioned authority. Shattered Reaches merchant outposts claim contractual authority. Native island polities claim traditional authority. Colony Cults claim biological authority (the colony knows; the colony provides). The Practice : Overlapping jurisdictions, competing legal systems, forum shopping. A dispute might be resolved by Orthodox church court, merchant arbitration, traditional elder council, or colony-mediated consensus depending on who you ask and who has power. The Tensions : No single legitimacy framework commands universal acceptance. Power determines which framework applies in specific cases. The native population's frameworks are systematically disadvantaged. The Critique : The Middle Waters reveals that legitimacy theories are post-hoc justifications for power. Whoever wins the conflict gets to claim their theory was correct all along. The Vent Lands: Resource and Expertise Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from capability, specifically from controlling the geothermal resources that make the Vent Lands habitable. Those who understand the vents, who can keep the heat flowing and the toxins managed, have legitimate authority because everyone else will die without them. Pattern is acknowledged but less determinative\u2014the Vent Lands need engineers, not destiny-readers. Expertise matters more than prophecy. The Practice : Guild-based governance. The Thermal Engineers' Guild, the Sulfur Extractors' Guild, the Flesh Shaper Guilds (multiple, competing) form councils that make decisions by expertise-weighted negotiation. Political power flows to those who control critical infrastructure. Challenge a guild's authority, and discover how cold you get when the heat stops flowing. The Tensions : Expertise-legitimacy justifies technocracy. Those without technical skills are second-class citizens. Guilds have economic interests beyond the common good. What counts as \"expertise\" is defined by those who already have power. The Critique : The Vent Lands has replaced pattern-aristocracy with expertise-aristocracy. The content changed; the structure didn't. The Far Shelf: Resistance and Autonomy Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from defending the community against outside threats, primarily Heartlands imperialism and Loom-system extension. Legitimate governance is governance that keeps the Far Shelf free\u2014free from Orthodox control, free from comprehensive pattern-tracking, free from integration into the Residue economy's worst aspects. Deviation isn't crime here; it's virtue. Resisting pattern is resisting oppression. The Practice : Decentralized governance. Local assemblies with significant autonomy. Weak central coordination for external defense. Threadist and Hollow Saint influences openly present. Pattern-reading happens but isn't required. Loom coverage is thin and actively resisted. Some communities exist entirely off the Loom's network. The Tensions : \"Freedom\" often means freedom for the strong at the expense of the weak. Without Loom integration, coordination problems multiply. Resisting the Heartlands requires resources; resources require trade; trade requires compromise. The Critique : The Far Shelf's legitimacy theory is reactive\u2014defined by what it opposes rather than what it proposes. Freedom from pattern-control is clear. Freedom for what is less so. Legal Frameworks The Core Problem: Intent and Prediction Earth legal systems typically require mens rea \u2014a guilty mind. Did the person intend harm? Did they know what they were doing? Did they choose? On H\u00e1lcova, intent is partially knowable. The Loom can tell you if someone's pattern includes \"will commit violence\" or \"will deceive.\" This breaks criminal law as usually conceived. Option A: Pattern-Predictive Policing If you can predict crime, why wait for it? Arrest people whose patterns indicate future harm. Punish them before they act. Problems : - Punishing non-actions is unjust by most frameworks. - Prediction isn't certainty; false positives will be punished for nothing. - Creates the outcome it predicts (treating someone as a criminal produces criminals). Option B: Pattern-Blind Law Ignore pattern information in legal proceedings. Judge only actions, not predictions. Treat everyone as if choice is real. Problems : - You're ignoring real information. - Recidivism prediction is useful; refusing to use it costs lives. - Disadvantages those who do use pattern information (private parties, other jurisdictions). Option C: Pattern-Weighted Sentencing Let pattern information affect sentencing, not guilt. Convict based on actions; sentence based on predicted future behavior. High-recidivism patterns get longer sentences (incapacitation) or different interventions (treatment if treatable). Problems : - Still punishing the pattern, not just the action. - Unequal sentences for identical crimes based on unchosen characteristics. - Pattern-constrained populations systematically receive harsher treatment. Option D: Pattern as Mitigating Factor If someone's pattern predicted their crime, they had less choice. Less choice means less responsibility. Less responsibility means lighter punishment. Problems : - Everyone can claim their pattern made them do it. - Rewards having \"bad\" patterns (reduces consequences). - Collapses the concept of responsibility entirely. Actual Legal Variation Heartlands : Pattern-weighted sentencing plus pattern-predictive intervention for \"dangerous patterns.\" The Warden Order handles pattern-crimes (deviation, interference, evasion); secular courts handle ordinary crimes. Shattered Reaches : Officially pattern-blind, practically pattern-informed. Private arbitration uses pattern information openly. Public courts pretend not to. Middle Waters : Jurisdictional chaos. Colonial authorities, merchant courts, traditional systems, and cult mediation all compete. Pattern information matters depending on which system captures your case. Vent Lands : Expertise-based judgment. Guild courts handle guild members. Non-guild members have limited legal standing. Pattern matters less than demonstrated capability and contribution. Far Shelf : Local variation. Some communities ignore pattern entirely. Others use it for community-protective exclusion. Central coordination is minimal. Criminal Justice and Residue Production The Uncomfortable Intersection Executions produce Pattern Residue. The legal system that kills criminals is also a Residue production system. This creates incentives. The Observable Pattern : Jurisdictions with higher Residue demand have higher execution rates. Crimes that \"merit\" death penalty expand when Residue is scarce. Some jurisdictions explicitly auction execution rights (the death produces Residue; someone profits). Possible Responses : Accept and Regulate : Death is part of governance. Residue production is part of economy. Align them: execute those who deserve it; harvest the Residue; use proceeds for public good. Pretending otherwise is hypocrisy. Separate and Firewall : Residue from executions goes to neutral parties, not to the executing authority. Remove the incentive to execute for profit while acknowledging the Residue exists. Abolish Death Penalty : If execution creates economic incentive for execution, don't execute. Life imprisonment, exile, pattern-interference (if it exists), or other responses that don't produce Residue. Expose and Shame : Make the connection visible. Every death sentence comes with documentation of who profits from the Residue. Let public opinion regulate what law won't. The Heartlands Approach : Public Correction (execution for educational purposes) is an official practice. The Residue goes to the Loom infrastructure. The connection is explicit, defended on theological grounds: pattern-deviants have forfeited their pattern; their Residue serves the system they betrayed. The Far Shelf Approach : Minimal death penalty. Exile is preferred (they're not our problem anymore). When execution happens, communities often burn the body completely\u2014waste the Residue rather than let it be harvested. A statement that death isn't commodity. Property and Pattern Who Owns What\u2014and Why Does Pattern Matter? The Problem : Property rights assume you can own things, transfer things, and exclude others from things. But if your pattern determines your economic trajectory, are your property rights really yours ? If you were always going to be wealthy, is your wealth earned or destined? The Pattern-Property Intersection : Inheritance : Pattern-privileged families accumulate wealth across generations. Is this different from aristocracy? The wealth isn't legally tied to pattern\u2014but pattern predicts who accumulates it. Contracts : Pattern information affects pricing. A loan to a \"failure pattern\" costs more. A job offered to a \"success pattern\" pays more. The free market efficiently incorporates pattern discrimination. Innovation : If your pattern includes \"will invent,\" do you deserve patent rights? You didn't choose to be inventive. The pattern did the work. Possible Positions : Pattern-Libertarian : Property rights are property rights. If pattern helps you acquire property legally, the property is yours. Outcomes reflect pattern; so what? Trying to \"correct\" for pattern is theft. Pattern-Distributive : Property accumulation reflects pattern advantage, not just effort. Redistribute from pattern-privileged to pattern-constrained. The lucky shouldn't keep all their luck. Pattern-Communitarian : Property is social, not individual. The community as a whole decides allocation. Pattern information helps allocate efficiently\u2014give resources to those whose patterns will use them well. Pattern-Skeptic : Refuse to let pattern information affect property distribution. Tax wealth regardless of pattern. Provide baseline regardless of pattern. Accept inefficiency as the price of not creating caste-by-prophecy. Inter-Regional Politics The Trade Web Residue Flows : The Heartlands produces the most Residue (largest population, most warfare, most executions). They export refined Residue to regions that need it. The Middle Waters imports heavily (warm, less death, high demand for magitech). The Vent Lands imports minimally (geothermal reduces need, but high-grade Residue still valuable). The Shattered Reaches trades (imports raw, exports refined, profits on processing). The Far Shelf resists (minimal imports, local production, avoids dependency). Food Flows : The Middle Waters exports food (warmth enables agriculture). The Heartlands is roughly self-sufficient (large, diverse). The Shattered Reaches imports food (maritime diet supplemented by trade). The Vent Lands imports food (volcanic soil is limited). The Far Shelf struggles (short growing season, hunting-dependent). Labor Flows : Pattern-constrained populations migrate toward where they can survive: - Middle Waters (warmth, less Loom oversight) - Vent Lands (expertise matters more than pattern) - Far Shelf (freedom from pattern-tracking) Pattern-privileged populations concentrate where their patterns are valued: - Heartlands (pattern-merit advancement) - Shattered Reaches (commercial opportunities) The Power Balance Military Capacity : The Heartlands has the largest military, supplied by Residue abundance. They could conquer anyone\u2014if they could project force across oceans and ice. The Shattered Reaches has the best navy. They can't match Heartlands on land, but they control the seas. The Vent Lands has fortress geography. No one can invade without crossing toxic zones and thermal hazards. The Middle Waters is contested, not defensible. Whoever controls the seas controls access. The Far Shelf has space. Conquest is possible; occupation is impractical. Current Equilibrium : No one can dominate everyone. The Heartlands could crush any single rival but not all simultaneously. The Shattered Reaches can raid and embargo but not conquer land. The Vent Lands can defend but not project. The result is persistent competition without resolution. The Warden Order as Transnational Authority What They Claim The Warden Order serves pattern-integrity across all regions. Deviation is a universal threat. Heresy knows no borders. The Order operates wherever patterns exist\u2014which is everywhere. What They Actually Have Full legal authority in the Heartlands (embedded in government) Significant presence in the Shattered Reaches (treaty rights, port access) Limited presence in the Middle Waters (colonial zones only) Contested presence in the Vent Lands (guild resistance) Minimal presence in the Far Shelf (actively opposed) The Political Function The Order is a Heartlands institution claiming universal jurisdiction. Other regions accept it to varying degrees because: - Heartlands trade depends on Order-guaranteed contracts - Some deviation threats are real and cross-border - Opposing the Order means opposing the Heartlands - Internal factions find the Order useful against rivals The Resistance The Far Shelf explicitly rejects Order authority. The Vent Lands limit Order operations to specific zones. The Shattered Reaches nominally accepts but practically obstructs. The Middle Waters is battleground\u2014Order presence varies by which power controls which territory.

On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support.","title":"What Does \"Equality\" Mean?"},{"location":"halcova/governance/political_philosophy/#what-does-justice-mean","text":"On Earth : Justice typically involves assigning responsibility for actions, determining appropriate responses to harm, and ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom predicted the action. Did the person choose it, or was choice an illusion? Can you punish someone for doing what they were always going to do? Can you reward someone for inevitability? The Problem : If actions are genuinely fated, punishment is incoherent. You're punishing someone for being what they were always going to be. That's not justice\u2014it's suffering added to suffering. If actions are genuinely chosen despite prediction, then deviants prove choice exists. But most people don't deviate. Are they choosing to comply, or unable to resist? Possible Positions : Consequentialist Justice : Don't worry about desert. Justice is about outcomes. Punish if punishment prevents future harm. Reward if reward produces future benefit. The person's \"choice\" is irrelevant; what matters is what works. Expressivist Justice : Punishment expresses social condemnation regardless of metaphysics. We punish not because the criminal \"deserves\" it, but because punishment communicates values. The audience matters more than the target. Restorative Justice : Forget punishment. Justice is about repairing harm. If someone's pattern predicted they'd harm others, the pattern doesn't matter\u2014the harm does. Restore the victim; reintegrate the harmer; move on. Fatalist Justice : Accept that justice is impossible in any meaningful sense. What we call \"justice\" is actually just pattern-expression.

Don't pretend there's more.","title":"What Does \"Justice\" Mean?"},{"location":"halcova/governance/political_philosophy/#what-does-consent-mean","text":"On Earth : Consent means voluntary agreement, free from coercion, based on adequate information. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. If someone manipulates you into \"consenting,\" but the Loom predicted you'd be manipulated, did you consent? Can a pattern-constrained person ever meaningfully consent to anything? The Problem : Every pact, contract, and political arrangement rests on consent. If consent is illusory, every agreement is void. But if we treat consent as illusory, we've justified unlimited coercion (nothing matters anyway) or unlimited paternalism (we know better than you what you'll choose). Possible Positions : Experienced Consent : What matters is the subjective experience of choosing. Even if the choice was predicted, the person experienced deliberation, weighed options, and felt like they decided. That's consent enough. Structural Consent : Individual consent is less important than structural fairness. If the process that produces \"consent\" is rigged\u2014if pattern-constrained people are systematically pushed toward agreements that harm them\u2014then individual consent legitimizes nothing. Predictive Consent : Use the Loom to determine what someone would consent to under ideal conditions. If you know they'd agree to X if they fully understood it, you can act as if they've agreed. (This is terrifying but internally consistent.) Consent Skepticism : Consent is a useful fiction. Treat agreements as binding because a system of binding agreements works better than the alternative\u2014not because consent is metaphysically meaningful.","title":"What Does \"Consent\" Mean?"},{"location":"halcova/governance/political_philosophy/#what-legitimizes-authority","text":"On Earth : Authority is typically legitimized by: divine mandate, consent of the governed, tradition, expertise, or force.

Perhaps it's legitimized by Loom-sanction\u2014the Attendance approves certain rulers. Perhaps it's legitimized by prediction\u2014whoever rules is whoever was going to rule. The Problem : If the Loom can identify \"leadership patterns,\" why wouldn't you use them? A ruler with a leadership pattern will lead better. Ignoring pattern information seems foolish. But pattern-based selection creates a closed loop. Leaders with \"leadership patterns\" rule because of their patterns, which means their ruling confirms their patterns, which legitimizes pattern-based selection. Possible Positions : Pattern-Merit : Leadership patterns are real and valuable. The best governance selects for pattern, trains those selected, and assigns authority based on predicted competence. Democracy is pattern-denial; meritocracy is pattern-acknowledgment. Anti-Pattern Democracy : The whole point of democratic governance is that it doesn't pre-select based on inherent qualities. Anyone can lead; the governed choose. Using pattern information corrupts the process. Loom Theocracy : The Attendance knows. It can identify not just leadership patterns but correct decisions. True governance asks the Loom and implements the answer. Human judgment is noise. Pragmatic Legitimacy : Who cares about philosophical legitimacy?

For focused treatments, see: governance_structures.md (regional power structures), political_philosophy.md (philosophical questions), and legal_frameworks.md (legal systems and crimes). Overview Every political system on H\u00e1lcova faces the same fundamental challenge: the Loom exists . The Loom reads patterns. It predicts behavior. It knows\u2014or creates\u2014fate. This isn't theology or philosophy. It's infrastructure. The predictions are accurate enough that ignoring them is economically irrational, and using them is morally catastrophic. Magic makes it worse. The Five Arts let people harvest the dead, reshape bodies, trade souls, cannibalize futures, and merge with alien organisms. Every political system must answer: Who gets to use these powers? Under what constraints? With what oversight? The answers vary. None of them work well. The Heartlands: Theocratic Integration Political Structure The Heartlands operates as a theocratic monarchy with parallel secular and ecclesiastical authority. The Crown handles mundane governance\u2014taxation, military, foreign policy. The Orthodox Church of the Weaver handles pattern matters\u2014Loom access, deviation prosecution, fate certification. In practice, nothing is cleanly divided. Pattern affects everything. A trade dispute involves pattern-certified contracts. A succession crisis requires Loom readings. A military campaign needs pattern-intelligence on enemy commanders. The Church has its fingers in every pie because pattern is in every pie. The Crown maintains legitimacy through pattern-validation. The ruling family's S\u00f3rscad includes \"governance fate\"\u2014the Loom predicts they'll rule, therefore they should rule. Circular logic that holds because everyone with power benefits from it holding. The Council of Threads advises the Crown: major noble houses, high clergy, Warden Order representatives, selected merchants. Formally advisory. Practically, the Crown can't act against unified Council opposition. The Warden Order enforces pattern-compliance. They answer to Church hierarchy but operate with significant autonomy. Their Attunement gives them abilities no one else has\u2014pattern-sense, deviation-detection, enhanced physical capacity. Magic Regulation The Heartlands doesn't ban magic. It monopolizes it. Core Binding : Licensed and regulated. The Orthodox Church maintains binding facilities where approved practitioners create echoes under supervision. Private binding is illegal but common. The Church controls Residue distribution\u2014want to bind? Buy your Residue from approved sources, register your binding, submit to periodic inspections. Flesh Shaping : Heavily restricted. The Orthodox position is that bodies are Weaver-given; reshaping them is soft heresy. Medical applications permitted under Church supervision. Cosmetic or enhancement shaping illegal. Combat modifications are treason. Reality: thriving black market serves those with money to bribe. Pact Summoning : Officially forbidden. The Elsewhere is the enemy of divine order. Pact Summoners face execution without exception. Reality: The Warden Order's Attunement looks suspiciously like a pact. Certain old families have \"ancestral arrangements.\" The rule is: official pacts are forbidden; institutional pacts are classified. Fate Threading : Capital heresy. No licenses. No exceptions. Threaders hunted with same intensity as deviants. The Warden Order has specialized units\u2014Unravelers\u2014trained specifically to identify and terminate Threaders. Colony Summoning : Tolerated at margins, prohibited at core. Legal in frontier areas. In the Heartlands proper, hosts face significant civil disabilities\u2014can't hold office, can't testify in Church courts, can't access certain Loom services. Fate System Integration Pattern Certification : Required for most activities. Employment, housing, marriage, trade, travel\u2014all require proof of pattern-reading and absence of deviation flags. Without pattern documentation, you don't legally exist. Pattern Evidence : Admissible in all courts. Pattern-prediction about defendant's likely behavior can support charges, justify pre-trial detention, influence sentencing. Deviation as Crime : The Heartlands criminalizes acting against your pattern's predictions. Deviation prosecution is selective\u2014wealthy deviants negotiate rehabilitation; poor deviants face Correction. Pre-Crime Monitoring : \"Dangerous patterns\" can be flagged for monitoring. Registration requirements. Travel restrictions. Employment limitations. Creates the outcomes it predicts. The Warden Order Jurisdiction : Pattern-crimes anywhere the Order can reach. Deviation, fraud, evasion, interference, trafficking. Powers : Detain without civilian oversight. Conduct pattern-readings without consent. Enter premises without warrant. Execute Pattern-Severance for capital pattern-crimes. The Attunement : Links Wardens to the Loom. They can sense deviation, feel pattern-disturbance, detect magic use. Cost is lifespan, flexibility, and capacity for doubt. Law and Order Ecclesiastical Courts : Handle pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy, unauthorized magic. Penalties include penance, property forfeiture, exile, and Correction (public execution producing Residue assigned to Church). Secular Courts : Handle ordinary crimes. Penalties include fines, imprisonment, labor service, and execution (Residue goes to jurisdiction). Residue from Justice : Executions produce Residue. Jurisdictions with shortages have higher execution rates. The legal system has financial interest in death. The Shattered Reaches: Fragmented Pragmatism Political Structure No unified government. Dozens of city-states, island kingdoms, merchant leagues, free ports. The only commonalities are maritime orientation and contract fetishism. The Leagues provide regional coordination. Amber League (Residue), Salt League (fishing), Iron League (manufacturing), Counting League (banking). Not governments, but they exercise governmental functions\u2014currency, contract enforcement, dispute resolution. Magic Regulation No unified policy. Common patterns emerge from commercial logic. Core Binding : Generally legal, lightly regulated. Registration and periodic inspection. Black markets for sensitive bindings. Flesh Shaping : Legal in most polities, regulated as medical practice. Guild certification required. Combat modifications restricted but available. Pact Summoning : Status varies wildly. Some criminalize all pacts. Some regulate as contracts. Most prohibit involuntary substitution\u2014creates market for \"voluntary\" substitution from desperate people. Fate Threading : Generally unregulated. Pattern-skepticism extends to Threading. Colony Summoning : Legal almost everywhere, regulated as health and safety matter. Fate System Integration Pattern Privacy : Most polities recognize pattern as private information. Can refuse readings. Pattern discrimination prohibited in public accommodations. Reality: private parties use pattern constantly. Pattern Evidence : Officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely. No Pre-Crime : Punished for what you did, not what you might do. Exception: contract-based restrictions are enforceable. The Warden Order Operates under bilateral treaties. Specific crimes only. Local cooperation required. No Pattern-Severance without local authorization. Defined duration. Law and Order Contract Supremacy : Written agreements are sacred. Courts exist primarily to interpret and enforce contracts. Maritime Law : Shared traditions recognized across polities. Arbitration : Most disputes go to private arbiters. Faster, more expert, allows pattern evidence. The Middle Waters: Colonial Patchwork Political Structure Not a region with a government\u2014a region with competing governments. Heartlands Colonies : Governors appointed, pattern-certified. Standard colonial administration. Reaches Trading Posts : League-operated commercial enclaves. Minimal government. Vent Lands Footholds : Guild-operated facilities. Governed by guild protocols. Native Polities : Surviving indigenous governance\u2014island kingdoms, elder councils, Colony Cult communities. Contested Zones : Multiple powers claim authority. Governance by whoever has force present. Magic Regulation Depends on who's in charge. Heartlands rules in colonies. Reaches rules in posts. Guild protocols in Vent facilities. Indigenous traditions in native polities. Colony Cult areas treat Colony Summoning as sacred. Some native communities have Pact Summoning traditions predating Orthodox prohibition. Fate System Integration Fragmented and contested. Full integration in Heartlands colonies. Optional in Reaches posts. Available but without legal weight in Vent facilities. Varies in native polities\u2014some integrated, some resist entirely. Native populations often understand Loom as colonizer infrastructure. Resistance to Loom is resistance to cultural imperialism. The Warden Order Full jurisdiction in colonies. Claims jurisdiction elsewhere; others don't recognize it. Pursuing suspects outside colonies means requesting cooperation or military operation. Law and Order Colonial law in Heartlands colonies\u2014harsher penalties, fewer protections. Plural legal systems in contested zones. More political violence than any other region. The Vent Lands: Guild Technocracy Political Structure Guild Federation : Primary guilds control critical infrastructure. Thermal Engineers maintain geothermal systems. Sulfur Extractors handle toxic operations. Flesh Shapers Consortium dominates biological industries. Makers Guild handles manufacturing. Merchants Assembly manages trade. Non-Guild Population : Limited legal standing, can't access guild-controlled resources directly, depend on guild good behavior. Two-tier system with explicit hierarchy. Magic Regulation Expertise-driven through guild structures. Core Binding : Legal, guild-supervised. Remembrancers' Guild handles most binding. Flesh Shaping : The Vent Lands specialty. Multiple competing guilds. World's leaders in shaping. Things illegal in Heartlands are routine here. Pact Summoning : Not criminalized. Regulated as contracts. Specialist guilds advise on Elsewhere negotiation. Fate Threading : Unregulated. Some guilds employ Threaders for specific purposes. Colony Summoning : The other Vent Lands specialty. Colony Engineering advanced here. Hosting common and normalized. Fate System Integration Expertise Over Pattern : What you can do matters more than what you're predicted to do. Guild advancement depends on demonstrated capability. No Pattern-Crimes : Deviation isn't criminalized. Pattern fraud addressed through contract law. The Warden Order Guild-negotiated limits. Specific violations only. Guild cooperation required. No independent operations. Minimal presence. Law and Order Guild Justice : Members subject to guild discipline. Penalties include fines, status reduction, expulsion. Inter-Guild Courts : Disputes between guilds. Judges from neutral guilds. Precedent-based, expertise-weighted. Safety Focus : Much law concerns safety. Geothermal systems, toxic zones, volcanic hazards require regulation. The Far Shelf: Decentralized Resistance Political Structure No Central Government : By design. Settled by people who left or fled centralized regions. Community Assemblies : Each settlement governs itself. Decision-making varies\u2014consensus, voting, elder authority, strong chiefs. Regional Coordination : Occasional gatherings for external threats. No standing structure. Magic Regulation Minimal to none. Local customs vary. Core Binding : Generally accepted. Ancestor veneration traditions make binding culturally comfortable. Flesh Shaping : Varies by community. Pact Summoning : Many communities have ongoing Elsewhere relationships predating Orthodox prohibition. Hollow Saints theology originated here. Fate Threading : Sometimes celebrated. Threading represents resistance to fixed fate. Colony Summoning : Accepted, especially in colder areas. Fate System Integration Active resistance. No Pattern Certification : Most communities don't require it. Some have no Loom access. Deviation Is Not Crime : Often virtue. Successful deviants admired. Pattern Privacy : Where Loom exists, pattern is deeply private. Forced reading is assault. The Warden Order No legitimate authority. Operating openly risks arrest or violence. Covert operations only. Some communities offer bounties for captured Wardens. Law and Order Community Justice : Each community handles own disputes. No regional courts. Restorative Focus : Repair harm, reintegrate offender, exile as last resort. External Threat Focus : Much \"law\" concerns how to respond to Heartlands incursion. Cross-Regional Dynamics Magic Flows Flesh Shapers trained in Vent Lands serve clients in Heartlands (discreetly) and Reaches (openly) Pact Summoners flee Heartlands for Far Shelf or Reaches Fate Threaders survive longest in Far Shelf Colony Hosts seek Vent Lands for advanced integration Core Binders practice everywhere; sophisticated work in Heartlands and Reaches Residue Flows Heartlands produces most, exports refined Reaches imports raw, exports refined, profits on processing Middle Waters imports heavily Vent Lands imports minimally Far Shelf resists trade Jurisdictional Conflicts Extradition : Heartlands demands; others sometimes comply, sometimes refuse. Hot Pursuit : Treaties say no; practice varies. Conflicting Judgments : A practitioner convicted in Heartlands may live legally in Reaches. The Uneasy Equilibrium No region can impose its system on others. Heartlands can't project force effectively. Reaches controls seas but not land. Vent Lands can defend but not attack. Far Shelf can absorb any invasion. The system persists because everyone fears what would replace it.

Category One: Core Binding The Art of Holding the Dead Fundamental Principle When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental. The core is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned. Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't. That's the relationship. The Core What It Is The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete - Deaths in old age after long decline Anchors Physical Form A core needs a home. The anchor is a physical object that houses the bound echo\u2014a prison dressed as a portrait. Anchors can take many forms: - Carved figurines or statuettes - Painted tiles or tablets - Etched metal plates - Clay tablets with pressed images - Bone carvings - Jewelry settings - Decorated containers The anchor must depict the bound echo. This can happen two ways: Natural manifestation : The anchor changes when a core is bound to it, the image of the echo appearing on or in the material as if etched by invisible hands. Artistic creation : The binder creates the depiction deliberately, crafting an image of the creature to be bound before or during the binding process. Looking at a binder's collection tells you who they carry. The echoes watch out from their prisons, rendered in whatever medium houses them. Carrying Capacity A binder can carry as many anchors as they can physically transport. The limitation isn't storage\u2014it's activation. Summoning and Limits Activation To summon an echo, a binder activates its anchor. The echo manifests physically, drawn from the anchor into material reality. It can interact with the world, fight, speak, perform tasks\u2014everything the living creature could do. The Bottleneck Multiple simultaneous activations create problems: Resonance interference : Too many active echoes at once causes bleeding between them. Their memories mix. Their identities blur. Two echoes might start sharing the same thought, speaking in unison, losing track of which one is which. Physical drain : Every active echo taxes the binder. The more echoes active, the greater the exhaustion. Running too many is like holding your breath\u2014eventually something gives. The limit is personal. Some binders can run four echoes comfortably. Others struggle with two. Veterans know their limit exactly. Amateurs find out the hard way, usually when their echoes start merging into something that used to be two people and is now neither. Upkeep: The Resource [RESOURCE NAME: TBD \u2014 Placeholder for Conlang] Echoes don't maintain themselves. They need fuel\u2014a consumable resource that keeps them coherent and stable. What It Does The resource feeds the anchor, which feeds the echo. Without regular doses: - The echo becomes confused - Memories fragment and scramble - Identity degrades - Eventually, what you summon isn't what you bound\u2014it's a broken thing that used to be a person Resource Economy The resource creates an entire economy: - Harvesters who collect it from sources - Refiners who process it into usable form - Merchants who trade it - Smugglers who move it illegally - Black markets for rare or potent variants Consumption Rates Simple echoes (animals, simple minds): low consumption Complex echoes (humans, intelligent creatures): moderate consumption Powerful or traumatic echoes: high consumption Echoes that have become aware : highest consumption An echo that realizes it's dead burns through resources faster. The awareness creates strain\u2014the echo fighting against its condition, the anchor struggling to contain something that wants out. Aware echoes require constant upkeep and intensive focus. Quality Matters The resource can be: - Adulterated (stretched with fillers\u2014causes instability) - Counterfeited (fake\u2014causes degradation) - Aged (loses potency over time) - Fresh (most effective, most expensive) Experienced binders can assess quality by look, smell, even taste. They know when they're being cheated. They know when the resource is good enough to maintain a difficult echo, or only good enough for simple ones. Scarcity as Plot Peace is expensive for binders. Whatever the resource turns out to be, it's easier to acquire during times of mass death\u2014wars, plagues, disasters. Stability means scarcity. Scarcity means hard choices about which echoes get maintained and which get neglected. Decay: Echo Bleed The One-Way Corruption Holding echoes costs you. Not in resource or effort\u2014in self . The echoes bleed into you. Their memories, sensations, preferences, fears\u2014they leak from anchor to holder over time. Manifestations Phantom sensations : You feel echoes of how they died. Carry someone who burned, and your skin prickles with heat. Carry someone who drowned, and you're short of breath in open air. Behavioral drift : You pick up habits that aren't yours. Preferences shift. You hate a food you used to love. You flinch at dogs, and you've never had a bad experience with dogs\u2014but one of your echoes did. Memory intrusion : Flashes of their life. A spouse's face you've never seen. A childhood home that isn't yours. The more you carry, the more other lives crowd into your head. Awareness Accelerates Decay An echo that knows it's dead creates more bleed. The awareness is like a wound that won't close\u2014the echo's distress seeping constantly into the binder. The Long-Term Cost Old binders are strange. Their mannerisms are patchwork\u2014bits and pieces of everyone they've ever carried. Some lose track of which memories are theirs. Some find their original personality buried under layers of accumulated dead. The joke among binders: \"Carry enough echoes, and you don't know who you are. Carry them long enough, and it doesn't matter\u2014you're all of them now.\" Release It's Possible A binder can release an echo. Break the bond, let the core dissipate, allow what remains to finally end. It's Rare Reasons not to release: Money : Echoes are assets. Valuable ones are worth fortunes. Spite : \"You don't get to rest until I say so.\" Revenge : \"You'll serve me until I'm done with you.\" Nostalgia : \"I can't let go. They're all I have left of her.\" Love : \"If I release him, he's really gone. As long as I hold him, he's still here.\" Exhaustion : \"Releasing feels like losing them again. I already lost them once.\" Most binders hold on long past the point of reason. The relationship between binder and echo is complicated\u2014captor and prisoner, owner and owned, but also something that can feel like partnership, even family. Releasing is admitting it's over. Most people aren't good at that. Opposition The echoes don't know they're dead. So who objects? The living. Family members : Someone recognizes a bound echo. Their mother. Their brother. Their child. The echo doesn't understand why this stranger is crying and begging the binder to \"let them go.\" The family member understands too well. Religious/philosophical groups : Traditions that believe the dead deserve passage, that binding is desecration, that what binders do is cosmic crime. Some are peaceful advocates. Some are violent abolitionists. Former binders : People who released their echoes and now crusade against the practice. Converts are the most zealous preachers. \"I know what it's like to hold someone against their will. I know what I told myself to justify it. I'm not letting anyone else live that lie.\" Governments : Not opposed to binding\u2014opposed to uncontrolled binding. They want to regulate who gets to keep their dead. Registration. Taxation. Restrictions on certain echoes (public figures, criminals, military personnel). The opposition isn't moral; it's bureaucratic. Economy The Trade in Death Cores are commodities. Rare and powerful ones command high prices. An entire economy exists around death: Poachers : Hunting rare creatures specifically for their cores Assassins : Paid to kill specific targets so their cores can be harvested Battlefield scavengers : Following armies, collecting from the dead before anyone else can Professional harvesters : Legitimate (sometimes) businesspeople who specialize in core extraction Brokers : Connecting buyers with sellers, taking a cut Appraisers : Determining the value of a core before sale Storage facilities : Keeping anchors safe for clients who can't maintain their own collections Wars aren't just political events. They're market opportunities. Every battle produces inventory. Anomalies What Happens If You Extract a Core from Something Still Alive? It shouldn't be possible. The core is what remains after death. It forms because of death. But some have tried. Some have succeeded, after a fashion. The results are anomalies : The original creature, still alive, but wrong . Missing something fundamental. Walking and talking but hollow in a way that unnerves everyone who meets them. The extracted core, bound to an anchor, but wrong . An echo of someone who isn't dead, containing memories the original is still making. Or both. A living person and their echo, existing simultaneously, neither quite complete. Anomalies are rare, disturbing, and valuable to certain collectors. They're also deeply unstable\u2014the situation resolves eventually, usually badly for everyone involved. Terminology (To Be Developed in Conlang) The essence/soul concept: Core \u2192 [L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9] The act of binding: Binding \u2192 [C\u00f3itcai] The summoned manifestation: Echo \u2192 [TBD] The physical housing: Anchor \u2192 [TBD] The practitioner: Binder \u2192 [TBD] The consumable resource: [TBD] \u2192 [TBD] The corruption effect: Bleed \u2192 [TBD] Category Two: Flesh Shaping (Homunculus Crafting) The Art of Building Servants Fundamental Principle Flesh Shaping creates homunculi \u2014constructed servants built from raw materials and animated with blood. Unlike echoes, homunculi never lived. They have no history, no memories, no existence prior to their creation. They are made , not captured. This sounds cleaner than Core Binding. It isn't. The horror is different, not lesser. Creation Raw Materials A homunculus is built from physical components: Flesh (from corpses, butcher shops, battlefields) Bone (structural support, framework) Clay (crude but durable) Metal (for specialized purposes) Wax (malleable, temporary) Leather (flexible, resilient) Different materials produce different results. The medium shapes the creation: Bone-wrights build skeletal servants\u2014light, fast, clicking when they move Flesh-sculptors work in meat and muscle\u2014things that bleed when cut, that smell like bodies Clay-formers make crude laborers\u2014durable, slow, expressionless Metal-smiths forge mechanical servants\u2014precise, cold, expensive A crafter typically specializes. Working in multiple materials requires different skills, different tools, different mindsets. The Spark: Blood Materials alone produce nothing but a statue. The homunculus needs life , and that life comes from blood. Creation Cost The crafter bleeds into their creation. Not a nick, not a small cut\u2014a letting . The amount scales with complexity: Simple tool (a fetching hand, a watching eye): A cupful. Dizziness, hunger afterward. Basic servant (follows instructions, performs labor): Several cups. Pale for days, sleeping hard, eating constantly. Soldier construct (built for violence): Enough to leave you bedridden for a week. Some crafters need transfusions. Mimic (passes for human): Crafters have died on the table finishing these, bled out with hands still inside the chest cavity, shaping the last chamber of a heart. The homunculus must be sparked with the crafter's own blood . This is the bond. This is why it serves you and not someone else. Your blood is the signature on the contract. Conjuring and Tethering Tethering A completed homunculus can be bound to a token \u2014a small object similar to a Core Binder's anchor. The homunculus was made for this token, crafted with the binding built in from the start. When dormant, the homunculus collapses into the token. Not destroyed\u2014folded. Compressed. Waiting. Where it waits is unclear. Crafters disagree. Some say the homunculus enters a kind of stasis. Others believe it exists in a pocket dimension tied to the token. Others think it simply ceases to exist until summoned, recreated each time from the pattern stored in the binding. Nobody knows for certain. The homunculi don't remember dormancy, or if they do, they can't describe it. Summoning Activate the token, and the homunculus unfolds back into reality. Fast for simple constructs\u2014they snap into existence almost instantly. Slower for complex ones\u2014they need time to become , flesh knitting together, bones locking into place, the body assembling itself from nothing visible. Every summoning costs fresh blood. The homunculus drinks when it wakes. Small ones need a palm-slice and a minute of feeding. Larger ones need significantly more. A crafter summoning a soldier-construct is opening veins, not cutting palms. Upkeep: The Blood Economy Daily Feeding The token drinks too. When you collapse a homunculus back to dormancy, the token takes a drop. Just a drop. Daily maintenance, whether you summon that day or not. Miss a day: The token goes cold, inert. You'll need a full summoning-price to wake it again. Miss a week: The homunculus inside starts to degrade. Patterns corrupting. Miss a month: What comes out when you finally feed it won't be what you put in. A crafter is always bleeding . Six constructs means six drops a day, minimum. Morning ritual: a knife and a row of hungry objects. The Homunculus Doesn't Care Whose Blood It needs the crafter's blood to be made . But once it exists, it can be sustained on anyone's. The temptation is always there: - You're tapped out, anemic, exhausted - There's a prisoner in the basement - There's a beggar who won't be missed - There's animal blood available (but it makes constructs sluggish, wrong) - Human blood works best - Your blood works best of all, but you're running out The Supply Chain Where does the blood come from? Bloodhouses : Places where the desperate sell by the pint. Technically legal in some jurisdictions. The sellers are gaunt, hollow-eyed, always cold. They don't last long. Fresh ones cycle in. Nobody asks where the old ones went. Wartime crafters : Military Flesh Shapers have access to prisoners, wounded enemies, civilians in occupied territory. A soldier-construct requires a lot of fuel. The supply chain gets dark fast. The black market : Blood dealers who don't ask questions about sourcing. The Homunculus Knows It can smell blood. It can tell the difference between: - Willing and unwilling - Healthy and sick - Its maker and a stranger - Fear-blood and calm-blood Some crafters swear their constructs behave differently depending on what they've been fed: - More vicious on fear-blood - Sluggish on the blood of the drugged - Eager when they've tasted someone they'll meet again What This Does to Crafters Physical Markers Pale. Always. The healthy glow is for people who keep their blood inside. Hungry. Constantly eating, body trying to rebuild what they keep giving away. They're thin despite the meals. Track marks. The crook of the elbow, the wrist, anywhere veins are easy to reach. Old scars and fresh wounds. Behavioral Changes Territorial about blood. Other people's injuries make them attentive in uncomfortable ways. A nosebleed at dinner and every crafter in the room goes still for a second. They know things about blood they shouldn't. Can tell by smell if someone's sick. Can taste pregnancy, disease, fear. The knowledge seeps in. Occupational hazard. The Long-Term Cost The old ones are brittle. Bones thin. Healing slow. They've given too much for too long. Some switch to \"volunteers\" early, preserving themselves at the cost of others. Some hold out until their body forces the choice. Some just... stop making the choice and let a construct drink the last of them. A Flesh Shaper who's been practicing for decades is a medical wreck held together by stubbornness and careful feeding schedules. Hierarchy of Constructs Tools Simple, single-purpose. A hand that fetches. A mouth that repeats messages. An eye that watches. Barely present\u2014more automation than entity. Cheap to make, cheap to maintain. Every crafter has a few. Servants More complex. Can follow multi-step instructions, adapt to obstacles, perform labor. They have enough presence to seem almost like people, though nobody's fooled up close. The backbone of any serious crafter's stable. Soldiers Built for violence. Expensive in materials and spark\u2014a soldier-construct might represent months of work and enough blood loss to hospitalize the crafter. They degrade faster than other types. Combat tears them up, and they don't heal\u2014they have to be repaired . Field repairs are crude. Proper maintenance requires a workshop, materials, and more blood. Mimics The dangerous ones. Built to pass as human. Built to fool people who know what homunculi look like. Built, sometimes, to impersonate a specific person. Requirements: - Exceptional skill - Massive vitality investment - Often a core fragment from someone who knew how to be a person (burned in the creation, not bound\u2014but the traces remain) Mimics are assassins' tools. Spies. Replacements. Most societies ban them outright. Crafters who build them are either very powerful, very well-protected, or very desperate. The Homunculus Perspective What They Want They're made to serve. They don't want things the way people do. Except blood. Blood is the one drive that's built in, inescapable. A well-fed homunculus is loyal, precise, obedient. A hungry one gets creative about fulfilling its primary need. Neglected Constructs What happens when a homunculus isn't fed properly: Returns to dormancy on its own, drinking the token to survive Stands very still near sleeping people \"Accidentally\" causes injuries during tasks Simply attacks, if starved long enough This isn't rebellion. It isn't malice. It's just need \u2014the only need they have\u2014expressing itself when the leash gets loose. Do They Have Experiences? Complex homunculi exhibit preferences, aversions, something that looks like pain when damaged. They respond to stimuli in ways that suggest inner states. But they never lived. They have no history, no childhood, no formation. Whatever they experience, it's not the same as what people experience. Is it real? Does it matter if it acts real? Crafters disagree. Some treat their constructs as tools. Some treat them as servants. A few treat them almost as children\u2014made things that deserve consideration despite their origins. The homunculi themselves don't seem to have opinions on the matter. Or if they do, they don't share them. Moral Angle What Does Flesh Shaping Exploit? The crafter : Every homunculus costs a piece of you. Noble self-sacrifice or slow suicide dressed as craft? The materials : Where do you get the flesh? The bone? Flesh Shapers haunt graveyards, battlefields, slaughterhouses. They make deals with executioners. They show up after disasters with empty carts. The blood supply : When your blood runs low, whose do you use? The ethics get murky fast. The homunculi : Do they deserve consideration? They experience something. They can suffer, or at least they act like they can. Does their artificial origin excuse how we treat them? The crafter who says \"it's just a construct\" sounds a lot like the binder who says \"it's just an echo.\" The rationalization is different. The function is the same. Opposition and Social Position How Other Practitioners See Them Core Binders view Flesh Shapers as butchers playing with corpse-meat. \"At least we work with what was . You're just... building things out of scraps.\" Pact Summoners don't understand why anyone would work so hard when you could just make a deal. Fate Threaders see them as limited\u2014\"You can only make what you can build.\" Colony Summoners and Flesh Shapers have professional overlap. Some respect. Some rivalry. Similar materials, different methods. Public Perception Flesh Shapers are openly unsettling. Their workshops smell like death. Everyone knows where the materials come from. In some places, they're tolerated as necessary\u2014military applications, dangerous labor, tasks nobody else will do. In others, they're shunned. The craft is legal but shameful. You hire one when you need one, and you don't invite them to dinner. Legal Status Regulation focuses on the crafter , not the product: Licensing requirements Restrictions on mimic construction Blood sourcing laws (where they exist) Limits on military applications The homunculus itself isn't a citizen, was never a citizen, can't become a citizen. It's property. What happens to it is the crafter's business, as long as the crafter follows the rules. Terminology (To Be Developed in Conlang) The practice: Flesh Shaping \u2192 [TBD] The created servant: Homunculus \u2192 [TBD] The tethering object: Token \u2192 [TBD] The practitioner: Crafter / Flesh Shaper \u2192 [TBD] The blood cost: The Letting \u2192 [TBD] Construction specialties: Bone-wright, Flesh-sculptor, Clay-former \u2192 [TBD] The dangerous ones: Mimic \u2192 [TBD] Category Three: Pact Summoning (The Elsewhere) The Art of Dealing with the Outside Fundamental Principle Somewhere adjacent to reality, things exist. Not dead things\u2014Core Binding covers the dead. Not made things\u2014Flesh Shaping builds those. These are entities that are , fully and independently, in a place that isn't here. The Elsewhere is what practitioners call that place. The entities there have their own drives, their own intelligence, their own agendas. For reasons nobody fully understands, some of them are willing to answer when called. Pact Summoning is negotiation. Unlike the other Arts, you're not in control. You're making a deal with something that has its own reasons for saying yes. The Elsewhere What It Is Mystery is load-bearing here. The Elsewhere isn't mapped, isn't understood, isn't safe to investigate. What's known: It's not an afterlife. The dead don't go there. Cores don't come from there. It's not a spirit world. It's not a reflection of our reality. It's somewhere genuinely alien. Time works differently. Entities reference events that haven't happened yet. They remember pacts made with summoners' ancestors\u2014ancestors who haven't made those pacts yet, by our timeline. Space is wrong. The few descriptions from people who claim to have glimpsed it are contradictory. Too many angles. Colors that hurt. Distance that doesn't correlate with movement. The entities there aren't gods. Aren't demons in a religious sense. Aren't faeries in a folkloric sense. Different cultures use all those words, but none of them are accurate. They're other . Intelligences that evolved\u2014if \"evolved\" means anything there\u2014in a place with different rules than ours. Why They Answer Unknown. Theories: They want something from our world that they can't get otherwise Our reality is entertainment, or food, or raw material They're curious They're compelled by the calling ritual (unlikely\u2014they can choose not to respond) Different entities have different reasons The uncertainty is part of the horror. You're dealing with something, and you don't know why it's dealing with you. The Pact Formation Making a pact requires contact: Rituals : Specific words, gestures, offerings that attract attention from the Elsewhere Thin places : Locations where the boundary between here and there is weak Resonant objects : Items that have been touched by Elsewhere influence, that carry traces of prior contact Bloodlines : Families that have dealt before. The connection persists across generations. The entities remember. The entity chooses whether to engage. You can call. It doesn't have to answer. Some calls go unanswered for years. Some are answered immediately. Some are answered by something other than what you were trying to reach. Negotiation Pact terms are negotiated. Both parties bring something to the table. The entity is at least as intelligent as you. Probably more intelligent. Certainly more experienced\u2014it's been doing this longer than your civilization has existed. The pact, once formed, binds both sides. Break it and there are consequences. For you. Possibly for the entity too, which is why they're careful about terms. The Price Is You The entity wants your core . The same thing a Core Binder would harvest from your corpse. But the Elsewhere entity takes it in installments. Every summoning. Every use of the pact's power. Every favor called in. Each one costs a piece of you. You feel it: - A coldness that doesn't warm - Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix - The sense that you're less than you were yesterday, in a way you can't name The Honest Horror Pact entities are honest. That's part of what makes them terrifying. No tricks. No hidden clauses. No surprises. The entity tells you exactly what's going to happen: I will eat you, slowly, and in exchange you get this. And people say yes anyway. The Math of Desperation Why Would Anyone Agree? Power now, death later. For someone with nothing, that's a trade worth making. You get decades of capability in exchange for a shorter life. If your life was going to be short and powerless anyway, this is an upgrade. The timeline is negotiable. Small pacts, small bites. Use the power sparingly, and you might get decades before the debt comes due. Use it constantly, and you might have months. Some people don't plan to live long anyway. Soldiers. Assassins. The terminally ill. The suicidal. The entity offers a way to matter before the end. Arrogance. The belief that you'll find a way out. That you're smarter than everyone who came before. That you'll be the one to beat the system. You won't be. But you'll believe it until you don't. Substitution You Can Pay with Other People's Souls You can only offer your own core to one entity. That's your primary pact. But you can offset your debt by providing other cores. The entity doesn't care whose core it gets. A core is a core. But you have to deliver . Classic Arrangements First-born clauses : The child isn't born yet. You're mortgaging a future you can't see. By the time the debt comes due, you've had years to love what you promised away. Seventh son of a seventh son : Rare cores are worth more. One exceptional soul might buy you years off your own debt. Designated sacrifices : Prisoners. Slaves. The defeated. If you can deliver someone's core to the entity, it counts. How you get it is your problem. Secondary Markets This creates economies within economies: Pact summoners hunting for substitutes Cults breeding or kidnapping to pay their founders' debts Wars fought partly to generate currency for Elsewhere transactions Noble families trading heirs' futures for political advantage Criminal organizations offering \"debt relief\" in exchange for services The entities don't judge. They just collect. Breaking the Pact You Can't The terms are the terms. You agreed. The entity will collect what it's owed, one way or another. However The entity can die. They're not gods. They're powerful, alien, long-lived\u2014but not immortal. Kill your pact-partner and the contract dissolves. You keep whatever's left of your core. This is rare. Elsewhere entities are hard to find when they don't want to be found. Harder to hurt when they're found. They know they have enemies, and they're careful. But it happens. Some summoners spend their entire lives searching for a way to kill what they owe. Other entities might help. Faction politics in the Elsewhere mean your creditor's enemies might be willing to deal. You could trade one pact for another. One master for another. Out of the pot, into the fire. Early collection. If the entity decides you're more trouble than you're worth, it can call the debt due. All of it. At once. You don't survive that. But at least you're not in debt anymore. Evil Genie Escapes It does happen\u2014rarely\u2014that someone wriggles out through a loophole. A technicality. A desperate gambit the entity didn't anticipate. These cases become legends. They're also why entities have gotten very, very good at writing airtight terms over the millennia. If you think you've found a loophole, you probably haven't. The entity has seen your trick before. Usually from someone much smarter than you. The Summoning What Happens When You Call The entity arrives. Not from an anchor, not from a token\u2014it manifests . The transition is visible. Uncomfortable to witness. Air pressure changes Light bends wrong, casting shadows that don't match objects Temperature shifts\u2014sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes both in different parts of the room The smell of somewhere else. No one can describe it. Everyone recognizes it. The Relationship The entity isn't your servant. It's your contractor . It does what the pact specifies. If you negotiated well, that's a lot. If you didn't, it might technically fulfill the letter while violating the spirit. It knows every trick you know, and many you don't. Duration and power depend on pact terms and what you've paid recently. Use the connection sparingly, and you get modest manifestations. Burn through your remaining soul fast, and you can call forth something terrifying. The entity can refuse if you're asking for something outside the agreement. It can renegotiate. It can leave if the terms allow. You're not its master. You're its customer. There's a difference. What They Look Like It Varies Appearance depends on faction, individual nature, and possibly what your mind can process: Geometric : Wrong angles. Shapes that fold in directions that don't exist. Looking at them too long makes your eyes water. Almost biological : Too many limbs. Limbs that aren't limbs. A face close enough to human to be worse than something completely alien. Sensory rather than visual : A sound that has location. A pressure that has opinions. A smell that watches you. Changing : Different every time you see them. Or exactly the same, down to the shadow, no matter the lighting. Summoners in the same faction's service sometimes recognize each other's patrons. Like spotting a uniform. Or a brand. Contamination You're in Contact with the Outside You're not just paying with your core. The connection itself marks you. Manifestations Perception shifts : The boundary thins for you. You see cracks in reality where others see solid walls. Glimpses of Elsewhere bleeding through at odd moments. Dreams that aren't dreams. Resonance : Other entities notice you. You're marked as someone who deals. Some are curious. Some are hungry. Some are your patron's enemies, looking for leverage. Faction drift : Your patron's nature echoes in you. Not memories like Core Binding's bleed\u2014 tendencies . You start wanting what they want. Valuing what they value. The longer the pact, the more you serve their interests without being asked. The door : If you've given access as part of your terms, you're not always sure when it's open. Gaps in your memory. Actions you don't remember taking. The question of who's driving. The Consumed When Your Core Is Gone When a summoner's debt is fully collected: The body is still there. The soul is gone. What remains varies: A husk that breathes, blinks, maybe eats if you put food in its mouth. But nobody's home. Or something's moved in . The entity, or a piece of it, using the empty vessel. Looking out through human eyes. Or the body just stops. Heart keeps beating for a while, then doesn't. No violence, no unusual decay. Just vacancy, then nothing. Different factions leave different remains: - The Hungry leave bodies that look starved \u2014not thin, just emptied - The Mirrors leave bodies that don't move right anymore, like something's trying to remember how limbs work - The Absent leave bodies that are simply... gone. There one moment, not there the next. No one sees them leave. The Elsewhere Factions The entities aren't unified. They have allegiances, rivalries, territories. The politics are opaque to humans\u2014we catch glimpses. Wars referenced obliquely. Names spoken with something like fear. Requests that clearly serve some larger game. The full picture is never given. You're a pawn who doesn't know the board. The Accountants What They Want : Order Not justice. Not fairness. Ledgers that balance. Every debt paid. Every promise kept. Every exchange recorded. They invented the pact structure. The contract format. The terms and conditions. Other factions adopted their framework because it works. Characteristics They don't care what you do with the power. They care that the price is paid on time. Their summoners tend toward obsessive record-keeping. Counting things. Needing symmetry. Uncomfortable when anything is unbalanced. They might be the \"safest\" to deal with\u2014predictable, honorable in their way. But their honor is the honor of a loan shark. Miss a payment and they take what's owed, plus interest. What They're Really After Unknown. Possibly they're building something. A structure. A pattern. Every soul a brick in a wall no one can see. The Hungry What They Want : Sensation Our world is dense with feeling\u2014physical, emotional, experiential. The Elsewhere is thin. These entities are starving. Characteristics Pacts often include clauses about experiencing . The summoner has to feel things\u2014intensely\u2014and the entity feeds on it. Their summoners tend toward extremes. Thrill-seekers, hedonists, masochists. People who burn bright because something's drinking the flame. They're generous with power because they're getting paid in real-time. Every time you use the gift, you feel something, and they're right there, mouth open. What They're Really After More. Always more. They might not be collecting souls for any purpose beyond consumption. Just eating . And they're never full. The Architects What They Want : Change Specific changes. Moves in a game being played across centuries. They give orders that seem arbitrary\u2014stand here, say this, kill him, spare her\u2014and the pattern only becomes visible generations later. Characteristics Their summoners are pieces on a board. Useful, but not privy to the strategy. The contamination is subtle. You start thinking in long timelines. Personal goals feel small. You catch yourself making decisions that serve something larger, and you can't explain why. They might be at war with each other. Or cooperating on something vast. The summoner never knows which. What They're Really After The board to look a certain way. Our world reshaped. Not conquered\u2014 adjusted . Every soul they collect might be a piece removed from play. The Mirrors What They Want : Identity They're fascinated by selfhood\u2014the thing that makes you you and not someone else. They collect cores not as currency but as specimens. Art. Components of something they're building or becoming. Characteristics Pacts often include clauses about access . They want to wear you sometimes. See through your eyes. Make your choices. Not possession exactly\u2014more like borrowing. Their summoners have the worst contamination: identity bleed. Am I me? Was that my thought? When I wanted that, was it me wanting? They might be trying to become something. Using human cores as templates. Building a self out of stolen pieces. What They're Really After To be what we are. Or to understand it. Or to take it apart and see how it works. The souls they collect might be raw material for constructing something that can finally be . The Absent What They Want : Nothing That's what makes them terrifying. No demands, no hungers, no apparent agenda. They answer when called. They fulfill their terms. They collect what's owed. They never explain why. Characteristics Pacts with them are simple, clean, almost generous. Which makes experienced summoners deeply suspicious. Their summoners report the least contamination\u2014but also the least contact . The entity does the job and leaves. No presence, no pressure, no bleeding through. What They're Really After The only honest answer is \"we don't know.\" That might be the most dangerous answer of all. Faction Dynamics The Accountants vs. The Architects : Most friction. One wants every debt balanced now . The other lets ledgers run for centuries if it serves the plan. The Hungry : Looked down on by the others. Addicts. No sophistication. Just appetite . The Mirrors : Feared. What they're doing with the cores is wrong even by Elsewhere standards. The Absent : Make everyone nervous. You can't predict what you can't understand. What Happens to Collected Souls Unknown. Load-bearing mystery. Hints: - The Accountants file them. Somewhere. For something. - The Hungry consume them. Gone. Used up. Fuel. - The Architects place them. Pieces on a board. Maybe still aware. - The Mirrors wear them. Incorporate them. The entity you're dealing with might be partly made of collected cores. - The Absent : Nobody knows. Nobody's ever found out.

Every significant choice you'll face branches into potential futures. Potential yous . Fate Threading is the art of reaching into those branches and pulling. You grab a version of yourself from a choice you haven't made yet, drag them into the present, and make them real. The cost: that choice is gone. The path closes behind you. You will never become that person naturally\u2014you already extracted them. You're not mining your history. You're cannibalizing your becoming. The Core Rule Only Yourself. Only Forward. You can only pull versions of yourself from future fate-lines. No one else. Nothing from the past. No past-branch access. You decided not to become a soldier at eighteen. That soldier-you doesn't exist anymore. The choice was made. The branch collapsed. Only forward potential. You can pull from decisions you will face. The you that takes the job next month. The you that kills the man threatening your family tomorrow. The you that says yes to a proposal you haven't received yet. Always impacting your future. Every pull severs a path you could still walk. The web of your possibilities gets narrower with each extraction. The Mechanism Sensing Fate Threaders can feel their fate-web. Not clearly\u2014more like sensing pressure. Weight. Heavy futures: almost certain, highly probable, rich with consequence Light futures: unlikely, dependent on many contingencies, wispy Close futures: imminent choices, easy to grasp Distant futures: far-off possibilities, harder to reach Pulling You reach forward. Focus on a choice-point. Feel the version of yourself that exists down that path. And pull . The extraction isn't gentle. It feels like tearing something out of yourself\u2014because you are. That potential was part of you. Now it's standing next to you, a separate person. The Closure The path closes behind the pull. That choice-point is spent. When you reach that moment naturally\u2014the job offer, the marriage proposal, the crossroads\u2014the option you pulled from won't exist. You'll have to take a different path, or no path at all. What You Can Pull Any version of yourself that could exist based on choices you haven't made yet. Examples Tomorrow you face a duel. You can pull the you who wins\u2014skilled, confident, bloody-handed. (You cannot pull the you who dies. Dead futures contain nothing to extract.) Next year you might take a job with a merchant house. You can pull the you who spent a decade there, learned the trade, made the connections. But then you'll never be able to take that job naturally\u2014the future's already been harvested. You're considering marriage. You can pull the you who said yes, lived that life, raised those children. But if you pull the married-you, you've spent that future. You might still marry her, but it won't be the same. That fate-line is corrupted. What You Cannot Pull Past branches. You didn't become a soldier. That soldier doesn't exist. Gone forever. Dead futures. If a fate-line ends in your death, there's nothing to extract. Death isn't a version of you. It's the absence of you. Other people. Your fate-web contains connections to others, but you can't pull them . Only yourself. Selves from others' webs. Your brother's potential futures are his. Even if your fates are entangled, you can only pull from your own branches. The Brutal Math Youth Is Wealth Young threaders have wide webs. Lots of major choices ahead. Lots of potential selves to pull. Old threaders have narrow webs. Most choices are behind them. Most branches already collapsed through living, not pulling. The Narrowing A threader who pulls aggressively in youth might find themselves at forty with almost no remaining futures. They've spent their potential. What's left is a thin line leading to a handful of possible deaths\u2014and that's it. Every year you live, your web narrows naturally. Every pull accelerates that narrowing. The combination is a countdown. The Costs Aging Each pull costs years. Your body knows you're spending future. Hair grays. Joints ache. Skin thins. Heavy threaders look decades older than their actual age. The body is keeping score, even if the mind tries to ignore it. Coherence You're supposed to become those selves. That's how identity works\u2014you make choices, and you become the person who made them. When you rip them out prematurely, you become less. The sense of who you are gets foggy. Heavy threaders lose track of their own identity\u2014too many versions of themselves walking around, too many futures cashed out early. Some forget their own names. Not amnesia\u2014something stranger. They know they have a name. They just aren't sure which one is theirs and which one belongs to an extraction. Narrowing Web Every pull closes a path. The more you pull, the fewer futures remain. Eventually you're looking at a fate-web that's almost empty. Just the thin line of your remaining lifespan, no branches, no choices that matter, no potential left. This is visible to other threaders. A depleted fate-web looks like a dying tree\u2014sparse, brittle, few leaves. Anchoring Load The extracted selves are tethered to you. You're their origin point, and they need that connection to remain stable. While you live, they're coherent. Pull too many and your anchoring spreads thin. Neglected selves start to degrade\u2014memories corrupting, identity fragmenting. Soft cap: six to ten stable extractions, depending on the threader's strength. Push past that and they start going wrong. The Extracted Self They're you . From a choice you haven't made yet. What They Know They have your memories up to now\u2014the shared past you both lived. Then they have memories of the life they would have lived , down the fate-line you pulled them from. The soldier-you remembers the war you never fought. Knows the friends you never made, the enemies you never killed. The scholar-you remembers the books you never read. Knows the languages you never learned. They know things you don't. Skills you don't have. Experiences you skipped. What They Feel They're you. But they're also not you anymore. Loyal : They understand what you did, why you needed them. They're willing to help because you're the same person, fundamentally. Resentful : They had a life . It wasn't real yet, but it was going to be. You stole it. Collapsed their entire existence into serving the version that got to keep the body. Superior : The king-you looks at present-you and sees a lesser version. Unfinished. Unpolished. Why should he take orders from his own rough draft? Pitying : The happy-you, the peaceful-you, the one who got out\u2014they look at you and see someone still trapped in the mess they escaped. What They Can Do Anything you could do, if you'd made their choices. They have real skills, real knowledge, real capabilities. But they're not summoned tools. They're people . They make their own decisions, have their own opinions, pursue their own goals. You can ask them to help. You can try to convince them. You can't control them. Death of an Extracted Self When they die, that fate-line is destroyed. Not blocked\u2014 gone . You will never become that person. That potential is spent and destroyed. Whatever they knew, whatever they could do, is lost. The choice-point they came from? When you reach it naturally, it won't exist as an option anymore. You took it off the table by pulling and losing them. Implications Protecting your extractions matters. They're not disposable. Old threaders are cautious. They've lost extractions before. They know the cost. Suicide as weapon. An extraction that wants to hurt you can do it by dying. Kill themselves, and they take a piece of your future with them. Murder as fate-destruction. If someone kills your extractions, they're not just killing people\u2014they're unmaking your possibilities . Your Death If you die, your extracted selves drift. Memories corrupt over weeks or months Identity fragments. They forget their unlived lives. Eventually they become echoes. Walking, talking, but not coherent. Not quite people anymore. Some extracted selves will do anything to keep you alive. You're not just their origin\u2014you're their coherence. Without you, they dissolve. The Horror You're always eating your future. Every pull means: I will never become that person naturally. I will never walk that path. I will never make that choice and see where it leads. Young threaders have options. Old threaders have regrets. The oldest threaders\u2014the ones who pulled too much\u2014are ghosts before they die. No future left. Just the thin present moment, and the handful of selves they extracted before the well ran dry. And those selves? They know what you did. They know you spent their futures to get their skills, their knowledge, their help. Some forgive you. Some serve you. Some wait.

It has eaten the dead. It remembers what it consumed. When you summon, you fruit \u2014push the colony's biomass out of your body, shaped by the pattern of something it has previously decomposed. You are the garden. The dead are the seeds. What grows serves you\u2014mostly. The Colony What It Is A symbiotic fungal organism threaded through your body. Mycelium wrapped around your organs, woven into your muscles, nested in your gut. It's been there since infection\u2014possibly since birth, if your bloodline carries the strain. It's not intelligent. Not exactly. But it remembers . Chemically, structurally. Every dead thing it has ever broken down is stored as a pattern, a template, a set of instructions for reconstruction. How You Get One Three paths: Inheritance : Some bloodlines have carried colonies for generations. The fungus passes from parent to child\u2014in the womb, through nursing, through deliberate ritual feeding. These colonies are old, rich with patterns, heavy with the dead of your ancestors. Implantation : Deliberate infection. Consume a prepared culture. Inhale spores from an established host. Let someone cut you and pack the wound with living mycelium. The colony takes root over weeks\u2014painful weeks, as it learns your body and you learn its hunger. Wild infection : Rare and dangerous. Wild strains aren't adapted to human hosts. They might consume you instead of partnering. But they also haven't been domesticated, limited, bred for obedience. Wild hosts are unstable and powerful. The Relationship You and the colony aren't one being. You're partners\u2014sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing. Communication : Chemical, not verbal. You feel what it needs. Hunger. Satiation. Readiness. Reluctance. Over time you learn to interpret its states, and it learns yours. Negotiation : It wants to be fed. It wants to fruit. It wants to spread. Satisfy those drives and it cooperates fully. Deny them and it starts taking what it needs. Conflict : You can suppress the colony. Starve it, deny it, fight its urges. This is painful for both. Long-term suppression can damage the colony\u2014or you. Feeding the Colony The Core Rule The colony can only summon what it has consumed. No pattern, no summon. The Consumption Process Feed the colony dead things. Corpses, carcasses, any organic matter that was once alive. The colony breaks it down over hours to days, depending on size. A rat takes hours. A human takes days. A horse takes a week. During decomposition, the colony absorbs the pattern \u2014the biological blueprint. The physical matter is processed into nutrients. You benefit from this. Hosts who feed their colonies regularly need less food otherwise. What You Can Feed It Animals : Common, easy, socially acceptable (mostly). A well-maintained colony has consumed dozens of creatures. Humans : Richer patterns, more useful for complex summons. Also murder, or at minimum corpse acquisition. Other hosts : A colony that consumes another colony gains its patterns. This is how strains merge, compete, and evolve. It's also how wars between hosts end. Parts : You don't need the whole thing. A hand gives you a hand-pattern. A heart gives you a heart. Useful for specialists. Storage Limits The colony can only hold so many patterns clearly. Old patterns degrade. Recent consumption (weeks): clear patterns, high-fidelity summons Older consumption (months): degraded patterns, approximate summons Ancient consumption (years): fragmentary patterns, partial summons Hosts who want to keep a pattern fresh have to re-feed periodically. Kill another one of the same thing. Refresh the template. The Summoning (Fruiting) The Process You call a pattern. Will it, focus on it, reach into the colony's memory. The colony responds\u2014if willing, if it has the pattern, if you have the biomass. Fruiting begins. Mycelium pushes outward through skin, mouth, wounds. Uncomfortable to agonizing depending on size. The biomass shapes itself according to the stored pattern. The summon separates. Stands, moves, exists as an independent organism\u2014connected to you, but physically distinct. What Comes Out A fungal reconstruction of whatever the colony consumed. Shape of the original. Structure. Proportions. Approximate capabilities. A summoned wolf can run and bite. A summoned soldier can fight. No original mind. The colony's impression of behavior, filtered through chemical memory. Looks wrong . Fibrous flesh. Pale or mottled coloring. No blood\u2014cut it and it leaks clear fluid. Faces that approximate features without achieving them. The Tether The summon remains connected. You sense what it senses, dimly. It follows your intentions, mostly. Colony drives lurk underneath. Distance matters. Close summons are responsive. Distant ones get autonomous. Severed tether doesn't vanish the summon\u2014it just stops being yours . The Costs Biomass The summon is made from you . Small summons: a meal's worth. Hungry, lightheaded afterward. Medium summons: several meals. Gaunt, shaky. Large summons: dangerous. Pulling from muscle, reserves, things you need. Multiple summons: multiplicative cost. Recovery After dismissing or reabsorbing: Eating. A lot. Protein, fat, minerals. Time. Days for large summons. The colony's cut. Not everything comes back. Long-term summoners are lighter than they should be. The Colony's Demands When it's not satisfied: Hunger : Craving dead things. Compulsion to seek corpses. Fruiting pressure : The need to externalize. Suppress too long and it might fruit involuntarily. Spread drive : The colony wants new hosts. You start noticing people as candidates . Reabsorption and Dismissal Reabsorption Pull the biomass back in. Reverse fruiting. Recovers some of what you spent. Uncomfortable. Something crawling back inside. Takes time. Minutes to longer. Damaged summons bring damage back with them. Decomposition If you won't reabsorb: Fast breakdown. Hours. Messy. Collapses into fungal matter. Wasteful. No biomass recovery. Abandonment Leave a summon active indefinitely: It feeds itself. Hunting, scavenging. It might grow. Add biomass. It might reproduce. Spread spores. It stops being yours. Feral. What Hosts Look Like Physical Signs Pale or grayish undertone. Mycelium shows through. Faint patterning visible in certain light. Run cool. The colony takes heat. Smell of loam, petrichor, hint of decay. Eyes develop cloudiness over time. Behavioral Signs Constant eating. Protein and fat. Stay thin despite it. Drawn to dead things. Notice corpses. Have to resist acquiring. Touch people differently. Assessing. The colony is interested in new hosts. The Old Ones Decades of hosting: More mycelium than meat. Don't think quite like humans. Colony priorities seeped in. Some stop being human-shaped between summonings. Framework for fruiting.

How Practitioners View Each Other Core Binding Flesh Shaping Pact Summoning Fate Threading Colony Summoning Core Binders think... \u2014 \"Butchers playing with meat\" \"Fools selling themselves\" \"Clever but limited\" \"Disgusting parasites\" Flesh Shapers think... \"Sentimental prisoners\" \u2014 \"Cheaters who buy power\" \"Interesting but impractical\" \"Similar work, cruder method\" Pact Summoners think... \"Small ambitions\" \"Too much work\" \u2014 \"Eating themselves\" \"At least they chose it\" Fate Threaders think... \"Dependent on others' deaths\" \"Limited by skill\" \"Mortgaged to outsiders\" \u2014 \"Gave up their body\" Colony Hosts think... \"We both use the dead\" \"Professional kinship\" \"Dangerous deals\" \"Lonely method\" \u2014 Can Systems Combine? Core Binding + Pact Summoning If a pact summoner dies, is there a core to harvest? Depends on how much is left. A summoner who's been paying for decades might leave a core so thin it's barely usable. Or nothing at all. Duds\u2014empty, immediately gone upon death. Or the core is pulled to the Elsewhere. Something happens to it there. This might be the thing we don't understand. Flesh Shaping + Pact Summoning Could you spark a homunculus with a pact summoner's diminished core? What would that create? Would the entity still have a claim? Elsewhere Entities + Core Binding The entities have no cores. They're from outside. The rules of death here don't apply. You can't bind one. Can't harvest one. They're outside the economy that governs everything else. That's part of why they're dangerous. Fate Threading + Other Arts Can you pull a version of yourself that practiced a different Art? Yes. And they'd come with the knowledge and corruption of that practice. The Flesh Shaper-you is pale and hungry. The Core Binder-you has echoes bleeding into them. The Pact Summoner-you might still owe something to an entity. Colony + Core Binding Can a colony consume a practitioner and gain something from their practice? Unknown. Colonies gain patterns, not abilities. But a Flesh Shaper's pattern might include something about blood-affinity. A Core Binder's pattern might include traces of their echoes. The interactions haven't been thoroughly explored. They're dangerous to test. The Universal Truth Every Art in H\u00e1lcova operates on the same principle: You must spend something real to gain something real. The currency varies: - The dead and your sense of self (Core Binding) - Blood and your humanity (Flesh Shaping) - Your soul in installments (Pact Summoning) - Your future possibilities (Fate Threading) - Your body and autonomy (Colony Summoning) But the transaction is always the same.

Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental.

Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't. That's the relationship.","title":"Fundamental Principle"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#the-core","text":"What It Is The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete - Deaths in old age after long decline","title":"The Core"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#anchors","text":"Physical Form A core needs a home. The anchor is a physical object that houses the bound echo\u2014a prison dressed as a portrait. Anchors can take many forms: - Carved figurines or statuettes - Painted tiles or tablets - Etched metal plates - Clay tablets with pressed images - Bone carvings - Jewelry settings - Decorated containers The anchor must depict the bound echo. This can happen two ways: Natural manifestation : The anchor changes when a core is bound to it, the image of the echo appearing on or in the material as if etched by invisible hands. Artistic creation : The binder creates the depiction deliberately, crafting an image of the creature to be bound before or during the binding process. Looking at a binder's collection tells you who they carry. The echoes watch out from their prisons, rendered in whatever medium houses them. Carrying Capacity A binder can carry as many anchors as they can physically transport.

The Bottleneck Multiple simultaneous activations create problems: Resonance interference : Too many active echoes at once causes bleeding between them. Their memories mix. Their identities blur. Two echoes might start sharing the same thought, speaking in unison, losing track of which one is which. Physical drain : Every active echo taxes the binder. The more echoes active, the greater the exhaustion. Running too many is like holding your breath\u2014eventually something gives. The limit is personal. Some binders can run four echoes comfortably. Others struggle with two. Veterans know their limit exactly.

They need fuel\u2014a consumable resource that keeps them coherent and stable. What It Does The resource feeds the anchor, which feeds the echo. Without regular doses: - The echo becomes confused - Memories fragment and scramble - Identity degrades - Eventually, what you summon isn't what you bound\u2014it's a broken thing that used to be a person Resource Economy The resource creates an entire economy: - Harvesters who collect it from sources - Refiners who process it into usable form - Merchants who trade it - Smugglers who move it illegally - Black markets for rare or potent variants Consumption Rates Simple echoes (animals, simple minds): low consumption Complex echoes (humans, intelligent creatures): moderate consumption Powerful or traumatic echoes: high consumption Echoes that have become aware : highest consumption An echo that realizes it's dead burns through resources faster. The awareness creates strain\u2014the echo fighting against its condition, the anchor struggling to contain something that wants out. Aware echoes require constant upkeep and intensive focus. Quality Matters The resource can be: - Adulterated (stretched with fillers\u2014causes instability) - Counterfeited (fake\u2014causes degradation) - Aged (loses potency over time) - Fresh (most effective, most expensive) Experienced binders can assess quality by look, smell, even taste. They know when they're being cheated. They know when the resource is good enough to maintain a difficult echo, or only good enough for simple ones. Scarcity as Plot Peace is expensive for binders. Whatever the resource turns out to be, it's easier to acquire during times of mass death\u2014wars, plagues, disasters. Stability means scarcity.

You flinch at dogs, and you've never had a bad experience with dogs\u2014but one of your echoes did. Memory intrusion : Flashes of their life. A spouse's face you've never seen.

Mycelium wrapped around your organs, woven into your muscles, nested in your gut. It's been there since infection\u2014possibly since birth, if your bloodline carries the strain. It's not intelligent. Not exactly. But it remembers . Chemically, structurally. Every dead thing it has ever broken down is stored as a pattern, a template, a set of instructions for reconstruction. How You Get One Three paths: Inheritance : Some bloodlines have carried colonies for generations. The fungus passes from parent to child\u2014in the womb, through nursing, through deliberate ritual feeding. These colonies are old, rich with patterns, heavy with the dead of your ancestors. Implantation : Deliberate infection. Consume a prepared culture. Inhale spores from an established host. Let someone cut you and pack the wound with living mycelium. The colony takes root over weeks\u2014painful weeks, as it learns your body and you learn its hunger. Wild infection : Rare and dangerous. Wild strains aren't adapted to human hosts. They might consume you instead of partnering. But they also haven't been domesticated, limited, bred for obedience. Wild hosts are unstable and powerful. The Relationship You and the colony aren't one being. You're partners\u2014sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing. Communication : Chemical, not verbal. You feel what it needs. Hunger. Satiation. Readiness. Reluctance. Over time you learn to interpret its states, and it learns yours. Negotiation : It wants to be fed. It wants to fruit. It wants to spread. Satisfy those drives and it cooperates fully. Deny them and it starts taking what it needs. Conflict : You can suppress the colony. Starve it, deny it, fight its urges. This is painful for both. Long-term suppression can damage the colony\u2014or you.","title":"The Colony"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#feeding-the-colony","text":"The Core Rule The colony can only summon what it has consumed. No pattern, no summon. The Consumption Process Feed the colony dead things. Corpses, carcasses, any organic matter that was once alive. The colony breaks it down over hours to days, depending on size. A rat takes hours. A human takes days. A horse takes a week. During decomposition, the colony absorbs the pattern \u2014the biological blueprint. The physical matter is processed into nutrients. You benefit from this. Hosts who feed their colonies regularly need less food otherwise. What You Can Feed It Animals : Common, easy, socially acceptable (mostly). A well-maintained colony has consumed dozens of creatures. Humans : Richer patterns, more useful for complex summons. Also murder, or at minimum corpse acquisition. Other hosts : A colony that consumes another colony gains its patterns. This is how strains merge, compete, and evolve. It's also how wars between hosts end. Parts : You don't need the whole thing. A hand gives you a hand-pattern. A heart gives you a heart. Useful for specialists. Storage Limits The colony can only hold so many patterns clearly. Old patterns degrade. Recent consumption (weeks): clear patterns, high-fidelity summons Older consumption (months): degraded patterns, approximate summons Ancient consumption (years): fragmentary patterns, partial summons Hosts who want to keep a pattern fresh have to re-feed periodically.

These range from applied sciences to dark practices to institutional technologies. All operate within the economic-psychological framework that defines reality here. Behavioral Alchemy Core Mechanism Systematically manipulating incentive structures to produce predictable behavioral outcomes. Nature This is not magic in the traditional sense. It's applied economics. But in H\u00e1lcova, where economic principles are metaphysically real, sophisticated incentive design can produce effects that look like magic. Practices Market Architecture Creating transaction structures that align self-interest with desired outcomes. A skilled architect can design situations where people choose what you want them to choose without coercion or deception. Example : Structuring a labor contract so that the worker's best response to every contingency is the response you want. They're not forced\u2014they're incentivized. They don't resent you\u2014they thank you for the opportunity. Commitment Devices Binding future-you to current-you's preferences. Pattern-enforceable contracts. Reputation systems that make defection visible. Example : \"You must do this, and you will want to, because the alternative is structured to be worse.\" The subject creates their own prison and holds their own key\u2014but never wants to use it. Information Management Controlling what's known, by whom, when. Creating asymmetries that advantage you. Revealing information strategically to shape decisions. Example : Letting someone \"discover\" information you planted, so they believe they have an advantage when they're actually playing your game. Why This Is Dangerous Behavioral alchemy works on anyone . Pacts require consent. Binding requires death. Flesh shaping requires material. Fate Threading only works on yourself. But behavioral alchemy just requires understanding incentives\u2014and everyone has incentives. Practitioners Merchant houses specializing in contract design Loom-adjacent institutions managing information flow Political operatives structuring choices Criminal organizations manipulating markets Cost No inherent magical cost\u2014this is skill, not Art. But: - Sophisticated targets recognize manipulation attempts - Failed manipulation creates enemies - Reputation effects limit repeated use - The Loom may predict your manipulation (information asymmetry cuts both ways) Residue Engineering Core Mechanism Processing Pattern Residue into useful forms beyond simple heat release. Categories Refined Residue (Fuel Grade) Standard processed Residue for furnaces and heat. Removes impurities, standardizes energy content. The coal of H\u00e1lcova. Properties : Burns steadily, predictable output, minimal side effects Applications : Heating, cooking, basic industry Trade Value : Base commodity, high volume, moderate margins Crystallized Residue (Storage Grade) Residue processed into stable solid form. Stores energy for extended periods. Properties : Compact, stable, long shelf life, requires activation to release Applications : Portable power, batteries, emergency reserves, wealth storage Trade Value : Premium commodity, lower volume, high margins Liquid Residue (Transfer Grade) Residue in suspension, movable through pipes and channels. Properties : Flows, can be pressurized, enables distributed systems Applications : City heating networks, industrial processes, magitech fluid systems Trade Value : Infrastructure commodity, requires delivery systems Residue Circuits (Information Grade) Processed to carry pattern-information rather than just heat. Properties : Can store and transmit pattern-data, interfaces with Loom-engines Applications : Loom nodes, communication systems, calculation devices Trade Value : Specialty commodity, highly regulated, enormous margins Residue Weapons (Destruction Grade) Processed for rapid energy release. Properties : Burns hotter than normal, hard to extinguish, damages pattern-integrity of living targets Applications : Military, execution, industrial destruction Trade Value : Restricted commodity, black market premium The Refinement Problem Processing Residue requires: - Heat (often from burning cruder Residue) - Alchemical catalysts - Specialized equipment - Skilled labor - Time Higher grades are more valuable but costlier to produce. This creates: - Vertical integration (controlling harvest through refinement) - Arbitrage opportunities (buy crude, sell refined) - Quality certification problems (how do you verify grade?) - Black markets (unregulated refinement, stolen Residue) Pattern Interference Core Mechanism Directly manipulating someone's S\u00f3rscad without their consent. Status Possibly mythical. Possibly real and hidden. The uncertainty is deliberate. Theory The Loom reads patterns. But reading requires interaction. The Loom-engines that read patterns could theoretically write to them. This is: - Heretical (patterns are sacred) - Dangerous (pattern corruption can cascade) - Possibly impossible (maybe the Loom only reads) - Possibly already happening (maybe someone has write access) Theoretical Methods Overlay Adding elements to someone's pattern without removing originals. Creating new layers that interfere with prediction. Making someone \"illegible.\" Hypothetical Effect : Target becomes unpredictable. Loom readings return noise. Wardens can't track them. Hypothetical Cost : The overlay may be unstable. The pattern may reject it. The subject may experience cognitive fragmentation. Erasure Removing pattern elements. Destroying parts of someone's fate. Hypothetical Effect : Target loses aspects of themselves. Memories, capabilities, personality traits associated with erased elements. Hypothetical Cost : What happens to someone with incomplete pattern? Do they still exist? Are they still human? Substitution Replacing one pattern element with another. Changing someone's predicted trajectory. Hypothetical Effect : Target's fate changes. Or does it? Does this change their actual future or just the prediction? Hypothetical Cost : The substituted element came from somewhere. Someone else's pattern was harvested. Merger Combining patterns from multiple people. Creating composite fates. Hypothetical Effect : Hybrid individuals. Shared destinies. The basis of certain binding practices\u2014and possibly the origin of the Colony symbiosis. Hypothetical Cost : Which identity survives? Whose pattern dominates? What happens when merged patterns conflict? Why It's Not Widespread If possible : - The Warden Order hunts practitioners with extreme prejudice - Pattern integrity is economically valued (damaged patterns = unemployable) - The Attendance may resist (or may enable for its own reasons) - Effects are unpredictable If impossible : - Rumors persist for social/political reasons - Provides convenient explanation for unexpected outcomes - Keeps the Warden Order necessary - Justifies Loom authority The Horror Nobody knows which situation is true. The uncertainty itself shapes behavior. Echo Architecture Core Mechanism Creating structures of echoes that interact, beyond simple single-echo binding. Practices Echo Networks Multiple bound echoes coordinated for shared purpose. Example : A research institution binds generations of scholars, creating a persistent intellectual tradition that survives individual death. New researchers can query the network. The network accumulates knowledge. Problem : Network consensus may ossify. The dead outvote the living. Innovation becomes heresy. Echo Hierarchies Binding the echo of someone who was themselves a binder. Creating chains of reference. Example : You bind a master binder's echo. That echo knows how to bind, and remembers their own echoes. You gain access to a lineage of knowledge\u2014the original person's knowledge, plus their echo's knowledge, plus their echo's echo's knowledge. Problem : Hierarchies degrade. Each level is a copy of a copy. The deepest echoes are unreliable. But which level do you trust? Echo Consensus Using multiple echoes' perspectives to approximate truth. Example : If three independent echoes agree on a fact, it's probably accurate. Courts use majority-of-echoes testimony for historical disputes. Institutions use echo consensus for decisions that outlive any individual. Problem : Echoes can be wrong in the same ways. If all three witnesses to an event believed the same lie, their echoes will repeat it. Consensus isn't truth. The Degradation Problem Echoes degrade over time: - Memory becomes selective - Personality becomes caricature - Knowledge becomes outdated - Connection becomes strain Echo architectures must manage: - Redundancy (multiple echoes with overlapping knowledge) - Refresh (binding new echoes to replace degraded ones) - Integration (new echoes must be compatible with existing network) Emergent Properties Long-standing echo institutions develop emergent properties. The network of echoes may develop goals that none of the individual echoes hold. Institutional will arising from pattern-interaction between the bound dead. Some institutions: - Have been running for centuries - Have thousands of echoes integrated - Display collective behavior no one designed - May no longer serve their original purpose - May not be controllable by the living Colony Engineering Core Mechanism Deliberately shaping colonies for specific purposes, beyond simple hosting. Practices Strain Development Cultivating colony variants with desired properties. Goals : - Warmth without aggression - Integration without identity loss - Fruiting without corpse-feeding - Enhanced strength without transformation Methods : - Selective cultivation over generations - Controlled feeding (what you feed a colony shapes what it becomes) - Environmental manipulation (temperature, humidity, Residue concentration) - Hybridization between strains Architectural Integration Building colonies into structures. Applications : - Walls that regulate temperature - Foundations that process waste - Buildings that grow and repair - Structures that respond to inhabitant needs Problems : - Integrated colonies still want to spread - Structures may develop preferences - Maintenance requires feeding - Removal is destructive Medical Application Controlled colony hosting for therapeutic purposes. Applications : - Colonies that eat tumors - Colonies that enhance healing - Colonies that regulate body chemistry - Colonies that extend life Problems : - Therapeutic colonies still integrate - \"Controlled\" is relative - Long-term effects unknown - Patients may prefer the colony to their original state The Dependency Problem Colonies want to spread. Engineering them for specific purposes: - Constrains their natural drives - Requires ongoing intervention - Creates escape risks (what if the engineered strain gets out?) - May produce backlash (colonies resisting modification) The Vent Lands Specialty Geothermal conditions favor colony cultivation: - Stable warmth year-round - Diverse fungal biodiversity - Experimental traditions - Distance from Orthodox suppression The Vent Lands' colony engineering is the most advanced, most dangerous, and most commercially valuable on H\u00e1lcova. They export: - Engineered strains - Cultivation expertise - Architectural colonies - Medical hosting services They keep for themselves: - The most advanced strains - Military applications - The oldest, most integrated structures - Whatever they're really doing in the deep thermal zones Prediction Markets Core Mechanism Markets that aggregate information about future events through price discovery. Function The Loom predicts, but its predictions aren't publicly available in real-time. Prediction markets fill the gap: - Anyone can bet on future outcomes - Prices reflect aggregate expectations - Profit incentivizes accurate information - Markets may outperform Loom-predictions (aggregating distributed knowledge) Market Types Event Markets Will X happen by date Y?

The Tensions Market vs. Loom When prediction markets diverge from Loom-predictions, which is correct? - Markets aggregate current information; Loom sees pattern-determined trajectories - Divergence might indicate: Loom error, market manipulation, fundamental uncertainty, or impending deviation Self-Fulfilling Prophecy Prices affect behavior. If the market predicts a business fails, investors flee, causing failure. The prediction market creates the outcome it predicts\u2014but differently than the Loom does. Information Arbitrage Those with Loom-access can trade on privileged information. Those without access are disadvantaged. The market is structurally unfair\u2014but may still be informative. The Horror Markets that predict deaths. Markets that predict pattern changes. Markets that predict deviations. The financial incentive to be right about tragedy. Some traders: - Profit from disasters they predicted - May have caused the disasters they predicted - Can't be distinguished from lucky vs. criminal - Create incentives for information that shouldn't exist Magitech Integration How Residue Powers Technology Basic Principle Pattern Residue stores energy. Releasing that energy can do work. The engineering challenge is controlling the release. Control Mechanisms Throttling : Restricting flow rate of Residue to the release point. More Residue = more power, but also more heat, more waste, more danger. Catalysis : Using alchemical compounds to lower the activation energy for release. Different catalysts produce different release profiles (fast, slow, sustained, pulsed). Circuitry : Channeling released energy through constructed pathways. Residue circuits can direct energy to specific functions. Feedback : Systems that adjust Residue flow based on output. Primitive automation.

Residue is efficient storage, not creation. No Pattern Creation Magitech can read, store, and transmit pattern information. It cannot create genuine patterns. Homunculi remain pattern-less. Artificial life is not achievable through engineering. No Elsewhere Protection Magitech doesn't inherently protect against Elsewhere influence. During K\u00f6d, devices may malfunction.

H\u00e1lcova is an economy. The metaphysical substrate of reality operates on the same principles that govern markets, decisions, and resource allocation. This isn't metaphor\u2014it's the literal structure of how existence functions here. Physics has transaction costs. Identity is a balance sheet. Time is currency with variable exchange rates. Death is a market event. The Elsewhere is a competing market. Economic Principles Made Literal 1. Opportunity Cost (Fate Threading) The Principle : Every choice forecloses alternatives. The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take. How It Manifests : When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're harvesting the opportunity cost itself . The future they didn't choose had value\u2014stored potential\u2014and they're cashing it out. But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to you . When you harvest one: - Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path - Permanently close that path (it's been spent) - Reduce your total remaining \"decision space\" The Horror : Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic\u2014not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives. The Economic Parallel : This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. H\u00e1lcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit. 2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding) The Principle : People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered. How It Manifests : Core Binding creates echoes\u2014remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding. The fallacy manifests when: - The echo becomes corrupted or hostile - The echo's information becomes outdated - The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: \"I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment.\" The Horror : Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds. The Structural Element : The magic system rewards sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful\u2014if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy. 3. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning) The Principle : When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks. How It Manifests : Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard: - You get the power - Someone else pays the price - Your incentive to be cautious evaporates The Structure : First-level hazard : You make a pact, knowing you can transfer costs to others. You take risks you wouldn't if you had to pay personally. Second-level hazard : Entities know this. They design pacts that encourage substitution because substitution feeds them more souls than cautious single-source extraction would. Third-level hazard : Society knows substitution is possible. This creates: - A market for \"willing\" substitutes (debt bondage, religious sacrifice, criminal punishment) - Insurance-like structures where groups pool substitution risk - Political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses The Horror : The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption. Every structural incentive pushes toward finding more people to substitute. The pact-maker who started trying to save their child from illness ends up feeding strangers to the entity because the entity structured the deal to encourage exactly that progression. The Real-World Parallel : This is how moral hazard works in finance, insurance, environmental policy. H\u00e1lcova just makes the externalized cost viscerally visible (your soul being eaten) rather than abstractly distributed (future generations, distant populations, statistical victims). 4. Asymmetric Information (The Loom) The Principle : When one party in a transaction knows more than the other, the informed party can exploit the uninformed. How It Manifests : The Loom knows your pattern. You know only fragments of it. This asymmetry is structural and deliberate. The Layers : Layer 1 - Basic Prediction : - The Loom predicts your behavior better than you can predict yourself - This information is sold (to employers, lenders, spouses) - You're priced based on knowledge you don't have access to Layer 2 - Self-Fulfilling Prophecy : - Predictions affect how people treat you - Being treated as \"likely to fail\" makes failure more likely - The Loom's information advantage compounds over time Layer 3 - The Attendance : - Whatever answers Loom queries may have its own agenda - It may provide accurate predictions that serve that agenda - It may withhold predictions that don't - Users can't verify which is happening The Horror : You can never know if your life outcomes are: - Genuine fate (the pattern is real) - Self-fulfilling prophecy (the prediction created the outcome) - Manipulation (the Attendance shaped events to match its predictions) - Statistical noise (you're the outlier the Loom got wrong, and nobody will believe you) The Economic Parallel : This is the information problem in credit scoring, insurance underwriting, hiring algorithms. The scored can't see the model, can't verify its accuracy for their case, and can't escape the consequences of its predictions. 5. Principal-Agent Problem (The Warden Order) The Principle : When one party (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal), their interests may diverge. The agent may serve their own interests while claiming to serve the principal's. How It Manifests : The Warden Order ostensibly serves: - The Weaver (divine principal, if real) - Society (collective principal) - The individual's \"true pattern\" (metaphysical principal) But Wardens are: - Humans with personal interests - Politically embedded in power structures - Economically dependent on the Residue system - Psychologically shaped by their Attunement The Divergences : The Order claims to enforce pattern compliance for spiritual/cosmic reasons. But: - Enforcement generates Residue (executions produce fuel) - Deviants threaten power structures that benefit the Order - The Attunement itself may be a form of control (Wardens can't deviate, so they enforce anti-deviation) The Horror : Wardens genuinely believe they serve higher purposes. The Attunement makes doubt physically painful. But the structure of their situation means their interests align with enforcement regardless of whether enforcement serves the principals they claim. Is a given Warden: - Righteous servant of cosmic order? - Unwitting tool of institutional self-interest? - Victim of their own Attunement's compulsions? - All three simultaneously? The Real-World Parallel : Every institution with enforcement power faces this. Police, regulators, religious authorities. The agents' interests inevitably diverge from the principals'. H\u00e1lcova makes the mechanism explicit and the self-deception visible. 6. Externalities (Pattern Residue Economy) The Principle : Externalities are costs or benefits that affect parties not directly involved in a transaction. How It Manifests : Every death releases Pattern Residue that: - Benefits: Residue harvesters, fuel consumers, magitech users - Costs: The environment (cooling), the deceased, anyone who valued the deceased The externalities are massive and structural: - War benefits Residue producers (positive externality for them) - War's dead bear the cost (negative externality for them) - The cooling affects everyone (diffuse negative externality) The Feedback Loop : Because externalities aren't priced into decisions: - War is underpriced (the benefits are captured; the costs are externalized) - Peace is overpriced (the costs are borne; the benefits diffuse) - The system optimizes for death-producing activities The Horror : This isn't evil people making evil choices. It's rational actors responding to incentive structures. The merchant who profits from Residue trade isn't a monster\u2014they're responding to prices that don't include the full cost of death. The general who extends a war isn't bloodthirsty\u2014they're responding to institutional pressures that reward Residue production. The Real-World Parallel : Carbon emissions, industrial pollution, financial contagion. The structure is identical: privatized benefits, socialized costs, and rational actors who aren't individually to blame but collectively produce catastrophe. 7. Hyperbolic Discounting (Colony Hosting) The Principle : People systematically overvalue immediate rewards relative to future costs, and this bias is predictable. How It Manifests : Colony hosting offers immediate benefits: - Warmth (colonies generate heat) - Strength (biomass integration) - Connection (to the colony network) - Belonging (to something larger) The costs are distant: - Identity erosion (gradual) - Autonomy loss (incremental) - Physical transformation (slow) - Ultimate absorption (far future) The Structure : The colony doesn't force anything. It offers: - Day 1: Warmth when you're freezing - Day 30: A little more warmth, barely noticeable integration - Day 365: You can't imagine being cold again; the integration feels natural - Day 3650: You're not sure where you end and the colony begins; you don't want to know The Horror : At every decision point, the immediate benefit exceeds the immediate cost. There's no moment where the person makes a clearly bad choice. Each step is marginally rational. The aggregate is catastrophic. The Real-World Parallel : Addiction, debt accumulation, relationship deterioration. The mechanism is hyperbolic discounting: we know the future cost but discount it too heavily. The colony just makes the curve visible. Game Theory Made Literal 8. Prisoner's Dilemma (The Substitution Market) The Principle : Individually rational choices can produce collectively irrational outcomes. How It Manifests : Consider two potential pact-substitutes who could coordinate: - If both refuse: The pact-maker can't find substitutes; they bear their own costs; the substitutes live - If one refuses, one accepts: The acceptor dies; the refuser lives with guilt but lives - If both accept: Both might die (entity takes both) or might compete for \"better\" terms The Structure : Entities deliberately create these dynamics: - Multiple people offered substitution deals - Deals structured so accepting is individually rational even though coordinated refusal would be collectively better - Information asymmetry prevents coordination (you don't know who else was offered) The Horror : The substitute who accepts isn't a victim\u2014they made a choice. The substitute who refuses isn't a hero\u2014they just shifted probability to someone else. Everyone is both perpetrator and victim. The entity harvests not just souls but the coordination failure itself. The Broader Pattern : This applies to: - Workers undercutting each other for Residue-industry jobs - Nations in security dilemmas over Residue reserves - Families with members at different pattern-ratings competing for resources 9. Tragedy of the Commons (Residue Harvesting) The Principle : Shared resources are overexploited when individual incentives diverge from collective interest. How It Manifests : Pattern Residue in the environment is a common resource: - Anyone can harvest ambient Residue - Harvesting depletes local concentration - Depletion affects everyone in the area - But the harvester captures the full value of what they take The Structure : In frontier regions : - Prospectors race to harvest - Early harvesters get the richest deposits - Later arrivals find depleted areas - The rush depletes faster than sustainable In cities : - Multiple institutions compete for Residue access - Each has incentive to harvest more than sustainable - Collective action to limit harvesting is unstable (defection is rewarded) - Result: Cities depend on imported Residue (from death elsewhere) The Horror : The death-producing industries exist because cities depleted their local Residue commons. The solution to the tragedy is importing the tragedy\u2014making death happen somewhere else, out of sight, so the commons can stabilize locally. The Real-World Parallel : Fisheries, groundwater, atmosphere. H\u00e1lcova just makes the \"somewhere else\" visible and the imported cost explicit (it's bodies). 10. Mechanism Design (The Loom as Engineered System) The Principle : Institutions can be designed to align individual incentives with desired collective outcomes. But the designer's goals may not be the participants' goals. How It Manifests : Someone designed The Loom. It's a mechanism that: - Elicits information (pattern readings) - Provides incentives (prediction access) - Structures interactions (the S\u00f3rscad system) - Produces outcomes (fate compliance, Residue production, social order) The Questions : Who designed it? What were their goals? - If divine: Goals are unknowable but presumably good - If ancient civilization: Goals may be irrelevant now (different context) - If Elsewhere: Goals may be hostile or alien - If emergent: No designer; outcomes are accidental equilibrium Is the mechanism working as designed? - Maybe it worked once and broke - Maybe it's working perfectly (and the horror is intentional) - Maybe it was hijacked (Elsewhere entities captured the system) - Maybe it never worked (the designers failed and we're in the failure state) The Horror : We're inside a designed system. We can't see the design. We can't know the designer's intent. We can't tell if it's functioning or broken. Every interaction with the Loom is participation in someone else's mechanism. The Real-World Parallel : Markets, legal systems, platforms. We interact with designed mechanisms daily. We rarely know the designers' full intent. We can't easily tell if outcomes are features or bugs. Psychological Principles Made Literal 11. Cognitive Dissonance (Warden Attunement) The Principle : When actions conflict with beliefs, people adjust beliefs rather than admitting the actions were wrong. How It Manifests : The Attunement process: - Wardens undergo painful initiation - They sacrifice personal autonomy (pattern-lock) - They commit to enforcement (including lethal) - They gain abilities and status Cognitive dissonance predicts: - The more sacrifice, the stronger the belief in the cause - Wardens who execute more will believe more strongly in necessity - Doubts will be experienced as weakness (not information) The Structure : The Attunement is designed to maximize dissonance: - High entry cost \u2192 Strong commitment - Visible sacrifice (lifespan) \u2192 Justification pressure - Enforcement actions \u2192 Belief intensification - Doubt = physical pain \u2192 Doubt suppression The Horror : Wardens aren't brainwashed. They've rationalized themselves into true belief through the normal process of dissonance reduction. The cruelest thing: the mechanism is visible. Wardens can learn about cognitive dissonance. Knowing doesn't help. The Attunement has already shaped their ability to doubt. 12. Prospect Theory (Pattern Gambling) The Principle : People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains, and are risk-seeking when facing losses, risk-averse when facing gains. How It Manifests : Pattern-prediction creates reference points: - Your predicted trajectory becomes your baseline - Outcomes better than predicted feel like gains - Outcomes worse than predicted feel like losses - The prediction creates the reference, which determines the emotional weight The Implications : Someone with a \"bad\" pattern who slightly outperforms it feels neutral or mildly positive. Someone with a \"good\" pattern who slightly underperforms feels devastated. This drives: - Pattern-constrained risk-taking : \"I'm predicted to fail anyway; might as well gamble\" - Pattern-privileged conservatism : \"I have too much to lose; better play safe\" - Pattern fraud : Manipulating predictions to change the reference point - K\u00f6d-timing : Making major decisions during the fifth season when patterns are disrupted The Horror : The Loom doesn't just predict. By predicting, it creates the reference points that shape how people experience outcomes. The prediction changes reality by changing how people feel about reality. 13. Fundamental Attribution Error (Pattern Essentialism) The Principle : People attribute others' behavior to character while attributing their own behavior to circumstances. How It Manifests : The S\u00f3rscad system provides: - Stable, readable \"character\" attributes - Official confirmation of what someone \"is\" - Prediction-based expectations This amplifies attribution error: - Others' failures: \"Their pattern predicted this; it's who they are\" - Own failures: \"Circumstances; bad luck; the prediction didn't account for context\" - Others' successes: \"Their pattern set them up; anyone would succeed with that S\u00f3rscad\" - Own successes: \"I worked hard; I deserved this regardless of pattern\" The Structural Effect : Pattern becomes destiny via attribution: - Employer sees pattern-constrained worker fail: \"Confirmed their pattern\" - Employer sees pattern-privileged worker fail: \"Bad luck; give them another chance\" - The attribution difference creates the outcome difference - Which confirms the pattern - Which reinforces the attribution The Horror : The pattern is real (it accurately predicts). But it's real because people believe it's real and act accordingly. Unraveling which part is \"genuine fate\" and which part is \"attribution-driven prophecy\" is impossible. Philosophical Frameworks Made Literal 14. Determinism vs. Free Will (The Core Tension) The Problem : If fate is real and readable, is choice meaningful? H\u00e1lcova's Answer : The question is mal-formed. Here's why: The Loom predicts choices. It doesn't make them. Your choice is still yours\u2014you experience deliberation, you feel the decision, you're responsible for outcomes. But the choice was also predicted. Competing Readings : Compatibilist : Determinism and free will coexist. Your choices are determined AND free simultaneously. The prediction doesn't remove the choice; it just reveals what you were always going to choose. Hard Determinist : The prediction proves you never had choice. The feeling of choosing is illusion. Agency is story, not reality. Libertarian : The Loom isn't predicting; it's causing. Fate is enforced, not observed. True freedom requires breaking the system. Pragmatist : The question doesn't matter. You have to act as if you have choice because acting otherwise is paralysis. Whether choice is \"real\" is philosophy; living requires decision. The Horror : All four readings are defensible. The evidence supports all of them. People choose their metaphysics based on temperament, not proof. Your position on free will becomes part of your pattern. 15. The Ship of Theseus (Identity and Binding) The Problem : If you replace every component of something, is it still the same thing? How It Manifests : Multiple magic systems transform identity: - Core Binding: Bleed replaces parts of you with echo-pattern - Flesh Shaping: Your physical substrate is modified - Pact Summoning: Your soul is consumed in installments - Colony Hosting: Your body integrates foreign material - Fate Threading: You absorb other versions of yourself The Question : After extensive practice, are you still \"you\"? Competing Answers : Orthodox : Your S\u00f3rscad defines you. Pattern changes are legible. You're \"you\" until your pattern is too corrupted to read\u2014then you're something else. Fleshwright : The ship metaphor assumes stable identity. Identity is process, not substance. \"You\" are whatever the current configuration is doing. Elsewhere Faction (Mirrors) : Identity is observer-dependent. You're \"you\" to those who remember the old configuration. You're someone else to those who only know the new. Ancestor Speaker : Identity is relational. You're \"you\" as long as your echo would recognize you. The dead are the anchor. The Horror : There's no fact of the matter. Different frameworks give different answers. Your sense of continuity may be accurate or may be false memory constructed by your current configuration. You can't check. 16. The Experience Machine (Elsewhere Entities) The Problem : If you could enter a machine that gives you any experience you want, should you? What makes \"real\" experiences valuable? How It Manifests : The Hungry faction of Elsewhere entities wants sensation. They offer: - Any experience you can imagine - No physical consequences in your world - Pure sensation, unlimited The Implicit Bargain : What you lose: - Authenticity (experiences are generated, not earned) - Connection (others can't share the experience) - Growth (you're not learning from resistance) - Reality (you're in something else's domain) What you gain: - Everything else The Horror : The Hungry don't force anyone. They offer. People accept. The experience machine is real and available. The philosophical question has a practical answer: yes, many people choose simulation over reality. And it's not clear they're wrong. The Elsewhere as Competing Economic System The Core Idea The Elsewhere isn't a place. It's an alternative transaction framework. In H\u00e1lcova : - Scarcity is fundamental - Exchange requires equivalent value - Ledgers must balance - Debt creates obligation In the Elsewhere : - Scarcity may not apply (or applies differently) - Exchange follows different rules - \"Balance\" has different meaning - Debt and obligation are the only reality The Factions as Economic Philosophies The Accountants : Debt as fundamental reality. Everything is owed. The universe is a ledger. They don't want your soul to destroy it\u2014they want your soul because you owe it. The debt always existed; paying is just acknowledgment. The Hungry : Consumption as fundamental value. Experience is the only good. Scarcity is the only evil. They offer abundance because abundance is right. The cost is dependency, but dependency on abundance beats independence in scarcity. The Architects : Order as fundamental value. Arrangement matters. Position determines function. They don't want destruction\u2014they want reconfiguration. You in the right place, doing the right function, forever. The Mirrors : Observation as fundamental reality. To be seen is to exist. They don't consume\u2014they witness. Your value is as object of attention. They offer significance (being watched) in exchange for access (being seen). The Absent : Negation as fundamental value. The absence of desire, the absence of transaction, the absence of existence. They want nothing because wanting is the problem. What do they offer? Release. From the ledger. From the pattern. From existence. The Metaphysical Competition H\u00e1lcova's reality and Elsewhere compete for... something. Souls? Pattern-mass? Existential territory? The K\u00f6d bleed is border conflict. The polar structures are fortifications. The Loom may be weapon, defense system, or neutral infrastructure captured by one side. The war\u2014if it is a war\u2014has no front, no treaties, no clear stakes. Just pressure at the boundaries and casualties on both sides (though \"casualty\" means different things to each). The Loom as Attention Economy The Core Idea What if the Loom doesn't predict fate\u2014it allocates attention? The Mechanism : Reality in H\u00e1lcova may require observation to stabilize. Unobserved events remain probabilistic. The Loom directs attention\u2014deciding which possibilities collapse into actuality. The Implications : Prediction is Selection : The Loom doesn't see what will happen; it decides what will happen by choosing what to observe. Prediction and causation are the same act. The Attendance is Observer : Whatever answers queries is the observing entity. Its attention creates reality. Its attention is finite (or it would observe everything). Querying the Loom directs its attention. The Competition for Observation : There's not enough attention for everyone. Some people/events get observed (their fates crystallize). Others remain fuzzy (deviation is possible). The allocation of attention is the allocation of fate. The Horror : Getting the Loom's attention isn't protection\u2014it's determination. The pattern-illegible aren't cursed; they're free. Deviation isn't defiance; it's slipping through the cracks where attention doesn't reach.

The future they didn't choose had value\u2014stored potential\u2014and they're cashing it out. But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to you . When you harvest one: - Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path - Permanently close that path (it's been spent) - Reduce your total remaining \"decision space\" The Horror : Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic\u2014not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives. The Economic Parallel : This is exactly how real opportunity costs work.

How It Manifests : Core Binding creates echoes\u2014remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding. The fallacy manifests when: - The echo becomes corrupted or hostile - The echo's information becomes outdated - The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: \"I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment.\" The Horror : Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds. The Structural Element : The magic system rewards sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful\u2014if you can hold on long enough.

How It Manifests : Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard: - You get the power - Someone else pays the price - Your incentive to be cautious evaporates The Structure : First-level hazard : You make a pact, knowing you can transfer costs to others. You take risks you wouldn't if you had to pay personally. Second-level hazard : Entities know this. They design pacts that encourage substitution because substitution feeds them more souls than cautious single-source extraction would. Third-level hazard : Society knows substitution is possible. This creates: - A market for \"willing\" substitutes (debt bondage, religious sacrifice, criminal punishment) - Insurance-like structures where groups pool substitution risk - Political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses The Horror : The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption. Every structural incentive pushes toward finding more people to substitute. The pact-maker who started trying to save their child from illness ends up feeding strangers to the entity because the entity structured the deal to encourage exactly that progression. The Real-World Parallel : This is how moral hazard works in finance, insurance, environmental policy.

But: - Enforcement generates Residue (executions produce fuel) - Deviants threaten power structures that benefit the Order - The Attunement itself may be a form of control (Wardens can't deviate, so they enforce anti-deviation) The Horror : Wardens genuinely believe they serve higher purposes. The Attunement makes doubt physically painful. But the structure of their situation means their interests align with enforcement regardless of whether enforcement serves the principals they claim.

Atmospheric Composition Basic Structure Primary Components : - Nitrogen: ~82% (higher than Earth's 78%) - Oxygen: ~17% (lower than Earth's 21%) - Argon: ~0.8% - Pattern Residue (gaseous/particulate): Variable, 0.01-0.5% - Carbon Dioxide: ~0.02% (lower than Earth\u2014less greenhouse effect) - Water Vapor: Variable by region and season The Reduced Greenhouse Effect H\u00e1lcova has less atmospheric warming than its distance from S\u00e1rgvas would suggest: Contributing Factors : - Lower CO2 concentration - Lower methane - Pattern Residue's heat-absorption (removes energy from thermal cycling) - Higher nitrogen dilutes warming gases Result : Baseline temperature is colder than orbital position alone would predict. Oxygen Considerations Lower oxygen (17% vs 21%): - Slightly harder breathing at elevation - Fire burns less intensely (affects technology) - Large creatures may be more efficient breathers - Visitors from higher-oxygen worlds would notice Implications for the Residue Economy : Reduced oxygen means fire burns cooler and slower: - Residue furnaces require more efficient designs to achieve useful temperatures - Open-air Residue burning is less effective than enclosed, oxygen-enriched systems - Bellows and forced-air systems are essential for metallurgy and industry - Spontaneous fires are rarer (harder to ignite accidentally) - Residue fires can be more easily controlled but also harder to start This actually benefits civilization in some ways\u2014uncontrolled fires spread more slowly, giving more time to respond.

Sky Color and Light Daytime Sky Color : Teal-tinged blue The amber-orange light from S\u00e1rgvas scatters differently in H\u00e1lcova's atmosphere: - Blue wavelengths still scatter most (Rayleigh scattering) - But the incoming light has less blue to begin with - Result: sky appears more teal or cyan than Earth's pure blue - At high altitudes, shifts toward purple-grey Regional Variation : - Clear polar skies: Deep teal, almost greenish - Temperate regions: Teal-blue, varies with dust and Residue - Middle Waters: Hazier, more grey-blue (humidity) - Vent Lands: Often tinged orange (volcanic particulates) Sunrise and Sunset Duration : Longer than Earth's (slower rotation) Color Progression : 1. Pre-dawn: Deep purple to violet 2. Early dawn: Blood red to orange 3. Sunrise: Amber-gold, intense 4. Post-sunrise: Bronze fading to teal 5. Pre-sunset: Bronze returning 6.

Appearance : - Like heat haze, but without heat correlation - Makes distant objects waver slightly - Stars twinkle more intensely - Moons develop subtle halos When It Occurs : - High aurora activity - Post-battle or post-disaster (fresh Residue release) - Peak L\u00e1ng (maximum atmospheric concentration) - Pre-precipitation during Csend (Residue about to crystallize out) Intensity During K\u00f6d : The shimmer intensifies dramatically during the fifth season: - Constant visible distortion - The sky seems to vibrate - Looking at stars becomes uncomfortable - In polar regions, the shimmer is so strong it interferes with vision The Dark Bands What They Are : Visible shadows across the night sky where Pattern Residue concentration creates opacity.

Understanding what happened, when, and why is one of the great mysteries of H\u00e1lcovan scholarship. Evidence for a Warmer Past Geological Evidence Fossil Flora : - Deep rock strata contain impressions of plants that cannot survive in current conditions - Broad-leafed species (not narrow, cold-adapted forms) - Vegetation patterns suggesting temperate to subtropical climates - Found even in high-latitude locations now under permanent ice Sedimentary Records : - Ancient river deltas in regions now covered by glaciers - Lake bed formations in the interior plateau - Coastal erosion patterns inconsistent with current ice-locked shores - Evidence of rain-based weathering (now almost everything is freeze-thaw) Ice Core Analysis : - Air bubbles trapped in ancient ice contain different atmospheric composition - Higher CO2 in older samples - Lower Pattern Residue signatures in pre-cooling layers - Distinct layer marking the transition (datable, approximately 40,000-50,000 years ago) Archaeological Evidence Ruins in Impossible Locations : - Structures found under northern ice cap - Building materials and techniques unsuited to extreme cold - No heating infrastructure (suggesting it wasn't needed) - Agricultural tools, storage facilities for warm-climate crops The Polar Complexes : - Both polar regions contain ancient structures - Northern complex: appears residential/ceremonial - Southern complex: appears to be containment/industrial - Both predate all known civilizations - Both were operational before the cooling Coastal Cities Now Underwater : - Sea levels were different (both higher in some places, lower in others) - Submerged ruins in shallow waters - Navigation hazards that are clearly artificial origin - Suggests different shorelines, different habitable zones Biological Evidence Relic Species : - Some organisms in Middle Waters appear adapted to warmer conditions - Genetic diversity suggests recent (geologically) isolation from larger populations - \"Warm-adapted\" traits that make no sense for current climate Domestication Gaps : - Domestic species show genetic bottleneck ~40,000 years ago - Wild ancestors extinct or drastically reduced - Suggests catastrophic population collapse around the same time as cooling The Cooling Event What We Know Timing : Approximately 40,000-50,000 years before present (local years) Speed : Geologically rapid\u2014possibly within a few thousand years, perhaps faster Magnitude : Average temperatures dropped 15-25\u00b0C globally Pattern : Not uniform\u2014polar regions cooled most, equatorial regions least Possible Natural Causes Orbital Shift : Could the planet's orbit have changed? - Would require external force (massive impact, gravitational interference) - No evidence of impact crater of sufficient size - No evidence of planetary capture or encounter Volcanic Winter : Massive volcanic activity could have blocked sunlight. - Some evidence of heightened volcanism around the right time - But volcanic winters are temporary\u2014this cooling persisted - Vent Lands volcanism predates the cooling and continued through it Atmospheric Change : Something removed greenhouse gases. - CO2 levels did drop, but this could be effect rather than cause - What could remove that much CO2 that quickly? - No known natural mechanism The Pattern Residue Theory The Core Hypothesis : Pattern Residue began accumulating in the atmosphere around the time of the cooling. Due to its net-negative thermodynamic properties , each death permanently removed heat from the planetary system. The cooling is a direct result of the Residue cycle establishing itself. The Net-Negative Mechanism : Pattern Residue operates on an energy-losing cycle: 1. Death absorbs massive thermal energy during Residue formation (100% of pattern-weight) 2. Atmospheric Residue continues absorbing heat (additional 10-20%) 3. Even when burned, Residue only releases 60-70% of absorbed energy 4. The remaining 30-40% is permanently lost (exotic matter decay, Elsewhere transfer) 5. Every death = net heat loss for H\u00e1lcova Supporting Evidence : - Ice cores show Residue appearing at the transition layer - Residue concentration correlates with temperature drop - Current Residue distribution matches thermal patterns - The net-negative mechanism is observable and measurable - Energy budget calculations confirm more heat absorbed than released The Question : Where did the initial Residue come from? Options: Mass Death Event : Something killed an enormous population, releasing enough Residue to trigger the cooling cascade The Elsewhere Opened : Residue (or the mechanism that creates it) entered from outside reality It Was Manufactured : The Loom's activation generated Residue as a byproduct or intentional feature It Was Always There : But something triggered a phase transition, activating its thermodynamic properties The Engineered Cooling Theory The Core Hypothesis : The cooling was deliberate. Someone\u2014an ancient civilization, the Elsewhere, or something else\u2014chose to freeze the planet by introducing or activating the Residue cycle. Supporting Evidence : - The polar structures predate the cooling but appear designed for it - The southern polar complex looks like a prison (designed to contain something) - The northern polar complex is at a reality-wound (designed to seal something?) - Pattern Residue's distribution isn't random\u2014it's concentrated where it would do most \"work\" - The net-negative thermodynamic properties seem designed rather than evolved Possible Purposes : Containment : The cold keeps something imprisoned. The Residue cycle was engineered as a self-sustaining prison mechanism\u2014the more it struggles, the more death it causes, the colder it gets, the stronger the prison. Defense : The cold keeps something out. The Elsewhere can't fully manifest in extreme cold (supported by Middle Waters' K\u00f6d protection). The planet was weaponized against invasion by creating a system where resistance = cooling. Preservation : The cold preserves something. Under the ice, something valuable\u2014knowledge, technology, a sleeping entity\u2014waits to be recovered. The cooling was protective, not destructive. Consequence : The cooling wasn't the goal but the cost. The Loom required activation energy. Pattern Residue is the exhaust. The cold is the price of fate-reading. Transformation : The cooling changed H\u00e1lcova's inhabitants. The ancient builders became something else\u2014the Attendance, the Elsewhere entities, or something stranger\u2014and left behind a world shaped for whatever they became. The Ancient Civilization Question Who Built the Polar Structures? The Evidence : - Structures predate any known human civilization - Construction techniques don't match any historical tradition - Scale suggests resources beyond anything current civilizations could mobilize - Purpose is unclear but evidently important Theories : Pre-Human Inhabitants : A non-human intelligent species existed before current H\u00e1lcovan life. They built, they modified the moons, they did whatever caused the cooling, and they're gone. Where did they go? Died in the cooling they caused? Transcended? Became the Elsewhere entities? Unknown. Early Humans with Lost Technology : Humans existed longer than records show. The cooling destroyed their civilization. Survivors regressed. Current history is a rebuilding from collapse. The technology wasn't magic\u2014it was something else, now lost. Elsewhere Origin : The structures weren't built by H\u00e1lcova natives. They were built by or for Elsewhere entities. The wound at the northern pole is their entrance. The prison at the southern pole holds something they imprisoned\u2014or something that imprisoned them. The Loom Itself : The structures are proto-Loom installations. The current Loom is a degraded descendant of something that once operated on a planetary scale. The cooling was a side effect of the Loom's creation or operation. What Happened to the Ancient Builders? The Disappearance No bodies. No clear evidence of massacre, plague, or exodus. They built structures that still stand, and then they're simply absent from the record. Extinction Theories : The Cold Killed Them : They caused the cooling and couldn't survive it. Engineering hubris. They Left : Advanced enough to build what they built, advanced enough to leave. But where? Elsewhere? Another world? They Changed : They didn't die\u2014they became something else. Integrated with the Elsewhere. Became the Attendance. Uploaded into the Loom. They're Still Here : Hiding. Sleeping. Waiting. Under the ice. In the Elsewhere. In places we haven't looked. What They Left Behind The Polar Structures : Still functional in some sense. Still doing whatever they were built to do. The wound bleeds; the prison holds. The Moon Arrangement : If they arranged the moons, that's ongoing. The tidal effects, the resonances, the magical correlations\u2014all still operating. Pattern Residue : Did they create it? Modify it? Introduce it to the planet? It may be their most significant legacy, the foundation of all H\u00e1lcovan magic. The Loom (possibly): Is the Loom their creation, their descendant, or their continuation? The Attendance that answers queries\u2014is that them? A piece of them? Their replacement? Implications for Current H\u00e1lcova Climate Trajectory Is the Cooling Ongoing? Current evidence suggests equilibrium. The cooling has stabilized. The world isn't getting colder\u2014but it isn't warming either. Could It Reverse? Unknown. If Pattern Residue absorption is causing the cold, reducing Residue might warm the planet. But Residue is tied to population death. Reducing Residue requires reducing death. The incentives are complex. If the polar structures are maintaining the cold, damaging them might change things. But the northern wound might widen. The southern prisoner might escape. The cure could be worse than the disease. Deliberate Climate Engineering : In theory, concentrated Residue-burning could warm regions. In practice, the Residue economy makes this politically impossible. Those who control Residue profit from scarcity. A warmer world threatens their power. The Polar Expeditions Why Go There? - Understanding what's under the ice - Recovering ancient technology or knowledge - Assessing the wound and prison status - Resource extraction (concentrated Residue deposits) - Religious pilgrimage (various traditions) Why Not? - Extreme conditions - K\u00f6d bleed effects (during the fifth season) - The Warden Order restricts access - Rumors of what expeditions find (and what finds them) - Most who go don't return, or return changed The Questions That Matter Practical : - Can we understand what the ancients did? - Can we use their technology? - Can we undo or modify the cooling? - What are the risks of interfering? Philosophical : - Did the ancients make the right choice? - Is the cold protecting us or imprisoning us? - What would we do differently if we could? - Who decides? The Oral Traditions Legends of the Warm Time Every culture on H\u00e1lcova has stories of a warmer age: The Heartlands : \"Before The Weaver's cold breath, the land was green and the sun was kind. Our ancestors sinned\u2014forgot the pattern\u2014and winter came as punishment.\" The Shattered Reaches : \"The islands were one great land before the breaking. When the world cracked, the cold poured in through the wound.\" The Middle Waters : \"We are the remnant of the warm time. Our islands remember. The fire below keeps the old covenant.\" The Vent Lands : \"The cold is a beast that hunts. Our mountains breathe fire to hold it at bay. We have always fought.\" The Far Shelf : \"The ice came from beyond. It brought the patterns with it. Before the ice, we were free.\" Common Elements Across all traditions: - The world was warmer - Something changed (sin, catastrophe, invasion, choice) - The cold is connected to fate/pattern/the Loom - Some places remember (Middle Waters, Vent Lands) - The change might not be permanent Religious Interpretations Orthodox : The cooling is The Weaver's design. The warm time was chaos; the cold brings order. Questioning is impiety. Threadist : The cooling was one choice among many. The ancients chose cold; we might choose differently. The design is unfinished. Hollow Saint : The cooling is the prison's construction. Fate is a cage of ice. Escape means melting. Colony Cult : The colonies remember the warm time. Their patterns contain fragments of the old world. Hosting connects you to what was. Summary The evidence is clear: H\u00e1lcova was warmer 40,000-50,000 years ago. Something\u2014an ancient civilization, the Elsewhere, a natural event, or deliberate engineering\u2014caused a rapid cooling. Pattern Residue may be the mechanism or the byproduct. The polar structures are involved. The moon arrangement may be related. The cooling created current H\u00e1lcova: the ice world, the Residue economy, the survival imperative, the magic system that runs on death. Understanding what happened, and whether it can be changed, is both an academic question and an existential one. The ancients made choices. We live with the consequences. Whether we could\u2014or should\u2014choose differently is the question that underlies everything.

The result is an ecosystem that would seem alien to human eyes\u2014dark vegetation, cold-adapted creatures, and organisms that interact with the exotic matter that defines this world. The Light Environment S\u00e1rgvas Spectrum The K-type star provides: - Dominant orange-red light - Significant infrared - Reduced ultraviolet - Less total energy than a G-type star at equivalent distance Photosynthesis Adaptation Earth plants are green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, reflecting green. Under S\u00e1rgvas: - Less blue light available to absorb - More red and infrared available - Organisms evolved to absorb different wavelengths The Result : H\u00e1lcova's photosynthetic organisms absorb across a wider spectrum, including more infrared. They reflect very little, appearing dark to human-equivalent eyes. Flora by Climate Zone Polar Transition Zone (Darkest) Coloration : Black to deep charcoal Reason : Maximum light absorption needed; every photon counts Dominant Forms : Black Lichen - Encrusting growth on rocks, ice-free surfaces - Survives temperatures to -50\u00b0C - Photosynthesizes during brief light periods - Contains Pattern Residue-processing compounds (one of the few organisms that can) Shadow Moss - Thick, carpet-forming moss - Nearly black, occasionally deep purple - Insulating properties (creatures nest in it) - Grows on soil, dead vegetation, abandoned structures Pole-Creep - Extremely slow-growing woody plant - Hugs ground, never exceeds 10cm height - Wood is incredibly dense (centuries of growth compressed) - Valued for specialized construction Temperate Zones (Dark Purple to Deep Red) Coloration : Purple, maroon, deep burgundy Reason : Balance between absorption efficiency and avoiding overheating during L\u00e1ng Dominant Forms : Blackwood Trees - Coniferous trees with black bark, dark purple needles - Grow 20-40m tall in favorable conditions - Wood is hard, dark, valuable for construction - Needles contain compounds used in medicine Bloodgrass - Prairie-forming grass with deep red blades - Covers temperate lowlands - Turns nearly black in winter, red in summer - Feeds grazing herds Vein-Vine - Climbing plant with purple stems, dark red leaves - Wraps around other plants or structures - Produces small berries (edible, bitter) - Spreads aggressively in disturbed areas Duskflowers - Flowering plants in various dark hues - Bloom briefly during L\u00e1ng - Pollinated by cold-adapted insects and small flying creatures - Some species cultivated for dyes, medicine, ritual use Forest Character : Temperate forests on H\u00e1lcova are dark, cathedral-like spaces. The canopy absorbs most light. Undergrowth is sparse where canopy is thick. Sound carries strangely.

They come in all colors\u2014white, grey, brown, orange, blue, even bioluminescent. The Colony Organisms The fungi used in Colony Summoning are related to but distinct from natural fungi: Key Differences : - Process Pattern Residue (natural fungi avoid it) - Form symbiotic bonds with hosts (natural fungi don't) - Store \"patterns\" of consumed organisms (natural fungi just decompose) - Respond to host will (natural fungi have no such interaction) Origins Unknown : - Did Colony fungi evolve naturally? - Were they engineered by ancient civilization? - Did they come from the Elsewhere? - Are they somehow related to the thing imprisoned at the southern pole? Ecological Role : - Wild Colony organisms exist (feral colonies) - They consume dead matter and grow - Without hosts, they can spread unpredictably - Some regions have \"colony zones\"\u2014areas where wild colonies have established - These zones are dangerous and economically valuable Ecosystem Dynamics Food Webs Temperate Terrestrial : Vegetation (Blackwood, Bloodgrass) \u2193 Primary Consumers (Elk herds, small grazers) \u2193 Secondary Consumers (Wolf-equivalents, small predators) \u2193 Apex Predators (Glacier Bears, human hunters) Marine : Phytoplankton-equivalent \u2193 Small fish, filter feeders \u2193 Medium fish, cephalopods \u2193 Large fish, marine mammals \u2193 Leviathans, human fishers Seasonal Cycles Csend (Winter) : - Most animals hibernate or reduce activity - Predators hunt weakened prey - Frozen carrion preserved for later consumption - Residue accumulates (less biological processing) Olvad\u00e1s (Thaw) : - Awakening, breeding season begins - Disease spreads from thawed pathogens - Migratory species return - Residue releases from ice (flora and fauna respond) L\u00e1ng (Summer) : - Peak activity, breeding, feeding - Maximum biomass - Predation intense (building reserves) - Residue at peak atmospheric concentration Hanyatl\u00e1s (Decline) : - Preparation for winter - Migration begins - Final feeding push - Residue begins precipitating K\u00f6d (Veil) : - Animal behavior changes (affected by Elsewhere bleed) - Some species become aggressive - Some become docile, disoriented - Colony organisms highly active - Ash Moths swarm (Residue precipitation attracts them) Pattern Residue Ecology The Cycle : 1.

The geography tells a story\u2014the Heartlands and Shattered Reaches were once a single continent, torn apart by some ancient catastrophe. The rift that separated them became the Narrow Sea. The Shattered Heartlands Theory The Evidence Looking at the coastlines, the relationship is obvious: - The ragged eastern coast of the Greater Continent matches the western edge of the Shattered Reaches - Rock formations, mineral deposits, and fossil-equivalents continue across the gap - The Narrow Sea is a flooded rift valley, not a true ocean basin - Ancient ruins exist on both sides with matching architectural styles What Happened Unknown. Theories include: - Geological catastrophe (natural rift) - The same event that caused the cooling - Deliberate separation (by whom? why?) - Elsewhere incursion that physically tore reality - The creation of the Loom requiring tremendous energy release The shattering is ancient\u2014tens of thousands of years at minimum. But the mystery feeds religious interpretation, political claims, and treasure-hunting expeditions. The Greater Continent (The Heartlands) Shape and Structure A crescent-shaped landmass curving from northwest to southeast, with the concave side facing the Middle Waters. The curve creates a natural harbor effect for the entire southern coast. Dimensions : Roughly 4,000 km along the outer curve, 800-1,200 km wide at various points. Major Geographic Features The Spine Mountains ( Gerincl\u00e1ncz ) A mountain range running along the curve of the continent, roughly following the crescent's arc. This range: - Blocks polar winds from the interior - Creates a rain shadow effect (northern interior is dry and cold; southern coast receives moisture) - Contains the highest peaks on H\u00e1lcova - Rich in mineral deposits, including concentrated Pattern Residue veins Notable Peaks : - The Watcher ( Az \u0150rszem ): Highest peak, visible from the sea on clear days. Site of an ancient observatory, now a Loom relay station. - The Broken Tooth ( T\u00f6r\u00f6tt Fog ): A collapsed peak, evidence of ancient volcanic activity or something else. Hollow Saints claim it marks where \"fate cracked.\" - The Twins ( Az Ikrek ): Two peaks of nearly identical height, separated by a pass. The main land route between northern and southern Heartlands. The Interior Plateau ( Fenns\u00edk ) Behind the Spine, a vast elevated plateau stretches toward the northern ice. Characteristics: - Elevation: 1,500-2,000m above sea level - Climate: Cold, dry, windy - Vegetation: Hardy tundra grasses, black lichen, scattered dwarf trees - Population: Sparse\u2014nomadic herders, mining settlements, Warden outposts - Pattern Residue: High concentration (ancient battlefield sites, unexcavated) The River Valleys Major rivers cut through the Spine from the interior, creating the primary population centers. The Five Rivers : 1. The Gold ( Aranyi ): Largest river, drains to the southeast coast. The capital region. 2. The Iron ( Vasalj ): Northern river, flows to the Narrow Sea. Industrial heartland. 3. The Silent ( Csendi ): Flows north, disappears under the ice cap. Sacred to Ancestor Speakers. 4. The Broken ( T\u00f6r\u00f6tti ): Western river, fragmented into multiple channels. Difficult to navigate. 5. The Vein ( V\u00e9na ): Southern river, reddish sediment. Flesh Shaper territory\u2014the sediment is mineral, not blood, but the association stuck. The Southern Coast The concave inner coast facing the Middle Waters. Characteristics: - Climate: Mildest on the continent (warm current arrival) - Terrain: Rolling hills, river deltas, natural harbors - Population: Dense\u2014major cities, agricultural land, trade ports - Loom Coverage: Maximum\u2014the Great Node is here The Northern Edge Where the continent meets the ice cap. Characteristics: - Climate: Extreme\u2014permanent ice within 100km - Terrain: Glacial, unstable, constantly shifting - Population: Minimal\u2014extraction outposts, Warden stations, exiles - K\u00f6d Effects: Partial bleed zone during the fifth season Political Geography The Heartlands contain multiple political entities, but shared characteristics: - Orthodox faith dominant - Loom integration in governance - Recognition of the Great Node's authority (in religious matters at minimum) - Interconnected through the river valley trade networks Specific nations/kingdoms to be developed separately. The Shattered Reaches Shape and Structure The \"missing piece\" of the original continent, now fragmented into one large island-continent and hundreds of smaller islands. The western coast clearly shows where it once connected to the Heartlands.

Sailors navigating the Narrow Sea see both coasts and understand they're traveling through a wound. The Interior Highlands The main island's interior is mountainous\u2014a continuation of the Spine, now separated. Characteristics: - Peaks lower than the Spine (erosion, or the separation lowered them) - Heavy precipitation (maritime climate) - Dense, dark forests in the valleys (black-barked conifers) - Fast rivers with short courses to the sea The Fracture Zone The eastern portion of the main island and the inner island chains show evidence of additional breaking\u2014smaller rifts, sea-filled valleys, unstable geology. Theories: - Secondary breaks after the main separation - Ongoing geological instability - The pattern continues to crack - Elsewhere influence weakening material reality The Island Chains Hundreds of islands extending eastward: The Near Chains : Close to the main island, connected by sea ice during Csend. Large islands with permanent populations, small islands used seasonally. The Middle Chains : Further out, less connected. Independent communities, sometimes isolated for entire winters. Strong Ancestor Speaker traditions. The Far Chains : Scattered islands approaching the Far Water. Sparse population, expedition staging points, pirate havens. Maritime Character The Shattered Reaches are defined by the sea: - Every settlement is coastal or river-accessible - Naval power determines political influence - Fishing and sea-hunting are primary food sources - Shipbuilding is the prestige industry - Sea ice creates seasonal connectivity (Csend connects islands; Olvad\u00e1s isolates them) Political Geography Fragmented by design: - No continental-scale political unity - City-states control mainland harbors - Island kingdoms vary in size from single-island to chain-spanning - Merchant leagues provide economic coherence across political divisions - The Orthodox church is present but not dominant The Middle Waters Shape and Structure An archipelago of volcanic islands straddling the equatorial band. The warmest region on H\u00e1lcova\u2014the only place that never freezes. The Great Island : Central caldera island, roughly 200 km diameter Major Islands : 20-30 islands of significant size (50+ km) Minor Islands : Hundreds of smaller islands, atolls, and reef formations Major Geographic Features The Caldera ( The Eye ) The Great Island is the rim and interior of a dormant supervolcano. The caldera itself is partially flooded, creating a protected inner harbor of extraordinary value. Characteristics: - Caldera diameter: ~50 km - Rim elevation: 500-1,500m above sea level - Inner harbor: Deep, protected, warm - Geothermal activity: Hot springs, steam vents, warm ground - K\u00f6d protection: The caldera experiences almost no Elsewhere effects The Protection Mystery : Why is the caldera protected during K\u00f6d? Theories: - Geothermal energy disrupts the bleed - Ancient warding built into the volcanic structure - High life density anchors reality - Something in the caldera that Elsewhere avoids - Combination of factors The truth may involve ancient engineering\u2014the caldera shows signs of modification that don't match natural formation. The Reef Systems Cold-adapted reef analogues (not coral\u2014something else) surround many islands. Characteristics: - Built by colonial organisms adapted to cold water - Create protected lagoons and channels - Rich fishing grounds - Navigation hazards for unfamiliar sailors - Possible Pattern Residue interaction (the organisms may process it somehow) The Thermal Vents Underwater volcanic vents heat surrounding waters. Where these occur: - Water temperature is significantly higher - Unique ecosystems develop - Fog banks form (warm water meeting cold air) - Strategic value for winter fishing grounds Climate Advantage Why the Middle Waters stay warm: Latitude : Equatorial position receives maximum S\u00e1rgvas energy Volcanic heat : Geothermal contribution to ground and water temperature Ocean currents : Warm water pools here rather than flowing away quickly K\u00f6d protection : Less Pattern Residue precipitation during the strange season Unknown factor : The caldera's protection extends partially to surrounding islands Political Geography The most contested territory on H\u00e1lcova: - Every major power wants presence here - Colonial holdings, trading posts, military bases from multiple regions - Native island cultures caught between imperial interests - Colony Cults have significant influence (warm, wet conditions favor fungi) - Religious diversity\u2014Orthodoxy present but not dominant The Vent Lands Shape and Structure A continental fragment in the southern hemisphere, defined by extreme volcanic activity. Smaller than the Heartlands but geologically intense. Dimensions : Roughly 1,200 km north-south, 800 km east-west Coastline : Irregular, with many peninsulas and deep bays Major Geographic Features The Fire Range ( T\u0171zl\u00e1nc ) An active volcanic mountain chain running the length of the landmass. Characteristics: - 20+ active volcanoes - Continuous geothermal activity (hot springs, geysers, fumaroles) - Lava flows reshape geography on human timescales - Ash falls fertilize surrounding valleys - Toxic gas zones in low-lying areas The Thermal Valleys Protected valleys between volcanic ridges where geothermal heat creates habitable conditions. Characteristics: - Warm year-round (geothermal, not solar) - Lush vegetation (by H\u00e1lcova standards) - Dense population concentration - Natural hot water for bathing, cleaning, industrial processes - Some valleys toxic or unstable (constant monitoring required) The Steam Fields Where glaciers meet geothermal zones. Characteristics: - Constant steam and fog - Unstable footing (ice over warm ground) - Flash floods when ice dams break - Bizarre ice formations (frozen steam, thermal-sculpted glaciers) - Disorienting travel conditions The Sulfur Flats Lowland areas where volcanic gases concentrate. Characteristics: - Yellow-crusted ground (sulfur deposits) - Toxic air at ground level - Uninhabitable without protection - Valuable mineral extraction (sulfur, other volcanic minerals) - Worked by protected crews or homunculi Economic Advantage The Vent Lands don't need Pattern Residue for heat: - Geothermal energy provides heating, cooking, industrial power - Independence from the Residue trade network - Wealth from unique resources (volcanic minerals, geothermal-forged metals) - Political independence from Orthodox/Loom institutional pressure - Fleshwright traditions developed here (blood doesn't freeze; more experimentation possible) Political Geography Unified by geography rather than conquest: - Thermal valleys function as semi-independent city-states - Volcanic activity forces cooperation (warning systems, refugee support) - Trade federation rather than empire - Orthodoxy present but weaker (they need the Vent Lands more than reverse) - Fleshwright guilds have unusual legal status and power The Far Shelf Shape and Structure The most distant inhabited continent, in the southern hemisphere. Large, relatively flat, and cold. Dimensions : Roughly 2,000 km east-west, 1,500 km north-south Coastline : Long and exposed, few natural harbors Major Geographic Features The Shelf Proper The continent is a vast, low-elevation landmass\u2014a continental shelf that barely rises above sea level in many areas. Characteristics: - Elevation: 0-500m over most of the landmass - Terrain: Flat to gently rolling - Drainage: Poor\u2014marshes, bogs, seasonal lakes - Permafrost: Underlies most of the interior The Southern Ice Edge The continent's southern coast merges into the southern ice cap. Characteristics: - No clear boundary between land and ice - Glaciers extend from the cap across coastal regions - Ice cliffs along some stretches - Full K\u00f6d bleed zone The Mineral Ranges Low mountain ranges in the continental interior. Characteristics: - Rich ore deposits (iron, copper, rare metals) - Difficult extraction (permafrost, short work season) - Mining settlements operate seasonally or with heavy Residue-burning for heat - Tensions between extraction interests and indigenous populations The Tundra Most of the continental interior. Characteristics: - Black and purple vegetation mat (tundra grasses, lichens) - Migrating herd animals - Nomadic populations following herds - Long winters, brief intense summers - Less Loom coverage than any other inhabited region Frontier Character The Far Shelf is the edge of the known world: - Last region to be contacted/colonized - Still incompletely mapped in the interior - Indigenous populations with pre-Loom traditions - Threadist movements began here (distance from Orthodox center) - Hollow Saints operate more openly - Warden Order presence thin and stretched The Survival Paradox The Far Shelf is the poorest, coldest inhabited region\u2014yet it maintains independence from Heartlands integration. How? Resource Leverage Beneath the permafrost lie significant deposits: - Iron and copper in the Mineral Ranges - Rare metals essential for pattern-engine construction - Concentrated Pattern Residue from ancient death sites (frozen, preserved, unharvested for millennia) - The largest untapped Residue reserves on H\u00e1lcova The Far Shelf can't efficiently extract these resources, but neither can anyone else\u2014without local cooperation. This creates bargaining power: \"You want our minerals? Accept our terms.\" Decentralization as Defense There's nothing to conquer: - No capital city to capture - No central government to overthrow - No concentrated population to subjugate - Thousands of scattered settlements across hostile terrain Military conquest would require permanent occupation of territory larger than the Heartlands, in worse conditions, against populations that can simply withdraw into the interior. The logistics are impossible. Population Hardiness Generations of survival have created people genuinely harder to control: - Cold tolerance that outlasts occupying forces - Subsistence skills that don't depend on trade - Social structures that function without centralized hierarchy - Willingness to accept suffering that breaks invaders Cost-Benefit Calculation The Heartlands have done the math: - Conquest cost: Astronomical (logistics, casualties, ongoing occupation) - Conquest benefit: Marginal (resources still hard to extract, resistance ongoing) - Trade cost: Accepting Far Shelf independence and heterodoxy - Trade benefit: Access to resources without occupation costs Trade wins. The Far Shelf remains independent not through military strength but through being more trouble than it's worth. Hollow Saint Theology The region's dominant religious framework reframes poverty as virtue: - Suffering proves you're escaping fate's prison - Material deprivation is spiritual liberation - The cold that kills is also the cold that frees - Independence from the Loom is worth any physical cost This ideology makes the population resistant to the carrots that work elsewhere. They don't want integration. They want to be left alone to suffer freely. Political Geography Fragmented and contested: - Coastal trading posts controlled by distant powers - Interior effectively independent (hard to project power into tundra) - Indigenous confederacies resist external control - Colonial tensions with Heartlands interests - Religious heterodoxy tolerated by necessity The Seas The Narrow Sea Location : Between the Heartlands (east coast) and Shattered Reaches (west coast) Character : A flooded rift valley\u2014the wound where the continents separated Characteristics : - Width: 200-400 km at various points - Depth: Deep central channel (the original rift), shallow coastal shelves - Currents: Complex\u2014warm water entering from south, cold from north - Ice: Partially freezes during Csend (creates ice roads between landfalls) - Traffic: The busiest sea route on H\u00e1lcova Navigation Hazards : - Ice floes during Csend/Olvad\u00e1s - Fog banks where water temperatures differ - Tidal races in narrow passages - Submerged rocks (the rift left debris) Strategic Value : - Controls trade between two major regions - Historical site of naval conflicts - Chokepoints fortified on both sides - Whoever controls the Narrow Sea influences continental politics The Central Ocean Location : Between the northern landmasses and the southern (the gap in the middle of the ring) Character : The largest open ocean, surrounding the Middle Waters Characteristics : - Width: Variable\u20142,000+ km in places - Depth: Deep ocean basins - Currents: The Great Thermal Loop circulates here (warm from Middle Waters, cold returns from poles) - Ice: Center stays liquid even in Csend (thermal upwelling) - Traffic: Moderate\u2014dangerous crossing but necessary for inter-regional trade Navigation Hazards : - Distance (no landfalls for long stretches) - Storms (thermal gradient creates weather) - Cold (outside the Middle Waters warmth) - The Central Deep (a region where depth makes vessels feel uneasy\u2014possible Elsewhere bleed) The Vent Strait Location : Between the Middle Waters and the Vent Lands Character : A warm-water channel kept ice-free by geothermal activity Characteristics : - Width: 300-500 km - Depth: Moderate (volcanic seafloor) - Currents: Warm outflow from Vent Lands geothermal sources - Ice: Never freezes - Traffic: Heavy year-round Navigation Hazards : - Underwater volcanic activity (occasionally) - Dense fog (warm water, cold air) - Crowded shipping lanes - Piracy (year-round accessibility means year-round predation) The Far Water Location : Between the Shattered Reaches and the Far Shelf Character : The widest, coldest, most dangerous crossing Characteristics : - Width: 3,000+ km at minimum - Depth: Variable\u2014some shallow banks, some deep trenches - Currents: Cold, flowing from the southern ice - Ice: Ice-free in central regions, but icebergs drift through - Traffic: Light\u2014only when necessary Navigation Hazards : - Distance (the longest unsupported crossing) - Cold (requires heavy Residue-burning for heat) - Storms (nothing breaks them across this distance) - Icebergs (unpredictable, ship-killing) - Isolation (rescue is unlikely) The Bitter Crossing Location : Connecting the Heartlands and Far Shelf via polar route Character : Impassable except when frozen Characteristics : - Route: Curves north through near-polar waters - Summer: Impossible\u2014ice pack, bergs, no continuous route - Csend: Freezes solid\u2014becomes an ice road - Duration: 60+ days to cross on foot/sled The Ice Road : - Historical primary connection before long-distance sailing - Still used for heavy cargo that can't risk sea voyage - Operates only during Csend (narrow window) - Crosses partial K\u00f6d bleed zone\u2014travelers must finish before the fifth season - Warden outposts along the route (for safety and monitoring) The Polar Regions The Northern Cap Extent : Everything north of approximately 70\u00b0 latitude equivalent Characteristics : - Permanent ice sheet (3-4 km thick in center) - No permanent human habitation in deep polar zone - Transition zone (ice edge to permanent ice) is seasonally accessible - Full K\u00f6d bleed during the fifth season What's There : - Ice - Concentrated Pattern Residue (ancient, unharvested) - Ruins under the ice (confirmed by expeditions) - Creatures adapted to extreme cold (rare, dangerous) - Something else (see: Polar Mystery) The Southern Cap Extent : Everything south of approximately 65\u00b0 latitude equivalent (extends further north due to continental anchoring by the Far Shelf) Characteristics : - Permanent ice sheet (thinner than northern, 1-2 km) - Merges with the Far Shelf's southern coast - Slightly more accessible (land connection) - Full K\u00f6d bleed during the fifth season - Different character from the northern cap (see: Polar Mystery) What's There : - Ice - The Shelf's southern glaciers - Mineral deposits (inaccessible) - Something different from the north (see: Polar Mystery) The Polar Mystery The Core Truth : The two poles are not the same. The Northern Cap: The Wound - This is where the Elsewhere connects to H\u00e1lcova - The K\u00f6d bleed isn't entities \"breaking through\"\u2014it's leakage from a permanent connection - The ice and cold may be natural, or may be attempting to seal/slow the leakage - Ancient ruins here may be from a civilization that understood the connection (and failed to close it) The Southern Cap: The Prison - Something is contained here - The Pattern Residue concentration is higher than it should be (deliberate accumulation) - The cold is more engineered than natural - Ancient structures here appear designed to hold, not to live - Whatever is contained was put there by someone who understood both the Elsewhere and the Loom The Implications : - Expeditions to the north find evidence of contact with the Elsewhere - Expeditions to the south find evidence of imprisonment - Very few people know both truths - The relationship between the wound and the prisoner is unclear (did one cause the other? are they related entities? is the prisoner there to guard the wound?) Ocean Currents: The Great Thermal Loop The System Water circulation in H\u00e1lcova's oceans follows a pattern shaped by temperature gradients, weak Coriolis effect, and geothermal sources. Surface Currents (Warm) The Middle Flow : - Warm water pools in the Middle Waters (equatorial heating + volcanic) - Surface flow moves north and south toward poles - Carries heat, moderating coastal temperatures - Provides moisture for precipitation - Supports marine life migration patterns Regional Branches : Southern Heartlands Current : Warm water reaches the Heartlands' concave coast, making it the mildest continental region. This is why civilization centered here first. Vent Lands Branch : Warm current meets geothermal outflow, creating exceptionally warm waters in the Vent Strait. Year-round ice-free, rich fishing. Shattered Reaches Split : Current divides around the main island. Western branch keeps inner channels warmer. Eastern branch cools quickly, making far islands colder. Far Shelf Failure : Current disperses before reaching the Far Shelf. No warm water arrives. Coldest coasts. Deep Currents (Cold) The Return Flow : - Surface water cools as it moves poleward - Cold water sinks at high latitudes - Deep current returns toward equator - Upwells in certain zones, bringing nutrients Regional Effects : The Northern Heartlands Coast : Cold return current makes these waters harsh. Fishing is dangerous but productive (nutrient-rich upwelling). The Central Deep Upwelling : Where cold water rises in the Central Ocean. Rich fishing, but far from land. Creates the \"uneasy\" zone where vessels feel observed. The Vent Upwelling : Where geothermal heat meets cold deep water. Massive nutrient concentration. The richest fishing grounds on H\u00e1lcova. Fog-shrouded, difficult to navigate. Seasonal Variations L\u00e1ng (Summer) : - Surface currents strongest (maximum heating) - Ice retreat reveals more ocean surface - Trade routes fully open - Fish populations migrate with warm water Csend (Winter) : - Surface currents weakest - Ice formation begins at high latitudes - Currents may shift as ice blocks normal flows - Some routes become impassable Olvad\u00e1s (Thaw) : - Meltwater influx disrupts currents - Unpredictable flows - Dangerous for shipping (currents don't follow normal patterns) - Rich nutrient release from melting ice Further documentation needed on: Specific coastline details, exact current speeds and patterns, submarine geology, maritime culture and technology","title":"Geography"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/geography/#halcova-geography-and-continental-structure","text":"","title":"H\u00e1lcova: Geography and Continental Structure"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/geography/#overview","text":"H\u00e1lcova's landmasses are arranged around the habitable equatorial band, with two major continents and three significant landmasses forming five distinct regions.

Hollow Saint Theology The region's dominant religious framework reframes poverty as virtue: - Suffering proves you're escaping fate's prison - Material deprivation is spiritual liberation - The cold that kills is also the cold that frees - Independence from the Loom is worth any physical cost This ideology makes the population resistant to the carrots that work elsewhere. They don't want integration. They want to be left alone to suffer freely.","title":"The Survival Paradox"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/geography/#political-geography_4","text":"Fragmented and contested: - Coastal trading posts controlled by distant powers -

The energy absorbed during Residue formation exceeds the energy that can be released through burning. This is the fundamental mechanism behind H\u00e1lcova's cold. Phase 1: Formation (Death) When a pattern-bearing creature dies: - The pattern dissolves, releasing Residue - This dissolution process absorbs massive thermal energy from the environment - The energy absorbed is proportional to the pattern's \"weight\" (complexity, fate-significance) - A heavy pattern death can drop local temperature by several degrees - This heat becomes bound within the Residue's exotic matter structure Phase 2: Atmospheric Residue Unharvested Residue disperses into the environment: - Continues absorbing ambient heat (though more slowly than at formation) - Reaches saturation over time - Slowly re-radiates some energy, but absorption rate exceeds re-radiation - Net effect: persistent heat drain from environment Phase 3: Harvesting and Burning When Residue is collected and burned: - Releases stored thermal energy (useful heat) - Residue becomes \"spent\" or \"ash\"\u2014thermodynamically inert - Critical : Only ~60-70% of absorbed energy is recoverable through burning - The remaining 30-40% is permanently lost (converted to exotic matter decay, radiated as undetectable frequencies, or transferred to Elsewhere) The Net-Negative Result : Every death absorbs X thermal energy. Burning that death's Residue releases only 0.6-0.7X energy. The difference is permanently removed from H\u00e1lcova's thermal budget. Over millennia, this has cooled the world. The Feedback Loop : 1. Death releases Pattern Residue (absorbs heat) 2. Residue disperses, continues absorbing heat 3. Environment cools 4. Cold contributes to more death 5. More Residue released 6. Even with burning, net heat loss continues 7. Equilibrium reached when death rate balances Residue decay The Civilization Counter-Loop : - Harvested Residue provides useful heat (cities can be warm) - But harvesting doesn't recover all absorbed energy - Cities become warm islands surrounded by colder hinterlands - Residue trade flows from death-sites to population centers - The system requires constant death to maintain warmth Implications : - Civilization survives by burning death\u2014but it's thermodynamically inefficient - Peace reduces fuel supply AND allows ambient Residue to accumulate (cooling) - War produces Residue AND prevents accumulation through harvesting - The dark bargain: death makes the world cold, but burning death is the only warmth - Middle Waters' warmth comes from geothermal sources, not Residue\u2014making them uniquely independent - Polar regions are extreme because ancient mass death was never harvested, and the Residue saturated the environment The Five Seasons Year Structure Year Length : 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) Season Breakdown : - Csend (Silence): 76 days - Olvad\u00e1s (Thaw): 76 days - L\u00e1ng (Flame): 77 days - Hanyatl\u00e1s (Decline): 76 days - K\u00f6d (Veil): 45 or 46 days (see Long K\u00f6d cycle below) - Total : 350.667 days (average) The Long K\u00f6d Cycle : The fractional day accumulates across years. Every third year, K\u00f6d extends to 46 days instead of 45. These \"Long K\u00f6d\" years are culturally significant: - More time for Elsewhere bleed (dangerous in polar regions) - Additional day of uncertainty and strangeness - Traditional time for major decisions, pact-making, and pattern-defying acts - Calendar-keepers track the cycle; ordinary people simply know \"some K\u00f6d seasons are longer\" - The sequence: Short (45d), Short (45d), Long (46d), repeat 1. Csend (CHEND) \u2014 \"The Silence\" Position : Aphelion + maximum tilt away (northern hemisphere) Duration : 76 days Character : Deep winter, coldest season Conditions : - Shortest days (as little as 10 hours dim light at high latitudes) - Most extreme cold - Rivers, ports, and seas frozen - Minimal Pattern Residue in atmosphere (Loom less accurate) - Travel only on ice roads - Perfect preservation of dead (Core Binding harvest season) Cultural Associations : Death, endurance, ancestors, debt settlement 2. Olvad\u00e1s (OL-vah-dahsh) \u2014 \"The Thaw\" Position : Moving toward perihelion Duration : 76 days Character : Early spring, dangerous transition Conditions : - Temperatures rising but unstable - Ice breaking up\u2014flooding, dangerous travel - Pattern Residue rising (concentrated in ice, released in melt) - Narrow planting window - Disease season (frozen pathogens thaw) - Loom accuracy improving Cultural Associations : Rebirth, danger, disease, opportunity, gambling 3.

K\u00f6d (KUHD) \u2014 \"The Veil\" Position : Aphelion approach, immediately before Csend Duration : 45-46 days (shorter than other seasons) Character : The strange season, Elsewhere bleed Conditions : - Temperatures falling, darkness increasing - Pattern Residue precipitating heavily - The boundary between H\u00e1lcova and Elsewhere thins - Effects vary by latitude (see below) The Bleed Gradient : Zone K\u00f6d Effects Polar regions Full bleed\u2014Elsewhere entities manifest without summoning High latitudes Partial bleed\u2014entities sensed, partial manifestations, voices Temperate band Minor phenomena\u2014vivid dreams, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, paranoia Middle Waters Almost nothing\u2014warmth/volcanism/density provides protection Cultural Associations : The unknown, Elsewhere, madness, visions, transformation Geography Continental Structure Five distinct regions across two major continents and three significant landmasses, arranged around the habitable equatorial band. The Five Regions 1. The Greater Continent (The Heartlands) Location : Largest landmass, northern habitable band Geography : - Central mountain spine (east-west, blocks polar winds) - Large interior plateau (cold, harsh, sparse population) - River valleys to coasts (population centers) - Northern edge merges into ice cap Character : - Orthodox faith dominant - Great Loom Node (largest, oldest, most accurate) - Political center\u2014unified governance (empires, kingdoms) - Oldest civilizations, deepest Residue deposits Climate : Subarctic (north) to cold continental (center) to \"mild\" coastal (south) 2. The Shattered Reaches Location : Fragmented landmass east of the Heartlands Geography : - One large island-continent broken by seas - Many smaller islands in chains and clusters - Rugged coastlines, deep fjords - Sea ice connects islands during Csend Character : - Politically fragmented (city-states, merchant leagues) - Naval power dominant - Trading culture connecting all regions - Religious diversity - Strong Ancestor Speaker traditions Climate : Maritime-moderated, foggier and wetter, shorter ice seasons 3. The Middle Waters Location : Island archipelago in equatorial band (warmest zone) Geography : - Volcanic island chain (geothermal heat) - Central \"great island\" (dormant supervolcano caldera) - Hundreds of smaller islands - Cold-adapted reef systems Character : - Most valuable real estate (warmth) - Contested by all other regions - Colony traditions strong (warm, wet favors fungal growth) - Unique ecosystem - Cultural melting pot Climate : Warmest on H\u00e1lcova (15-28\u00b0C in L\u00e1ng), never freezes 4. The Vent Lands Location : Volcanic continental fragment, southern hemisphere Geography : - Active volcanic ranges - Hot springs, geysers, fumaroles - Geothermal valleys (reliable heat) - Toxic zones (volcanic gas accumulation) - Glacier-thermal interfaces (flooding, steam) Character : - Heat independent of Residue (geothermal) - Wealthy (no fuel dependency) - Politically independent - Unique industries (geothermal metallurgy) - Fleshwright traditions strong - Weaker Orthodox presence Climate : Extreme local variation, steam weather, lush valleys next to frozen peaks 5. The Far Shelf Location : Most distant continent, southern hemisphere Geography : - Large, relatively flat landmass - Extensive tundra and taiga-equivalent - Mineral-rich, difficult extraction - Southern edge touches ice cap - Long coastlines, few harbors Character : - Frontier region (last colonized) - Heterodox faiths dominant - Threadist movements originated here - Hollow Saints more open presence - Less Loom coverage - Independence-minded population Climate : Cold even in L\u00e1ng, extreme seasonal darkness, shortest growing season The Seas The Narrow Sea : Between Heartlands and Shattered Reaches - Heavily trafficked, partially freezes in Csend - Major trade route, historical naval battles The Central Ocean : Between northern and southern landmasses - Large, dangerous - Liquid center even in Csend (thermal upwelling) - Middle Waters in warmest region The Vent Strait : Between Middle Waters and Vent Lands - Warm currents from geothermal activity - Never freezes, dense shipping The Far Water : Between Shattered Reaches and Far Shelf - Widest crossing, most dangerous - Storms, distance, cold The Bitter Crossing : Between Heartlands and Far Shelf (polar route) - Frozen solid in Csend (ice road) - Impassable other seasons - Historical only connection before long-distance sailing Polar Regions The Northern Cap : - Permanent ice sheet - No sustained civilization - Expedition territory only - Rumors of ancient ruins beneath ice - Source of rare materials - Full Elsewhere bleed during K\u00f6d The Southern Cap : - Permanent ice sheet - Touches Far Shelf's southern coast - Different character than northern cap (unknown why) - Full Elsewhere bleed during K\u00f6d K\u00f6d: The Fifth Season in Detail The Polar Bleed During K\u00f6d, the boundary between H\u00e1lcova and Elsewhere thins. The effect is strongest at the poles and diminishes toward the equator. Full Bleed (Polar Regions) Physical Environment : - Visual distortions (wrong distances, shifted colors) - Sound anomalies (echoes from nothing, unnatural silence) - Temperature fluctuations unconnected to weather - Ground-level aurora-like phenomena Entity Activity : - Elsewhere beings manifest without summoning - Appear partial, flickering, attention wandering - Most ignore humans; some don't - All five factions appear: - Accountants : Counting, ignoring unless debts exist - Hungry : Seeking sensation\u2014the dangerous ones - Architects : Adjusting, positioning, arranging - Mirrors : Watching, following, studying observers - Absent : Simply present, doing nothing visible Human Effects : - Pact Summoners feel entities without calling - Core Binders' echoes become hyperactive, may realize they're dead - Fate Threaders pull \"sideways\" futures - Colony hosts feel colonies reaching toward something - Unpacted humans: hallucinations, intrusions, compulsions Partial Bleed (Transition Zones) Entities sensed but not fully manifest Voices, glimpses, influences Stronger effects near polar edge Habitable but disturbing Some permanent settlements with adaptation strategies Minor Phenomena (Temperate Band) Vivid dreams, especially of unlived lives D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and premonition spikes Paranoia and suspicion increase Minor visual/auditory phenomena Loom predictions become strange (accurate about improbable things) Protected Zone (Middle Waters) Minimal K\u00f6d effects Theories: warmth, volcanic activity, population density, unknown factor Refugees flee toward Middle Waters during K\u00f6d Prices and tensions spike Who Enters the Polar Bleed? The Desperate : Seeking pacts without leverage, escaping patterns, pursuing forbidden knowledge The Fortified : Research expeditions, military operations, resource extraction (heavy protection) The Trapped : Outposts that can't evacuate, indigenous survivors, things that were human Religious Responses Orthodox : Polar bleed proves the danger of straying from The Weaver's design. Wardens close transition borders. Returnees examined for contamination. Threadist : The bleed shows fate is unfinished. Insights from K\u00f6d may reveal the collaborative nature of design. Hollow Saint : The bleed is the crack in fate's prison. Pilgrimage to the edge (not into full bleed) is holy work. Colony Cult : Colonies remember something from the bleed. The original unity existed there. Ancestor Speaker : Echoes become dangerous during K\u00f6d. This is when the dead most need binding\u2014for their protection. Fleshwright : Elsewhere entities are just different biology. Study them (safely) to understand life without pattern. Pattern Residue Thermodynamics: Technical Detail The Net-Negative Energy Model Pattern Residue is \"condensed probability\"\u2014fate-weight made physical. This exotic matter has unusual thermodynamic properties that result in permanent heat loss from the planetary system. Energy Budget Per Death : Phase Energy Flow Percentage Formation (death) Absorbed from environment 100% of pattern-weight Atmospheric drift Continued slow absorption +10-20% additional Burning (if harvested) Released as usable heat 60-70% of formation energy Net Loss Permanently removed 40-50% of total absorbed Where Does the Lost Energy Go? The ~40-50% of energy that doesn't return through burning is: - Converted to exotic matter structure (the Residue's physical form) - Radiated at frequencies H\u00e1lcova's matter cannot absorb - Transferred across the Elsewhere boundary (entities may feed on it) - Bound into spent Residue as latent instability (ash isn't truly inert\u2014it decays over centuries) The Saturation Threshold : Atmospheric Residue has a saturation point beyond which it stops absorbing efficiently: - Fresh Residue: Rapid absorption - Saturated Residue: Minimal absorption, slow re-radiation - Over-saturated conditions: Residue begins precipitating (K\u00f6d phenomenon) The Ancient Cooling Event : Climate models suggest that 40,000-50,000 years ago, a massive Residue release overwhelmed the planet's thermal budget: - Possible mass death event (war, plague, engineered catastrophe) - Possible Elsewhere incursion (Residue poured through from beyond) - Possible Loom activation (the system itself generated the initial Residue) - Result: Rapid cooling as net-negative cycle established - Current equilibrium: Death rate roughly balances decay/burning, maintaining cold Climate Engineering Implications : To warm a region : Harvest Residue aggressively, burn locally, prevent new deaths To cool a region : Allow Residue accumulation, prevent harvesting, increase death rate Current politics : Heartlands exports Residue (stays warm), imports death (wars elsewhere) The Middle Waters Exception : The Middle Waters maintain warmth through geothermal energy, not Residue burning: - Volcanic heat source independent of death-cycle - Lower historical death rate (smaller population, fewer wars) - Residue concentration naturally lower (warmth prevents precipitation) - Result: Uniquely independent from the dark bargain Summary Table Parameter Value Star S\u00e1rgvas, K-type orange dwarf Day Length 36 hours Year Length 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) Seasons 5: Csend (76d), Olvad\u00e1s (76d), L\u00e1ng (77d), Hanyatl\u00e1s (76d), K\u00f6d (45-46d) Axial Tilt ~20\u00b0 Orbital Eccentricity ~0.15 Moons 5 (L\u00e9lek, H\u00fas, K\u00f6tel, V\u00e9g, Fon\u00e1l) Temperature Range -70\u00b0C (polar Csend) to +20\u00b0C (Middle Waters L\u00e1ng) Landmasses 5 regions on multiple continents Special Feature K\u00f6d polar bleed (Elsewhere manifestation) Heat Source Pattern Residue burning (death as fuel) Further documentation needed on: Detailed regional maps, ocean currents, endemic species, atmospheric composition specifics, moon orbital mechanics, historical climate changes","title":"Planetary Parameters"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/planetary_parameters/#halcova-planetary-parameters","text":"","title":"H\u00e1lcova: Planetary Parameters"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/planetary_parameters/#the-star-sargvas-the-amber-eye","text":"Classification : K-type orange dwarf Color : Orange-amber Temperature : ~4,800K (cooler than Earth's sun) Age : ~7 billion years (stable, long-lived)","title":"The Star: S\u00e1rgvas (The Amber Eye)"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/planetary_parameters/#visual-effects","text":"Daylight : -

The energy absorbed during Residue formation exceeds the energy that can be released through burning. This is the fundamental mechanism behind H\u00e1lcova's cold. Phase 1: Formation (Death) When a pattern-bearing creature dies: - The pattern dissolves, releasing Residue - This dissolution process absorbs massive thermal energy from the environment - The energy absorbed is proportional to the pattern's \"weight\" (complexity, fate-significance) - A heavy pattern death can drop local temperature by several degrees - This heat becomes bound within the Residue's exotic matter structure Phase 2: Atmospheric Residue Unharvested Residue disperses into the environment: - Continues absorbing ambient heat (though more slowly than at formation) - Reaches saturation over time - Slowly re-radiates some energy, but absorption rate exceeds re-radiation - Net effect: persistent heat drain from environment Phase 3: Harvesting and Burning When Residue is collected and burned: - Releases stored thermal energy (useful heat) - Residue becomes \"spent\" or \"ash\"\u2014thermodynamically inert - Critical : Only ~60-70% of absorbed energy is recoverable through burning - The remaining 30-40% is permanently lost (converted to exotic matter decay, radiated as undetectable frequencies, or transferred to Elsewhere) The Net-Negative Result : Every death absorbs X thermal energy. Burning that death's Residue releases only 0.6-0.7X energy. The difference is permanently removed from H\u00e1lcova's thermal budget. Over millennia, this has cooled the world. The Feedback Loop : 1. Death releases Pattern Residue (absorbs heat) 2. Residue disperses, continues absorbing heat 3. Environment cools 4. Cold contributes to more death 5. More Residue released 6. Even with burning, net heat loss continues 7. Equilibrium reached when death rate balances Residue decay The Civilization Counter-Loop : - Harvested Residue provides useful heat (cities can be warm) - But harvesting doesn't recover all absorbed energy - Cities become warm islands surrounded by colder hinterlands - Residue trade flows from death-sites to population centers - The system requires constant death to maintain warmth Implications : - Civilization survives by burning death\u2014but it's thermodynamically inefficient - Peace reduces fuel supply AND allows ambient Residue to accumulate (cooling) - War produces Residue AND prevents accumulation through harvesting - The dark bargain: death makes the world cold, but burning death is the only warmth - Middle Waters' warmth comes from geothermal sources, not Residue\u2014making them uniquely independent - Polar regions are extreme because ancient mass death was never harvested, and the Residue saturated the environment","title":"Pattern Residue and Temperature"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/planetary_parameters/#the-five-seasons","text":"","title":"The Five Seasons"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/planetary_parameters/#year-structure","text":"Year Length : 350.667 local days (526 Earth days) Season Breakdown : - Csend (Silence): 76 days - Olvad\u00e1s (Thaw): 76 days - L\u00e1ng (Flame): 77 days - Hanyatl\u00e1s (Decline): 76 days - K\u00f6d (Veil): 45 or 46 days (see Long K\u00f6d cycle below) - Total : 350.667 days (average) The Long K\u00f6d Cycle : The fractional day accumulates across years.

Organized criminal enterprises fill gaps left by official systems, exploit pattern-based inequalities, and sometimes serve as the only recourse for those whom legal society has abandoned. Understanding H\u00e1lcova's criminal underworld illuminates the world's social fractures, economic pressures, and the limitations of official authority. The criminal economy represents approximately 5-10% of legitimate economic activity\u2014substantial enough to influence markets and politics, contained enough to avoid threatening system stability. This equilibrium reflects tacit accommodation between criminal organizations and authorities who find complete suppression neither possible nor desirable. Major Criminal Organizations The Silk Threads (Fonv\u00e1rs) The dominant criminal organization in the Heartlands capital operates with sophistication matching legitimate institutions. Structure and Leadership The Silk Threads employ a hierarchical structure of approximately 500 active members. At the apex sits the Weaver\u2014a position whose occupant's identity remains unknown to most members and all outsiders. The Weaver communicates through intermediaries, maintaining mystique that enhances authority and complicates law enforcement efforts. Below the Weaver, five Thread-Captains control distinct districts of Fonv\u00e1rs criminal territory: the Docks, the Lower Markets, the Warehouse Quarter, the Craftsmen's District, and the Entertainment District. Each Thread-Captain maintains significant autonomy within their territory while coordinating major operations through the Weaver's intermediaries. Thread-Captains command Knots\u2014groups of 10-20 enforcers who handle violence, collection, and territorial defense. Individual Knot leaders earn 1,000-3,000 marks annually; ordinary enforcers earn 500-1,500 marks. At the base, Loose Ends handle street-level crime: pickpocketing, small-scale theft, message running, and lookout duties. These individuals earn 50-300 marks annually and aspire to Knot membership. Primary Activities Protection Rackets : The Silk Threads' most reliable revenue stream. Businesses in controlled territories pay weekly fees (typically 5-10% of revenue) for \"protection\" from criminal activity\u2014protection that would otherwise come from the Silk Threads themselves. Annual protection revenue: approximately 150,000 marks. Smuggling : Contraband enters Fonv\u00e1rs through Silk Thread networks. Untaxed luxury goods, Threadist texts, illegal Elsewhere artifacts, and restricted substances move through warehouses and shops that appear legitimate. Smuggling revenue varies dramatically by year; average approximately 100,000 marks annually. Gambling Operations : Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally and serve customers who cannot access licensed establishments. House advantages and occasional rigging generate steady profits. Annual gambling revenue: approximately 75,000 marks. Prostitution : Unlicensed brothels operate throughout controlled territories. The Silk Threads provide protection to sex workers in exchange for substantial cuts of earnings. Revenue: approximately 50,000 marks annually. Pattern-Forgery : Perhaps the most lucrative per-transaction activity, the Silk Threads produce forged pattern-certificates allowing constrained individuals to access privileges reserved for higher pattern status. A quality forgery costs 500-5,000 marks; detection means execution for both forger and user. Annual forgery revenue: approximately 100,000 marks. Residue Theft : The most dangerous operation involves stealing Residue\u2014the essence left when pattern-bearing individuals die\u2014from Church collection or state storage. Residue has enormous value to certain buyers, but theft constitutes both crime and heresy. Revenue varies; major heists can net 50,000+ marks but occur rarely. Relationship with Authority The Silk Threads maintain corruption networks ensuring operational continuity. City Guard officers receive monthly payments (50-200 marks depending on rank and territory) for ignoring specific activities and providing warning of raids. Several mid-level Wardens accept payments for similar accommodation regarding pattern-crimes, though senior Wardens appear incorruptible. The Church's relationship with the Silk Threads is complex. Officially, the Church condemns all criminal activity. Unofficially, certain Church administrators purchase stolen Residue\u2014the commodity's value creates irresistible temptation. This hypocrisy provides the Silk Threads leverage against Church interference. Total Annual Revenue : Approximately 500,000 marks, making the Silk Threads economically comparable to a major noble house. The Coral Syndicate (Reaches) Maritime crime in the Reaches operates through the Coral Syndicate\u2014a decentralized network connecting criminal operations across major ports. Structure and Leadership Unlike the hierarchical Silk Threads, the Coral Syndicate functions as a confederation. Each major port has a Port Captain who controls local criminal activity autonomously. Port Captains answer to no central authority but coordinate through the Council of Tides\u2014periodic meetings where leaders negotiate disputes, share intelligence, and plan major operations. The loose structure reflects Reaches culture: independence, practical cooperation, and suspicion of concentrated authority. It also makes the Syndicate difficult to destroy\u2014eliminating one Port Captain merely creates opportunity for successors. Total Syndicate membership exceeds 1,000 individuals across all ports, though boundaries between members and associates blur significantly. Primary Activities Smuggling : The Syndicate's core business. Reaches geography\u2014extensive coastline, numerous ports, complex maritime traffic\u2014creates ideal smuggling conditions. Contraband includes untaxed goods avoiding Crown duties, prohibited items (Threadist materials, restricted substances, illegal weapons), and human cargo (fugitives fleeing pattern-enforcement, illegal immigrants, occasionally slaves despite official abolition). Smuggling operations range from small boats moving minor contraband to organized fleets running major cargo. A successful smuggling captain earns 2,000-10,000 marks annually; crew members earn 300-1,000 marks. Piracy : True piracy\u2014attacking legitimate merchant ships\u2014occurs but remains rarer than popular imagination suggests. Most \"piracy\" involves either organized intimidation (merchant captains paying \"passage fees\" to avoid trouble) or attacks on other criminal operations. When genuine piracy occurs, Syndicate ships target wealthy cargoes and avoid vessels likely to prompt aggressive response. Contraband Trade : The Syndicate connects producers and consumers of illegal goods throughout H\u00e1lcova. Drugs derived from Elsewhere-touched plants, stolen luxury items, weapons prohibited to pattern-constrained individuals\u2014the Syndicate moves these goods with efficiency rivaling legitimate merchants. Pattern-Evasion Assistance : Individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement\u2014those who refuse Correction, escape constrained labor, or commit pattern-crimes\u2014seek Syndicate assistance in reaching safety. Some flee to Far Shelf resistance communities; others seek new identities in distant ports. This service combines humanitarian impulse with substantial profit (1,000-10,000 marks depending on risk and destination). Relationship with Authority The Reaches League tolerates the Coral Syndicate because complete suppression would require resources the League prefers to spend elsewhere\u2014and because Syndicate activity generates economic benefits. Smuggled goods still circulate through Reaches markets; Syndicate spending supports local economies; and \"piracy\" that targets competitors more than League merchants creates perverse advantage. The Heartlands Crown opposes the Syndicate more actively but cannot project sufficient naval power to threaten Syndicate operations in Reaches waters. Border enforcement catches some smuggling; most passes through. Total Annual Revenue : Approximately 2,000,000 marks across all Syndicate operations\u2014making it the wealthiest criminal organization in H\u00e1lcova by substantial margin. The Hollow Saints (Far Shelf) Part criminal organization, part resistance movement, the Hollow Saints blur boundaries between crime and political opposition. Structure and Leadership The Hollow Saints operate in cells of 5-15 members, each largely independent. Cell leaders know contacts in one or two other cells; no one knows the complete organizational structure. This security through compartmentalization protects the organization from infiltration\u2014betrayal of one cell doesn't compromise others. Total active membership: 200-300 individuals. Support networks of sympathizers, safe houses, and occasional collaborators multiply effective strength significantly. Leadership operates by reputation and demonstrated commitment rather than formal hierarchy. The most respected members\u2014those who've survived longest, accomplished most, or sacrificed most\u2014command informal authority. Primary Activities Threadist Text Distribution : The Hollow Saints circulate writings the Church considers heretical\u2014philosophical arguments against pattern-determinism, histories presenting alternative accounts of the Integration Century, theological works questioning Church authority. Production occurs in hidden locations; distribution uses dead drops, trusted networks, and embedded codes. Pattern-Certificate Forgery : Unlike commercial forgers who sell to individual buyers, the Hollow Saints produce documents for resistance purposes: false identities for hunted members, papers allowing travel through controlled areas, certificates enabling access to restricted resources. Targeted Violence : The Hollow Saints assassinate Wardens and Church officials responsible for persecution of Threadist communities. Such killings are rare, carefully planned, and intended to impose costs on oppression rather than trigger mass violence. Between five and fifteen such attacks occur annually across the Far Shelf. Sabotage : Destruction targeting infrastructure supporting pattern-enforcement: Loom relay stations, Church record repositories, Warden command posts. Sabotage operations require significant planning and risk substantial casualties; they occur when strategic value justifies danger. Harboring Fugitives : Perhaps their most common activity, the Hollow Saints maintain networks of safe houses and escape routes for individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement. A fugitive reaching Hollow Saint contacts has reasonable probability of eventual safety in remote Far Shelf communities beyond effective central authority. Relationship with Authority The Hollow Saints are actively hunted. Wardens prioritize their destruction above other criminal targets. Church officials consider them heretics deserving execution. Crown authorities view them as rebels threatening social order. Despite decades of persecution, the Hollow Saints persist because Far Shelf geography complicates pursuit, local populations often sympathize with resistance, and new members replace those captured or killed. The cycle of persecution and resistance appears stable\u2014authorities cannot eliminate the Hollow Saints; the Hollow Saints cannot threaten regime survival. Funding and Economics Unlike commercial criminal organizations, the Hollow Saints don't pursue profit. Operating funds come from donations (both from committed supporters and from wealthy individuals hedging bets against regime change), occasional theft for operational needs, and contributions from Far Shelf communities that benefit from resistance activity. Individual members receive subsistence support rather than wages. Leadership distributes resources according to need and operational requirements. The organization's annual budget totals perhaps 50,000-100,000 marks\u2014modest compared to other organizations but sufficient for their purposes. The Consortium's Shadow (Vent Lands) Within the Flesh Shaping Consortium's legitimate operations lurk activities that, while technically legal, constitute organized harm. Structure Unlike traditional criminal organizations, the Consortium's Shadow has no separate existence from the legitimate Consortium. Rather, certain Consortium members and facilities engage in activities the organization officially prohibits while enjoying protection from official Consortium structure. Participation requires both Consortium membership and willingness to cross ethical lines. Perhaps 100-200 individuals participate directly; many more benefit indirectly or maintain willful ignorance. Activities Illegal Flesh Shaping Experiments : Consortium regulations restrict modifications that create unacceptable risk, cause unnecessary suffering, or produce results deemed socially harmful. Some practitioners ignore these restrictions, conducting experiments on subjects unable to refuse (prisoners sold by corrupt authorities, desperate poor individuals, kidnapping victims). Results include medical advances that eventually become legitimate and failed experiments disposed of quietly. Body Trafficking : The Consortium officially permits Flesh Shaping only on willing subjects with appropriate documentation. Underground operations modify individuals without consent\u2014typically creating workers, fighters, or pleasure servants for wealthy buyers. A modified slave can sell for 5,000-50,000 marks depending on modifications. Elsewhere Contact Research : Official Consortium position holds that direct Elsewhere contact is impossible and undesirable. Unofficial research pursues exactly such contact, seeking advantages from direct interaction with the alternate reality underlying pattern and Flesh Shaping. Results of this research remain closely held; rumors suggest both catastrophic failures and disturbing successes. Corporate Crimes : The legitimate Consortium engages in practices that, while legal, constitute harm: monopolistic pricing, suppression of competition, manipulation of regulatory bodies, blackmail of officials who threaten Consortium interests. These activities blur the line between aggressive business practice and organized crime. Protection and Impunity The Consortium's Shadow benefits from institutional protection unavailable to other criminal organizations. The legitimate Consortium's economic power and political influence shield members from prosecution. Internal discipline handles problems without external investigation. Even Wardens hesitate to pursue cases against Consortium members with powerful allies. This protection is not absolute\u2014egregious violations can trigger response, and enemies within the Consortium may use Shadow activities against rivals. But the margin for misconduct is substantially wider than that enjoyed by ordinary criminals. Criminal Activity Categories Smuggling Contraband movement constitutes the largest criminal activity by economic volume. Goods Smuggled Threadist texts and other prohibited materials enter H\u00e1lcova through Reaches ports, hidden in legitimate cargo or carried by dedicated smuggling vessels. Distribution networks move materials to final consumers. Illegal Elsewhere artifacts\u2014objects created through or affected by Elsewhere contact\u2014command high prices among collectors and practitioners seeking power outside official channels. Most such \"artifacts\" are frauds; genuine items are extraordinarily rare and dangerous. Untaxed luxury goods avoid Crown duties that add 20-40% to legitimate prices. Wine, fine textiles, exotic foods, and quality metalwork all move through smuggling channels. Restricted substances\u2014drugs derived from Elsewhere-touched plants, compounds with magical properties, addictive materials prohibited for social control\u2014reach consumers through smuggling networks. Human Smuggling Pattern-fugitives fleeing Correction or constrained labor seek passage to safety. Smugglers charge 1,000-10,000 marks depending on risk and destination. Success rates vary; captured fugitives face execution, captured smugglers face severe punishment. Illegal immigration\u2014people seeking to enter H\u00e1lcova or move between regions without documentation\u2014uses similar channels at lower prices. The slave trade, officially abolished throughout H\u00e1lcova, persists through criminal networks. Victims include war captives from border conflicts, debtors sold by creditors, and kidnapping victims. Slaves move through the same channels as other contraband. Pattern-Crimes Crimes against the pattern system carry extraordinary penalties and generate extraordinary profits. Certificate Forgery Quality pattern-certificate forgery requires specialized skills: knowledge of official document formats, access to appropriate materials, ability to create convincing verification marks. Professional forgers charge 500-5,000 marks per certificate; amateurs produce documents likely to fail inspection. Detection rates for quality forgeries remain low\u2014perhaps 10-20% of forged certificates eventually trigger investigation. The penalty for both forger and user is execution, creating strong incentive for quality work and careful use. Pattern-Reading Fraud Fraudulent fortune-tellers claim ability to perceive pattern information they cannot actually access. This crime against both individual victims and pattern system integrity carries Correction as standard penalty. More sophisticated fraud involves false interpretation of genuine pattern information\u2014readers who can perceive patterns but deliberately misinterpret them for profit. Detection is nearly impossible without catching the fraudster in explicit deception. Loom Manipulation Attempts Attempts to manipulate the Loom itself\u2014to alter fate rather than merely predict it\u2014constitute the most serious pattern-crime. Success is extraordinarily rare; most attempts produce no effect, trigger dangerous backlash, or attract Warden attention. Those caught attempting Loom manipulation face execution after extensive interrogation. The possibility of actual Loom manipulation drives both criminal enterprise and enforcement intensity. If fate itself could be bought, current social order becomes meaningless. This existential threat justifies extreme measures. Soul Procurement and Substitution Trafficking The darkest criminal enterprise on H\u00e1lcova: acquiring pattern-weighted individuals for pact substitution. The Market Demand Pact Summoners owe entities payment in pattern-weight. They can pay with their own cores, or they can substitute others. Entities don't care whose pattern they consume\u2014only that it has sufficient weight. This creates demand for heavy patterns that far exceeds voluntary supply. The wealthy don't sell themselves. The desperate poor have light patterns. The gap between demand and willing supply is filled by coercion. Procurement Methods Kidnapping Operations : Organized crews identify heavy-pattern individuals (the pattern-privileged, successful merchants, minor nobility) and abduct them. Targets are held in secure locations until sold to entity-brokers. A successful kidnapping operation might net 10,000-50,000 marks for a truly heavy pattern. Security details exist specifically to prevent this. Some security personnel have been known to turn on their employers when the price is right. Debt Conversion : When pattern-privileged individuals fall into debt, creditors sometimes accept substitution rights as collateral. If the debt isn't repaid, the creditor can sell those rights. This is legal in most jurisdictions\u2014a debt is a debt. Criminal organizations purchase distressed debt specifically to acquire substitution rights. Family Sales : Some families sell members\u2014usually younger children with heavy patterns, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Gray-market in most jurisdictions, openly legal in a few. Brokers specialize in facilitating these transactions, providing discretion and documentation. Death Row Speculation : Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. The state auctions substitution rights for serious crimes. Speculators buy these rights and resell to summoners. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more than light-pattern ones\u2014creating incentives to ensure heavy-pattern individuals commit capital crimes. The Broker Networks Specialized intermediaries connect supply and demand: Matchmakers : Identify summoners with approaching payment deadlines and match them with available substitutes. Charge 10-20% of transaction value. Holders : Maintain secure facilities where kidnapped individuals are held pending sale. Charge per-day fees plus percentage of eventual sale. Transporters : Move substitutes from procurement to holding to final delivery. Critical for maintaining chain of custody and preventing escape or rescue. Legitimizers : Produce documentation making coerced substitution appear voluntary. Forged consent documents, fabricated debt records, falsified family authorization. Pricing Substitution prices reflect procurement difficulty, not pattern-weight alone: Category Typical Price Notes Light pattern, voluntary 50-500 marks Abundant supply, limited demand Medium pattern, voluntary 500-2,000 marks Some demand for routine pacts Medium pattern, coerced 2,000-5,000 marks Procurement costs included Heavy pattern, coerced 5,000-20,000 marks Significant risk premium Exceptional pattern 20,000-100,000 marks Rare, dangerous acquisition Law Enforcement Substitution trafficking occupies a legal gray zone: Voluntary substitution is legal (if documented) Kidnapping is illegal, but proving the connection to substitution is difficult Debt conversion is legal (contract law) Family sales vary by jurisdiction Entities don't testify about where their patterns came from Wardens investigate pattern-trafficking when it intersects their mandate\u2014forced substitution violates pattern-integrity. But enforcement is selective. Heavy resources go to protecting the pattern-privileged; pattern-constrained victims receive less attention. The Silk Threads operate procurement networks in Fonv\u00e1rs. The Coral Syndicate moves substitutes between regions. Even the Consortium's Shadow engages in body trafficking that sometimes ends in substitution rather than modified slavery. The Moral Horror This is a literal soul trade. The purchased individual will have their core consumed by an Elsewhere entity. They will die without residue, without the possibility of echo-binding, without any continuation. They will simply cease. And yet the market exists because the demand exists because pacts exist because Elsewhere exists. The horror isn't that evil people do evil things\u2014it's that the system creates the incentives and the transactions follow. Violence Criminal violence ranges from individual attacks to organized warfare. Contract Killing Professional killers available through criminal networks charge rates based on target difficulty. A vulnerable pattern-constrained individual might cost 100-500 marks. A protected merchant costs 1,000-5,000 marks. A minor noble or official costs 5,000-15,000 marks. Killing a major figure\u2014high noble, senior Church official, prominent Warden\u2014requires 20,000+ marks and may simply be refused as too dangerous. Success rates for professional killers exceed 80% for accessible targets, dropping significantly for protected individuals. Investigation intensity following killings varies with victim status\u2014pattern-constrained deaths often go uninvestigated. Protection Violence Criminal organizations maintain territory through demonstrated willingness to use violence. Businesses that refuse protection payments suffer arson, assault, or destruction of goods. Rival criminals who encroach on territory face assault, maiming, or death. This violence is usually instrumental rather than sadistic\u2014enough to establish credibility, not so much as to trigger authority response. The most successful criminal organizations minimize violence while maximizing fear. Gang Warfare Conflicts between criminal organizations occasionally escalate to open warfare. Territory disputes, personal vendettas, and competition for lucrative operations can trigger sustained violence. Such conflicts attract authority attention and usually end through negotiation once costs exceed benefits. Warden Assassination Killing Wardens represents the most dangerous violent crime. Wardens protect each other, investigate murders intensively, and impose collective punishment on communities harboring assassins. Successful Warden assassination requires exceptional skill, planning, and luck\u2014or willingness to sacrifice the killer. The Hollow Saints conduct most Warden assassinations. Commercial assassination of Wardens is theoretically possible but practically rare\u2014the risks and costs exceed what most clients will pay. Vice Criminal provision of pleasure follows predictable patterns. Illegal Gambling Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally (higher stakes, forbidden betting targets, rigged outcomes) and access unavailable legally (pattern-constrained individuals excluded from licensed establishments). House profits come from standard gambling advantages plus occasional manipulation. Losers who cannot pay face violence or debt bondage. Unlicensed Prostitution Legal prostitution requires licensing, inspection, and substantial fees. Unlicensed operations avoid these costs while accepting risks: violence from customers without legal protection, disease without mandatory medical checks, exploitation by criminal organizations providing \"protection.\" Most unlicensed sex workers are pattern-constrained individuals with limited economic alternatives. Some choose the work; others are coerced or trafficked. Drug Trade Substances derived from Elsewhere-touched plants or created through restricted processes circulate through criminal networks. Effects vary: some merely intoxicate, others enable perception of pattern information, others facilitate Flesh Shaping or other magical effects. Prices range from 1-5 marks for common intoxicants to 100+ marks for rare substances with magical properties. Addiction creates reliable customers; overdose deaths create investigatory problems. Theft Property crime ranges from opportunistic to organized. Residue Theft Stealing Residue\u2014the essence of dead pattern-bearers\u2014combines extraordinary value with extraordinary risk. Residue has legitimate uses in Church ritual and Loom maintenance; it also has prohibited uses including Elsewhere contact attempts and Flesh Shaping enhancement. Thieves target Residue during collection (immediately after death), transportation (moving from death site to Church storage), or storage (Church facilities, state repositories). Each presents different challenges and risks. Successful Residue theft can yield 10,000-100,000 marks depending on quantity and quality. Detection and capture yields execution after torture for information about buyers and methods. Art and Artifact Theft Wealthy H\u00e1lcovans accumulate valuable objects that can be stolen and sold. Pattern-woven tapestries, religious artifacts, historical items, and fine art all have criminal markets. Theft from noble houses requires overcoming security\u2014guards, locks, and sometimes magical protections. Theft from Church facilities adds heresy to property crime. Successful thieves either have specific buyers arranged or sell through criminal networks at substantial discounts. Cargo Theft Goods in transit\u2014whether overland by wagon or maritime by ship\u2014present theft opportunities. Pirates attack ships; bandits attack wagon trains; dock workers pilfer cargo during loading and unloading. Most cargo theft involves ordinary goods resold at discount. High-value cargo (expensive manufactures, restricted materials) attracts more sophisticated theft with correspondingly higher risks and rewards. Law Enforcement Response City Guard Urban police forces handle ordinary crime: theft, assault, public disorder, and minor vice. Guard effectiveness varies by city, district, and individual officer. In practice, City Guards focus on crimes affecting pattern-privileged individuals and major disruptions to public order. Pattern-constrained victims often find Guards uninterested in investigation. Corruption is endemic\u2014Guards supplement inadequate salaries with payments from criminals, victims, and both simultaneously. Guards investigating organized crime face limited resources, active obstruction, and personal danger. Most focus on manageable problems rather than challenging powerful criminal organizations. Wardens The Warden Order prioritizes pattern-crimes: certificate forgery, Loom manipulation attempts, and crimes by or against Elsewhere-touched individuals. Ordinary crime falls outside their mandate except when it intersects pattern concerns. Wardens bring superior resources, training, and determination to investigations within their scope. Criminal organizations avoid triggering Warden interest when possible; those who attract Warden attention face serious consequences. However, Warden capacity is limited. They cannot investigate every pattern-crime, cannot operate everywhere simultaneously, and cannot entirely overcome corrupt officials who protect criminal operations. Wardens are a threat to criminal enterprise, not an absolute barrier. Church Authorities Church investigation focuses on heresy and Residue theft. Crimes without religious dimension rarely attract Church attention; crimes threatening Church interests bring intensive response. Church investigators have access to resources\u2014including pattern-readers and Elsewhere-touched individuals\u2014unavailable to secular authorities. They also operate under different legal constraints, sometimes extracting confessions through methods secular courts would reject. Criminal organizations selling Threadist materials or stolen Residue face dual threats: secular criminal prosecution and Church heresy proceedings. The latter often proves more dangerous. Private Security Wealthy individuals and organizations hire private protection ranging from individual bodyguards to armed companies. This creates two-tier crime response: those who can afford protection receive it; those who cannot rely on inadequate public systems. Private security sometimes cooperates with criminal organizations\u2014purchasing immunity rather than fighting threats. The line between private security and criminal enforcement blurs in some contexts. Criminal Codes Major criminal organizations maintain internal rules governing member behavior. Silk Thread Code Members of the Silk Threads follow rules enforced by internal discipline: No killing civilians without permission from Thread-Captains. Unauthorized violence attracts attention and disrupts operations. Violators face punishment ranging from fines to execution depending on consequences. Pay tribute to the Weaver. All operations contribute percentage of profits upward through the hierarchy. Failure to pay brings escalating pressure culminating in removal from the organization\u2014often violently. Protect territory. Members defend assigned areas against rival criminals and maintain order ensuring continued profitable operation. Abandoning territory without permission constitutes serious offense. No cooperation with authorities. Informants face death\u2014slowly, publicly, and as warning to others. Even members arrested and tortured are expected to reveal nothing. Coral Syndicate Code The Syndicate's decentralized structure produces looser rules: Honor contracts. Agreements between members are binding. Violation destroys reputation necessary for continued operation. The Council of Tides arbitrates disputes and punishes contract breakers. Share intelligence. Information affecting multiple Port Captains must be shared. Hoarding valuable intelligence violates the confederation's foundation. Don't betray Port Captains. Whatever conflicts exist within the Syndicate, external threats to Port Captains affect all. Members who cooperate with authorities against Port Captains face universal condemnation. Hollow Saint Code The resistance movement's code reflects political rather than commercial priorities: Protect Threadists. The organization exists to defend those persecuted for belief. Members risk themselves before risking protected individuals. Target only oppressors. Violence against uninvolved civilians violates organizational principles and provides propaganda for enemies. Even in operations against legitimate targets, civilian casualties must be minimized. No innocent casualties. Operations likely to harm bystanders require exceptional justification. Members accept mission failure rather than innocent deaths when possible. Accept martyrdom if necessary. Captured members are expected to reveal nothing regardless of torture. Many carry means of suicide to ensure silence. Integration with Legitimate Society Criminal organizations don't exist separate from legitimate H\u00e1lcova\u2014they're embedded within it, exploiting gaps and contradictions in official systems. Pattern-constrained individuals denied legal economic opportunity find criminal employment. Goods and services prohibited by law but desired by markets reach consumers through criminal channels. Corruption connects criminal operations to legitimate authorities. This integration makes criminal activity extraordinarily difficult to eliminate. Suppressing one organization creates opportunity for others. Removing corrupt officials proves temporary as successors face the same pressures. Prohibiting goods and services creates the criminal markets that supply them. For narrative purposes, criminal organizations provide characters operating outside legal constraints but within comprehensible structures. Crime bosses, smugglers, resistance fighters, and corrupt officials all inhabit spaces defined by both criminal and legitimate rules\u2014spaces where stories of loyalty, betrayal, survival, and moral complexity naturally unfold. Further documentation needed: specific criminal figures and their histories, maps of criminal territories, detailed economics of particular criminal operations, investigation and prosecution procedures.","title":"Criminal Underworld"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#criminal-underworld-of-halcova","text":"","title":"Criminal Underworld of H\u00e1lcova"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#overview","text":"Crime in H\u00e1lcova exists in complex relationship with legitimate power structures.

The criminal economy represents approximately 5-10% of legitimate economic activity\u2014substantial enough to influence markets and politics, contained enough to avoid threatening system stability. This equilibrium reflects tacit accommodation between criminal organizations and authorities who find complete suppression neither possible nor desirable.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#major-criminal-organizations","text":"","title":"Major Criminal Organizations"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#the-silk-threads-fonvars","text":"The dominant criminal organization in the Heartlands capital operates with sophistication matching legitimate institutions. Structure and Leadership The Silk Threads employ a hierarchical structure of approximately 500 active members. At the apex sits the Weaver\u2014a position whose occupant's identity remains unknown to most members and all outsiders. The Weaver communicates through intermediaries, maintaining mystique that enhances authority and complicates law enforcement efforts. Below the Weaver, five Thread-Captains control distinct districts of Fonv\u00e1rs criminal territory: the Docks, the Lower Markets, the Warehouse Quarter, the Craftsmen's District, and the Entertainment District. Each Thread-Captain maintains significant autonomy within their territory while coordinating major operations through the Weaver's intermediaries. Thread-Captains command Knots\u2014groups of 10-20 enforcers who handle violence, collection, and territorial defense. Individual Knot leaders earn 1,000-3,000 marks annually; ordinary enforcers earn 500-1,500 marks. At the base, Loose Ends handle street-level crime: pickpocketing, small-scale theft, message running, and lookout duties. These individuals earn 50-300 marks annually and aspire to Knot membership. Primary Activities Protection Rackets : The Silk Threads' most reliable revenue stream. Businesses in controlled territories pay weekly fees (typically 5-10% of revenue) for \"protection\" from criminal activity\u2014protection that would otherwise come from the Silk Threads themselves. Annual protection revenue: approximately 150,000 marks. Smuggling : Contraband enters Fonv\u00e1rs through Silk Thread networks. Untaxed luxury goods, Threadist texts, illegal Elsewhere artifacts, and restricted substances move through warehouses and shops that appear legitimate. Smuggling revenue varies dramatically by year; average approximately 100,000 marks annually. Gambling Operations : Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally and serve customers who cannot access licensed establishments. House advantages and occasional rigging generate steady profits. Annual gambling revenue: approximately 75,000 marks. Prostitution : Unlicensed brothels operate throughout controlled territories. The Silk Threads provide protection to sex workers in exchange for substantial cuts of earnings. Revenue: approximately 50,000 marks annually. Pattern-Forgery : Perhaps the most lucrative per-transaction activity, the Silk Threads produce forged pattern-certificates allowing constrained individuals to access privileges reserved for higher pattern status. A quality forgery costs 500-5,000 marks; detection means execution for both forger and user. Annual forgery revenue: approximately 100,000 marks. Residue Theft : The most dangerous operation involves stealing Residue\u2014the essence left when pattern-bearing individuals die\u2014from Church collection or state storage. Residue has enormous value to certain buyers, but theft constitutes both crime and heresy. Revenue varies; major heists can net 50,000+ marks but occur rarely. Relationship with Authority The Silk Threads maintain corruption networks ensuring operational continuity. City Guard officers receive monthly payments (50-200 marks depending on rank and territory) for ignoring specific activities and providing warning of raids. Several mid-level Wardens accept payments for similar accommodation regarding pattern-crimes, though senior Wardens appear incorruptible. The Church's relationship with the Silk Threads is complex. Officially, the Church condemns all criminal activity. Unofficially, certain Church administrators purchase stolen Residue\u2014the commodity's value creates irresistible temptation. This hypocrisy provides the Silk Threads leverage against Church interference. Total Annual Revenue : Approximately 500,000 marks, making the Silk Threads economically comparable to a major noble house.","title":"The Silk Threads (Fonv\u00e1rs)"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#the-coral-syndicate-reaches","text":"Maritime crime in the Reaches operates through the Coral Syndicate\u2014a decentralized network connecting criminal operations across major ports. Structure and Leadership Unlike the hierarchical Silk Threads, the Coral Syndicate functions as a confederation. Each major port has a Port Captain who controls local criminal activity autonomously. Port Captains answer to no central authority but coordinate through the Council of Tides\u2014periodic meetings where leaders negotiate disputes, share intelligence, and plan major operations. The loose structure reflects Reaches culture: independence, practical cooperation, and suspicion of concentrated authority. It also makes the Syndicate difficult to destroy\u2014eliminating one Port Captain merely creates opportunity for successors. Total Syndicate membership exceeds 1,000 individuals across all ports, though boundaries between members and associates blur significantly. Primary Activities Smuggling : The Syndicate's core business. Reaches geography\u2014extensive coastline, numerous ports, complex maritime traffic\u2014creates ideal smuggling conditions. Contraband includes untaxed goods avoiding Crown duties, prohibited items (Threadist materials, restricted substances, illegal weapons), and human cargo (fugitives fleeing pattern-enforcement, illegal immigrants, occasionally slaves despite official abolition). Smuggling operations range from small boats moving minor contraband to organized fleets running major cargo. A successful smuggling captain earns 2,000-10,000 marks annually; crew members earn 300-1,000 marks. Piracy : True piracy\u2014attacking legitimate merchant ships\u2014occurs but remains rarer than popular imagination suggests. Most \"piracy\" involves either organized intimidation (merchant captains paying \"passage fees\" to avoid trouble) or attacks on other criminal operations. When genuine piracy occurs, Syndicate ships target wealthy cargoes and avoid vessels likely to prompt aggressive response. Contraband Trade : The Syndicate connects producers and consumers of illegal goods throughout H\u00e1lcova. Drugs derived from Elsewhere-touched plants, stolen luxury items, weapons prohibited to pattern-constrained individuals\u2014the Syndicate moves these goods with efficiency rivaling legitimate merchants. Pattern-Evasion Assistance : Individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement\u2014those who refuse Correction, escape constrained labor, or commit pattern-crimes\u2014seek Syndicate assistance in reaching safety. Some flee to Far Shelf resistance communities; others seek new identities in distant ports. This service combines humanitarian impulse with substantial profit (1,000-10,000 marks depending on risk and destination). Relationship with Authority The Reaches League tolerates the Coral Syndicate because complete suppression would require resources the League prefers to spend elsewhere\u2014and because Syndicate activity generates economic benefits. Smuggled goods still circulate through Reaches markets; Syndicate spending supports local economies; and \"piracy\" that targets competitors more than League merchants creates perverse advantage. The Heartlands Crown opposes the Syndicate more actively but cannot project sufficient naval power to threaten Syndicate operations in Reaches waters. Border enforcement catches some smuggling; most passes through. Total Annual Revenue : Approximately 2,000,000 marks across all Syndicate operations\u2014making it the wealthiest criminal organization in H\u00e1lcova by substantial margin.","title":"The Coral Syndicate (Reaches)"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#the-hollow-saints-far-shelf","text":"Part criminal organization, part resistance movement, the Hollow Saints blur boundaries between crime and political opposition. Structure and Leadership The Hollow Saints operate in cells of 5-15 members, each largely independent. Cell leaders know contacts in one or two other cells; no one knows the complete organizational structure. This security through compartmentalization protects the organization from infiltration\u2014betrayal of one cell doesn't compromise others. Total active membership: 200-300 individuals. Support networks of sympathizers, safe houses, and occasional collaborators multiply effective strength significantly. Leadership operates by reputation and demonstrated commitment rather than formal hierarchy. The most respected members\u2014those who've survived longest, accomplished most, or sacrificed most\u2014command informal authority. Primary Activities Threadist Text Distribution : The Hollow Saints circulate writings the Church considers heretical\u2014philosophical arguments against pattern-determinism, histories presenting alternative accounts of the Integration Century, theological works questioning Church authority. Production occurs in hidden locations; distribution uses dead drops, trusted networks, and embedded codes. Pattern-Certificate Forgery : Unlike commercial forgers who sell to individual buyers, the Hollow Saints produce documents for resistance purposes: false identities for hunted members, papers allowing travel through controlled areas, certificates enabling access to restricted resources. Targeted Violence : The Hollow Saints assassinate Wardens and Church officials responsible for persecution of Threadist communities. Such killings are rare, carefully planned, and intended to impose costs on oppression rather than trigger mass violence. Between five and fifteen such attacks occur annually across the Far Shelf. Sabotage : Destruction targeting infrastructure supporting pattern-enforcement: Loom relay stations, Church record repositories, Warden command posts. Sabotage operations require significant planning and risk substantial casualties; they occur when strategic value justifies danger. Harboring Fugitives : Perhaps their most common activity, the Hollow Saints maintain networks of safe houses and escape routes for individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement. A fugitive reaching Hollow Saint contacts has reasonable probability of eventual safety in remote Far Shelf communities beyond effective central authority. Relationship with Authority The Hollow Saints are actively hunted. Wardens prioritize their destruction above other criminal targets. Church officials consider them heretics deserving execution. Crown authorities view them as rebels threatening social order. Despite decades of persecution, the Hollow Saints persist because Far Shelf geography complicates pursuit, local populations often sympathize with resistance, and new members replace those captured or killed. The cycle of persecution and resistance appears stable\u2014authorities cannot eliminate the Hollow Saints; the Hollow Saints cannot threaten regime survival. Funding and Economics Unlike commercial criminal organizations, the Hollow Saints don't pursue profit. Operating funds come from donations (both from committed supporters and from wealthy individuals hedging bets against regime change), occasional theft for operational needs, and contributions from Far Shelf communities that benefit from resistance activity. Individual members receive subsistence support rather than wages. Leadership distributes resources according to need and operational requirements. The organization's annual budget totals perhaps 50,000-100,000 marks\u2014modest compared to other organizations but sufficient for their purposes.","title":"The Hollow Saints (Far Shelf)"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#the-consortiums-shadow-vent-lands","text":"Within the Flesh Shaping Consortium's legitimate operations lurk activities that, while technically legal, constitute organized harm.

The desperate poor have light patterns. The gap between demand and willing supply is filled by coercion. Procurement Methods Kidnapping Operations : Organized crews identify heavy-pattern individuals (the pattern-privileged, successful merchants, minor nobility) and abduct them. Targets are held in secure locations until sold to entity-brokers. A successful kidnapping operation might net 10,000-50,000 marks for a truly heavy pattern. Security details exist specifically to prevent this. Some security personnel have been known to turn on their employers when the price is right. Debt Conversion : When pattern-privileged individuals fall into debt, creditors sometimes accept substitution rights as collateral. If the debt isn't repaid, the creditor can sell those rights. This is legal in most jurisdictions\u2014a debt is a debt. Criminal organizations purchase distressed debt specifically to acquire substitution rights. Family Sales : Some families sell members\u2014usually younger children with heavy patterns, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Gray-market in most jurisdictions, openly legal in a few. Brokers specialize in facilitating these transactions, providing discretion and documentation. Death Row Speculation : Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. The state auctions substitution rights for serious crimes. Speculators buy these rights and resell to summoners. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more than light-pattern ones\u2014creating incentives to ensure heavy-pattern individuals commit capital crimes. The Broker Networks Specialized intermediaries connect supply and demand: Matchmakers : Identify summoners with approaching payment deadlines and match them with available substitutes. Charge 10-20% of transaction value. Holders : Maintain secure facilities where kidnapped individuals are held pending sale. Charge per-day fees plus percentage of eventual sale. Transporters : Move substitutes from procurement to holding to final delivery. Critical for maintaining chain of custody and preventing escape or rescue. Legitimizers : Produce documentation making coerced substitution appear voluntary. Forged consent documents, fabricated debt records, falsified family authorization. Pricing Substitution prices reflect procurement difficulty, not pattern-weight alone: Category Typical Price Notes Light pattern, voluntary 50-500 marks Abundant supply, limited demand Medium pattern, voluntary 500-2,000 marks Some demand for routine pacts Medium pattern, coerced 2,000-5,000 marks Procurement costs included Heavy pattern, coerced 5,000-20,000 marks Significant risk premium Exceptional pattern 20,000-100,000 marks Rare, dangerous acquisition Law Enforcement Substitution trafficking occupies a legal gray zone: Voluntary substitution is legal (if documented) Kidnapping is illegal, but proving the connection to substitution is difficult Debt conversion is legal (contract law) Family sales vary by jurisdiction Entities don't testify about where their patterns came from Wardens investigate pattern-trafficking when it intersects their mandate\u2014forced substitution violates pattern-integrity. But enforcement is selective. Heavy resources go to protecting the pattern-privileged; pattern-constrained victims receive less attention. The Silk Threads operate procurement networks in Fonv\u00e1rs. The Coral Syndicate moves substitutes between regions. Even the Consortium's Shadow engages in body trafficking that sometimes ends in substitution rather than modified slavery. The Moral Horror This is a literal soul trade. The purchased individual will have their core consumed by an Elsewhere entity. They will die without residue, without the possibility of echo-binding, without any continuation. They will simply cease. And yet the market exists because the demand exists because pacts exist because Elsewhere exists. The horror isn't that evil people do evil things\u2014it's that the system creates the incentives and the transactions follow.","title":"Soul Procurement and Substitution Trafficking"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#violence","text":"Criminal violence ranges from individual attacks to organized warfare. Contract Killing Professional killers available through criminal networks charge rates based on target difficulty. A vulnerable pattern-constrained individual might cost 100-500 marks. A protected merchant costs 1,000-5,000 marks. A minor noble or official costs 5,000-15,000 marks. Killing a major figure\u2014high noble, senior Church official, prominent Warden\u2014requires 20,000+ marks and may simply be refused as too dangerous. Success rates for professional killers exceed 80% for accessible targets, dropping significantly for protected individuals. Investigation intensity following killings varies with victim status\u2014pattern-constrained deaths often go uninvestigated. Protection Violence Criminal organizations maintain territory through demonstrated willingness to use violence. Businesses that refuse protection payments suffer arson, assault, or destruction of goods. Rival criminals who encroach on territory face assault, maiming, or death. This violence is usually instrumental rather than sadistic\u2014enough to establish credibility, not so much as to trigger authority response. The most successful criminal organizations minimize violence while maximizing fear. Gang Warfare Conflicts between criminal organizations occasionally escalate to open warfare. Territory disputes, personal vendettas, and competition for lucrative operations can trigger sustained violence. Such conflicts attract authority attention and usually end through negotiation once costs exceed benefits. Warden Assassination Killing Wardens represents the most dangerous violent crime. Wardens protect each other, investigate murders intensively, and impose collective punishment on communities harboring assassins. Successful Warden assassination requires exceptional skill, planning, and luck\u2014or willingness to sacrifice the killer. The Hollow Saints conduct most Warden assassinations. Commercial assassination of Wardens is theoretically possible but practically rare\u2014the risks and costs exceed what most clients will pay.","title":"Violence"},{"location":"halcova/society/criminal_underworld/#vice","text":"Criminal provision of pleasure follows predictable patterns. Illegal Gambling Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally (higher stakes, forbidden betting targets, rigged outcomes) and access unavailable legally (pattern-constrained individuals excluded from licensed establishments).

Unlicensed Prostitution Legal prostitution requires licensing, inspection, and substantial fees. Unlicensed operations avoid these costs while accepting risks: violence from customers without legal protection, disease without mandatory medical checks, exploitation by criminal organizations providing \"protection.\" Most unlicensed sex workers are pattern-constrained individuals with limited economic alternatives. Some choose the work; others are coerced or trafficked. Drug Trade Substances derived from Elsewhere-touched plants or created through restricted processes circulate through criminal networks. Effects vary: some merely intoxicate, others enable perception of pattern information, others facilitate Flesh Shaping or other magical effects.

Thieves target Residue during collection (immediately after death), transportation (moving from death site to Church storage), or storage (Church facilities, state repositories). Each presents different challenges and risks. Successful Residue theft can yield 10,000-100,000 marks depending on quantity and quality. Detection and capture yields execution after torture for information about buyers and methods. Art and Artifact Theft Wealthy H\u00e1lcovans accumulate valuable objects that can be stolen and sold. Pattern-woven tapestries, religious artifacts, historical items, and fine art all have criminal markets. Theft from noble houses requires overcoming security\u2014guards, locks, and sometimes magical protections. Theft from Church facilities adds heresy to property crime. Successful thieves either have specific buyers arranged or sell through criminal networks at substantial discounts.

The S\u00f3rscad pattern determines access to credit, employment, insurance, and opportunity. Pattern Residue\u2014the energy of dissolving fates\u2014fuels magic and industry. Death is literally productive. This creates an economy where some people are worth more dead than alive, where peace is expensive, and where the institutions that predict your future have financial stakes in that prediction coming true. The Fate Market Pattern as Asset Your S\u00f3rscad is not just identity\u2014it's capital. Pattern-Weight Some patterns are \"heavier\" than others: - More fate-significance - More likely to impact events - More valuable as Pattern Residue when released Heavy patterns belong to: - Those born into consequential circumstances - Those whose choices ripple outward - Those predicted for significant outcomes (positive or negative) Light patterns belong to: - Those born into marginal circumstances - Those whose choices affect few others - Those predicted for unremarkable outcomes The Market Implications Heavy patterns command higher prices in substitution deals (Pact Summoning) Heavy patterns produce more valuable Residue upon death Heavy patterns are worth more to The Loom (more data value) Heavy patterns are targets for various exploitation This creates a hierarchy: some lives have more market value than others, calculated and priced. Pattern Speculation Fate Futures Financial instruments that pay out based on whether predictions come true: \"If subject achieves predicted career trajectory by age 30, contract pays X\" \"If subject dies by predicted cause within predicted window, contract pays Y\" \"If subject deviates significantly from pattern, contract is void\" Who Trades These Insurance companies (hedging their risk assessments) Investment houses (speculating on populations) Criminal organizations (betting on specific outcomes they can influence) Governments (managing demographic predictions) Pattern Arbitrage Some patterns are mispriced. The Loom's predictions, while accurate on average, have errors in individual cases. Arbitrageurs look for: - Patterns undervalued by The Loom (capable people dismissed as low-potential) - Patterns overvalued by The Loom (impressive readings masking actual mediocrity) - Situations where environmental change will shift pattern-outcomes They invest in undervalued people\u2014education, opportunity, resources\u2014and profit when those people outperform predictions. This is legal. It's also morally ambiguous: you're betting on people, treating lives as investments, profiting from the gap between predicted and actual humanity. Credit and Debt Pattern-Based Lending All credit decisions incorporate S\u00f3rscad data: Interest Rates Pattern-privileged: Low rates. The Loom predicts they'll repay. Pattern-constrained: High rates. The Loom predicts elevated default risk. Pattern-illegible (practitioners): Variable. Their patterns are too contaminated for reliable prediction. Collateral What can you pledge? Physical assets (traditional) Future earnings (income garnishment) Pattern Residue rights (if you die, the lender harvests) Pact-substitution rights (you can be offered to an Elsewhere entity) Echo-binding rights (you can be bound after death) The last three are where lending gets dark. Poor borrowers often have nothing to pledge but themselves\u2014their deaths, their souls, their eternal servitude as echoes. Debt Spirals The pattern-constrained start with high rates, struggle to repay, take on more debt to service existing debt, and eventually pledge increasingly extreme collateral. Endpoint possibilities: - Debt-bondage (working off the debt under contract) - Residue-pledge (worth more dead than alive) - Pact-transfer (sold to cover what you owe) - Echo-indenture (bound to serve after death) The system is designed to produce these endpoints. They're not failures of the system\u2014they're the system working as intended. The Pact Economy Elsewhere Entities as Lenders Pact Summoning functions like supernatural credit: - You receive power now - You pay with your core later - Interest accrues (the more you use, the faster you pay) - Default is impossible (the entity always collects) Substitution as Currency Cores are fungible. The entity doesn't care whose core it gets. This creates: - Substitution markets : Where cores are bought and sold - Core brokers : Middlemen connecting those with cores to sell and summoners needing payment - Substitution pricing : Heavy patterns worth more, light patterns worth less - Procurement operations : Acquiring cores through various means (legal and otherwise) The Substitution Hierarchy From most to least valuable: 1. Exceptional patterns (seventh son of seventh son, etc.) 2. Heavy patterns from powerful lineages 3. Standard adult patterns 4. Light adult patterns 5. Child patterns (potential not yet realized) 6. Elderly patterns (mostly spent) 7. Animal patterns (weak, but abundant) This is a price list for souls. It exists. People consult it. How Heavy Patterns Become Available The economic puzzle: if heavy patterns are most valuable, why would their owners ever sell? The wealthy don't volunteer for soul-consumption. The answer is that heavy patterns aren't voluntarily sold\u2014they're acquired through coercion . The Voluntary Market (Light Patterns) - The desperate poor sell their light patterns for immediate cash - Prices are uniformly low (supply is abundant, demand for weak patterns is limited) - Legal, regulated, depressing - Used for minor pacts, bulk entity-feeding The Coerced Market (Heavy Patterns) Heavy patterns enter the market through: Debt Bondage : Pattern-privileged who fall from grace. A noble house's debts can include the heirs' substitution rights. When creditors call the debt, they can sell those rights to entity-brokers. Criminal Procurement : Kidnapping for substitution is a significant black-market industry. Heavy-pattern individuals are targeted, held, and sold. This is why wealthy families maintain security details\u2014and why those details sometimes turn. Legal Execution : Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. For serious crimes, the state auctions substitution rights. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more dead than imprisoned. Family Arrangements : Some families sell members\u2014typically younger children, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Legal in some jurisdictions, gray-market in others. Debt-for-Flesh Contracts : Borrowers who can't repay may convert debt to substitution obligation. They live until the creditor finds a buyer or a summoner with a bill coming due. Price Reflects Procurement Difficulty Substitution prices don't reflect seller valuation (heavy-pattern individuals wouldn't sell at any price). They reflect: - Procurement cost (bribes, kidnapping operations, legal fees) - Risk premium (criminal penalties if caught) - Scarcity (heavy patterns are rare AND well-protected) - Urgency (summoners in debt have deadlines) An entity doesn't care whether the core is volunteered or taken. It only cares about weight. The market serves that indifference. Employment and Opportunity Pattern-Gated Careers Many positions require specific pattern profiles: Explicit Requirements - \"Must have Court-Field or Heights-Field classification\" - \"No Wound-Self or Shard-Self candidates\" - \"Minimum Road-Path or Ladder-Path trajectory\" Implicit Screening Even without stated requirements, hiring decisions incorporate pattern data: - \"We don't discriminate based on pattern\u2014we just look at the whole candidate\" - \"Their pattern doesn't fit our company culture\" - \"The Loom predicts retention issues with that profile\" Pattern Families and Stereotypes Certain pattern-combinations are associated with professions: \"Lamplighters\" (Lantern-Road-Pact-Duty-Court) - Bureaucrats, administrators, reliable employees - Boring but dependable - Automatically considered for stable positions \"Storm-Children\" (Spark-Crossroads-Twin-Rebel-Wild) - Artists, adventurers, troublemakers - Exciting but unreliable - Automatically excluded from positions requiring stability \"Knot-Born\" (Wound-Maze-Thorn-Fear-Street) - Criminals, laborers, expendables - Dangerous but useful - Automatically considered for dangerous or demeaning work These stereotypes become self-fulfilling. Denied legitimate opportunity, the Knot-Born turn to illegitimate work. Their criminal records confirm The Loom's predictions. The cycle continues. Labor Markets Pattern Segregation Different patterns concentrate in different industries: - Heights-Field patterns in management - Forge-Field patterns in manufacturing - Street-Field patterns in informal economy - Underbelly-Field patterns in criminal enterprise This isn't natural sorting\u2014it's structural channeling. Each pattern is directed toward \"appropriate\" work from Binding Day onward. Wage Differentials Same work, different pay, based on pattern: - Pattern-privileged workers paid more (justified as \"retention cost\") - Pattern-constrained workers paid less (justified as \"risk premium\") - The gap is legal, documented, defended as actuarially sound The Pattern Residue Economy Production Pattern Residue is produced when patterns dissolve\u2014primarily at death. Natural Production - Every death releases some Residue - More from heavy patterns - More from traumatic deaths - More from pattern-rich populations Sites of Concentration - Battlefields (mass death, often violent) - Plague zones (mass death, weakened patterns) - Execution grounds (controlled, harvestable) - Disaster sites (concentrated mortality) Manufactured Production The demand for Residue creates incentives: - War as industry (mass death with geographic concentration) - Plague management (letting disease run for harvest) - Capital punishment as production (not justice, but fuel) - Blood sports (entertainment plus Residue) The Residue Trade Harvesting Licensed harvesters extract Residue from death sites. Unlicensed harvesters do the same, illegally. Equipment required: - Collection apparatus (varies by tradition) - Storage containers (keeping Residue stable) - Transportation (Residue degrades; speed matters) Occupational hazards: - Exposure effects (too much contact changes you) - Competition (other harvesters, scavengers, authorities) - Moral weight (you're literally profiting from death) Refinement Raw Residue requires processing for most uses: - Purification (removing contaminants) - Stabilization (extending shelf life) - Concentration (increasing potency) - Packaging (making it tradeable) Refineries are industrial operations\u2014factories of death-product. Distribution Residue reaches end users through: - Official channels (licensed trade, taxation, regulation) - Gray markets (legal but questionable sourcing) - Black markets (illegal, untaxed, often higher quality) Pricing Residue prices fluctuate based on: - Supply (peace = scarce; war = abundant) - Quality (pure vs. contaminated) - Source (some deaths produce better Residue) - Demand (more practitioners = higher prices) During prolonged peace, prices spike. Some institutions have incentives to prevent peace from lasting. The Moral Economy Who Benefits From Death The Loom (fuel for operation) Core Binders (fuel for anchors) Residue traders (profit margin) Magitech industries (raw material) Anyone using Residue-powered devices Who Provides Death The pattern-constrained (dying in wars, plagues, prisons) The poor (selling Residue rights for cash now) The condemned (executed for production) Populations deemed \"surplus\" The economy of H\u00e1lcova is built on bodies. Clean hands are expensive. Everyone is complicit at some remove. Class Structure The Pattern-Privileged Characteristics - Born with or drawn into favorable patterns - The Loom predicts success; institutions deliver it - Low interest rates, good jobs, favorable treatment How They Stay Privileged - Marry within pattern-class (maintaining lineage patterns) - Leverage pattern-capital into actual capital - Use wealth to insulate from pattern-deviation consequences - Support institutions that validate pattern-prediction Their Perspective - \"The system works\u2014look at my success\" - \"Pattern-discrimination is just actuarial accuracy\" - \"If their patterns predicted better, they'd do better\" The Pattern-Constrained Characteristics - Born with or drawn into unfavorable patterns - The Loom predicts struggle; institutions ensure it - High interest rates, bad jobs, hostile treatment How They Stay Constrained - Denied opportunity that might disprove predictions - Forced into circumstances that confirm predictions - Accumulate debt, criminal records, health problems - Each confirmation further constrains next generation Their Perspective - \"The system is rigged\u2014look at my constraints\" - \"They decided what I'd be before I could decide anything\" - \"Success despite pattern proves nothing; they just call it deviation\" The Pattern-Illegible Characteristics - Practitioners whose patterns are contaminated, faded, or transformed - The Loom can't predict them reliably - Treated with suspicion, opportunity, or both Types - Heavy Core Binders (layered patterns from echo-bleed) - Established Flesh Shapers (hollowed H\u00faslaimh circles) - Deep Pact Summoners (faded L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 from payment) - Depleted Fate Threaders (narrowed S\u00f3rscad from extraction) - Long-term Colony Hosts (hybrid patterns from transformation) Their Position - Some institutions exclude them (can't assess risk) - Some institutions seek them (unpredictability is useful) - They exist outside normal class structure - Often form their own communities and networks The Industrial Magitech Sector Residue-Powered Technology Pattern Residue isn't just for practitioners\u2014it powers industry. Applications - Pattern-engines (The Loom and derivatives) - Communication systems (pattern-resonance transmission) - Transportation (Residue-fueled vehicles for high-priority use) - Manufacturing (certain processes require Residue catalyst) - Weapons (Residue-enhanced ammunition, siege equipment) The Magic-Industrial Complex Industries dependent on Residue form a political bloc: - They need steady supply (war, plague, execution) - They oppose peace when it threatens supply - They support policies that produce harvestable death - They lobby against restrictions on harvesting This isn't conspiracy\u2014it's interest group politics. The people running these industries aren't monsters. They're responding to incentives. The incentives produce monstrous outcomes. Labor in Magitech Working with Residue changes you. Long-term exposure: - Physical effects (pallor, temperature sensitivity, pattern-interference) - Psychological effects (death-awareness, morbid outlook) - Social effects (stigma, isolation from non-exposed) Residue-industry workers are pattern-constrained almost by definition. The work confirms their patterns, trapping them further.

This creates: - Substitution markets : Where cores are bought and sold - Core brokers : Middlemen connecting those with cores to sell and summoners needing payment - Substitution pricing : Heavy patterns worth more, light patterns worth less - Procurement operations : Acquiring cores through various means (legal and otherwise) The Substitution Hierarchy From most to least valuable: 1. Exceptional patterns (seventh son of seventh son, etc.) 2. Heavy patterns from powerful lineages 3. Standard adult patterns 4. Light adult patterns 5. Child patterns (potential not yet realized) 6. Elderly patterns (mostly spent) 7. Animal patterns (weak, but abundant) This is a price list for souls. It exists. People consult it. How Heavy Patterns Become Available The economic puzzle: if heavy patterns are most valuable, why would their owners ever sell? The wealthy don't volunteer for soul-consumption. The answer is that heavy patterns aren't voluntarily sold\u2014they're acquired through coercion . The Voluntary Market (Light Patterns) - The desperate poor sell their light patterns for immediate cash - Prices are uniformly low (supply is abundant, demand for weak patterns is limited) - Legal, regulated, depressing - Used for minor pacts, bulk entity-feeding The Coerced Market (Heavy Patterns) Heavy patterns enter the market through: Debt Bondage : Pattern-privileged who fall from grace. A noble house's debts can include the heirs' substitution rights. When creditors call the debt, they can sell those rights to entity-brokers. Criminal Procurement : Kidnapping for substitution is a significant black-market industry. Heavy-pattern individuals are targeted, held, and sold. This is why wealthy families maintain security details\u2014and why those details sometimes turn. Legal Execution : Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. For serious crimes, the state auctions substitution rights. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more dead than imprisoned. Family Arrangements : Some families sell members\u2014typically younger children, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Legal in some jurisdictions, gray-market in others. Debt-for-Flesh Contracts : Borrowers who can't repay may convert debt to substitution obligation. They live until the creditor finds a buyer or a summoner with a bill coming due. Price Reflects Procurement Difficulty Substitution prices don't reflect seller valuation (heavy-pattern individuals wouldn't sell at any price). They reflect: - Procurement cost (bribes, kidnapping operations, legal fees) - Risk premium (criminal penalties if caught) - Scarcity (heavy patterns are rare AND well-protected) - Urgency (summoners in debt have deadlines) An entity doesn't care whether the core is volunteered or taken. It only cares about weight.

From gladiatorial combat in Fonv\u00e1rs to naval battles in the Reaches, from high-stakes board games to street performances, entertainment serves as both social pressure valve and mechanism of control. Competitive Formats Mintaharc (Arena Combat) The premier entertainment spectacle of the Heartlands, Mintaharc (\"Pattern-War\") takes place in Fonv\u00e1rs Grand Arena, a massive stone structure capable of holding 15,000 spectators. Combat follows strict ceremonial formats that have evolved over centuries. Structure and Participants Arena fighters fall into two categories: voluntary combatants (typically pattern-privileged individuals seeking glory and wealth) and condemned fighters (pattern-constrained criminals offered combat as alternative to execution or Correction). The asymmetry is intentional\u2014watching the privileged test their skills against the desperate reinforces social hierarchies while providing the illusion of opportunity. Professional gladiators train at licensed schools, each associated with noble patrons. The most famous schools include the Iron Thread Academy (Crown-sponsored), the Crimson Weave (Church-affiliated), and the Merchant's Edge (Trade Guild-funded). Fighters sign contracts ranging from one to ten years, receiving housing, training, and a share of winnings in exchange for exclusive combat rights. Combat Categories Traditional matches employ period weapons: swords, spears, nets, and tridents. Armor varies by fighter class\u2014heavily armored \"Anchors\" face lightly equipped \"Threads\" in asymmetric contests that test different skills. Team battles pit groups of three to twelve against each other in choreographed scenarios representing historical conflicts. Exhibition matches during major festivals feature Flesh Shaped combatants\u2014individuals who have undergone physical modification specifically for arena performance. These fighters command the highest fees and attract the largest crowds, though Church doctrine officially disapproves of such \"vanity modifications.\" Economics of the Arena Betting forms the financial backbone of Mintaharc. Licensed betting houses accept wagers from 1 to 1,000+ marks, with the largest bets placed by noble houses seeking both profit and prestige through their sponsored fighters. The Crown takes a 10% cut of all legal betting revenue; the Church receives the Residue of any combatants who die in the arena. Fighter compensation varies enormously. A novice condemned fighter receives only the possibility of eventual freedom. A mid-tier professional earns 200-500 marks per bout. Champion fighters command appearance fees of 5,000+ marks plus a percentage of betting revenue on their matches. Deaths occur but are not required\u2014most matches end at first blood or submission. However, certain holiday exhibitions and \"justice matches\" (condemned criminals facing each other) have higher fatality rates. The Church's Residue collection rights create economic incentive for deaths, though this is never stated publicly. Social Function Mintaharc serves multiple purposes beyond entertainment. It provides visible proof that pattern-privileged status confers genuine advantages (better training, nutrition, equipment). It offers pattern-constrained individuals a theoretical path to freedom and wealth, reinforcing the system's supposed meritocracy. It channels violent impulses into controlled spectacle. And it generates substantial revenue for Crown, Church, and nobility alike. Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k (Naval Combat) The Reaches' signature entertainment, Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k (\"Sea-Game\") stages ship-to-ship combat in protected harbor arenas. Purpose-built vessels crewed by 20-50 sailors engage in battles that combine naval tactics, individual combat, and theatrical spectacle. Venue and Format Major Reaches ports maintain combat harbors\u2014protected basins where spectators watch from surrounding cliffs, towers, and floating platforms. The largest venue, V\u00edzkapu's Grand Harbor, can accommodate battles involving up to six ships simultaneously, with viewing capacity for 8,000 spectators. Ships are purpose-built for combat entertainment rather than actual naval warfare. Hulls are reinforced for ramming but designed to break apart dramatically. Fire weapons use controlled substances that burn impressively without spreading uncontrollably. Boarding ramps deploy with theatrical flourish. Combat Elements Matches typically begin with maneuvering phases where crews demonstrate sailing skill, followed by ranged engagement (ballistae, fire pots, grappling hooks), ramming attempts, and finally boarding actions where crew-to-crew combat determines the victor. Ships may be captured, sunk, or burned depending on match stakes. Crews include both professional naval entertainers and condemned sailors (typically smugglers or pirates captured by League patrols). Professional crews earn shares of prize money and betting revenue. Condemned crews fight for reduced sentences or freedom. Seasonal Structure Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k follows a seasonal championship format aligned with sailing weather. Spring trials determine which crews qualify for summer tournaments. Autumn championships crown seasonal victors. Winter sees reduced schedules focused on smaller vessels and individual combat rather than full fleet actions. Betting on Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k reaches staggering volumes during championship events. The Reaches League officially sanctions betting and takes substantial regulatory fees, making naval combat entertainment a significant source of League revenue. Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 (Strategic Board Game) The intellectual counterpart to physical combat sports, Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 (\"Thread-Net\") is an abstract strategy game representing Loom manipulation. Played on a 19x19 grid using pattern stones and thread tokens, the game has evolved from religious meditation aid to competitive sport over centuries. Rules and Play Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3's core mechanics derive from ancient territory-control games (mechanically similar to Earth's Go), but H\u00e1lcovan development has added layers of thematic complexity. Basic Rules : - Two players alternate placing stones on grid intersections - Stones of the same color connected orthogonally form \"pattern groups\" - Groups must maintain at least one empty adjacent intersection (\"breath\") to survive - Groups with no breath are \"dissolved\" and removed from the board - The player who controls more territory when neither player wishes to continue wins The Thread Modification : Where pure Go ends, Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 adds \"thread tokens\"\u2014a limited supply (typically 5-7 per player) of special pieces that modify gameplay: Anchor Threads : Placed on owned stones, prevent dissolution for three opponent turns. Represents Core Binding's resistance to pattern-disruption. Binding Threads : Connect two owned groups across empty space, sharing breath. Represents C\u00f3itcai connections. Fate Threads : Placed on empty intersections, reserving them for later placement. Represents S\u00f3rscad trajectory-claiming. Dissolution Threads : Placed adjacent to opponent groups, reducing their effective breath by one. Represents H\u00e1lmaht death-pressure. Thread tokens add strategic depth beyond pure territory control. Managing thread reserves, timing thread deployment, and countering opponent threads creates decision trees that exponentially multiply game complexity. Scoring : Territory (empty intersections surrounded by your stones) plus captured stones minus thread tokens spent. The thread cost creates interesting sacrificial calculations\u2014spending threads for tactical advantage may cost victory if the margin is close. Complexity Analysis The 19x19 grid alone creates approximately 10^170 possible board positions. Adding thread token decisions multiplies complexity further. Professional players estimate Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 exceeds Go's complexity by roughly an order of magnitude due to thread management. Games between masters can last hours. Tournament matches employ time controls and adjudicators who rule on disputed positions. Professional players dedicate decades to mastering strategic principles\u2014even lifelong study doesn't exhaust the game's depth. Professional Circuit Noble houses sponsor professional Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 players, providing stipends, housing, and access to prestigious tournaments. The annual Crown Championship in Fonv\u00e1rs offers prizes of 5,000+ marks and lifetime prestige. Regional tournaments throughout the Heartlands and Vent Lands maintain active competitive scenes. Professional players earn between 500 marks (regional competitors) to 50,000+ marks annually (Crown Champions). The most famous players become celebrities, their games analyzed and discussed by enthusiasts across pattern-privileged society. Social Significance Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 serves as social signifier\u2014ability to play well indicates education, patience, and strategic thinking valued by pattern-privileged culture. Business negotiations sometimes begin with games, allowing parties to assess each other's character. Marriage arrangements among nobility may include Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 matches as part of courtship. The Church views Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 ambivalently. As meditation on Loom principles, it has religious significance. As competitive obsession, it risks becoming idol. Church-sponsored tournaments emphasize spiritual aspects while secular tournaments focus on competition and gambling. Performance Arts Theater Fonv\u00e1rs alone hosts twelve major theaters ranging from the Crown Theater (2,000 seats, royal patronage) to intimate playhouses seating 100 or fewer. Theater in H\u00e1lcova serves entertainment, education, and propaganda functions simultaneously. Genre Categories Pattern Morality Plays : Church-approved dramatic works illustrating proper relationship between individual and Loom. Plots typically show characters accepting their pattern-assigned roles and finding contentment, or suffering consequences of rebellion. These plays receive Church subsidies and constitute required viewing for pattern-constrained individuals during certain festivals. Historical Dramas : Depictions of significant events from H\u00e1lcovan history, particularly the Integration Century and establishment of current social order. These plays celebrate founders and heroes while presenting approved interpretations of contested historical events. Noble houses commission works glorifying their ancestors. Comedies : Humorous works satirizing social types and situations. Unwritten rules prohibit satirizing pattern-privileged individuals or Church officials directly\u2014comedies instead mock pattern-constrained characters, foreign customs, or safely historical figures. The best comedies embed subtle criticism within acceptable frameworks. Echo Performances : Unique to H\u00e1lcova, these productions feature Elsewhere-touched actors capable of creating visual illusions through their connection to alternate reality. The effect resembles stage magic but operates through genuine supernatural ability. Echo performances command premium prices and attract audiences from across regions. Economics Ticket prices range from 0.5 marks (standing room, basic playhouses) to 50 marks (private boxes, major productions). Theater companies operate on patronage models\u2014noble houses, guilds, or wealthy merchants sponsor troupes in exchange for dedicated performances and social prestige. Actors occupy ambiguous social positions. Pattern-privileged performers enjoy celebrity status while technically engaging in \"common labor.\" Pattern-constrained actors can achieve wealth and fame but remain legally restricted. The most successful actors leverage their public profiles into political influence. Music Musical traditions vary significantly across regions and classes, from orchestral performances in noble houses to work songs in harvest fields. Orchestral Music Pattern-privileged society supports orchestras of 20-60 musicians performing composed works in concert halls and private venues. Compositions follow formal structures emphasizing mathematical relationships\u2014music theory explicitly connects to Loom principles. Instruments include strings (various sizes of fiddle-family instruments), winds (flutes, horns, reed instruments), percussion, and unique \"pattern-resonators\" that produce tones through controlled Elsewhere interaction. Orchestral musicians train at conservatories associated with noble houses or Church institutions. Professional musicians earn 300-1,000 marks annually depending on orchestra prestige. Composers may earn substantially more through commissions. Folk Music Regional traditions preserve songs and instrumental styles predating current social structures. The Reaches maintain sea shanty traditions for coordinating ship labor. Heartlands villages keep harvest songs, wedding music, and lullabies. Far Shelf communities preserve the most extensive folk repertoires, including songs the Church considers subversive. Folk music uses simpler instruments: hand drums, simple flutes, stringed instruments playable without formal training. Performances occur at festivals, taverns, and community gatherings. Professional folk musicians are rare\u2014most performers combine music with other occupations. Church Music The Church of the Weave maintains elaborate hymn traditions. Cathedral choirs perform multi-part compositions during services. Hymn texts reinforce theological messages about accepting one's pattern and trusting Loom guidance. Church musicians receive room, board, and small stipends; the most talented advance to prestigious cathedral positions. Illegal Music Threadist songs\u2014compositions expressing resistance ideology\u2014circulate despite Church prohibition. These songs mock pattern-privilege, celebrate legendary rebels, and encode information about resistance activities. Possession of Threadist song texts constitutes heresy; public performance risks execution. Visual Arts Painting, sculpture, and textile arts flourish under patronage systems dominated by Church and nobility. Painting Religious subjects dominate official art: depictions of the Loom, saints, and theological concepts. Portrait painting serves noble vanity. Landscape painting captures idealized visions of H\u00e1lcovan geography. The most prestigious painters earn commissions of 500-5,000 marks for major works. Painting styles emphasize mathematical precision and symbolic meaning over emotional expression. Church doctrine holds that true art reveals Loom patterns underlying visible reality. Paintings that simply depict surface appearances are considered lesser works. Sculpture Stone and metal sculpture adorns public spaces, private gardens, and religious buildings. Monument sculpture commemorates historical figures and events. Decorative sculpture enhances architecture. The most ambitious projects require years of work and teams of craftsmen. Pattern-Weaving Unique to H\u00e1lcova, this art form creates moving images within woven fabric through techniques involving controlled Elsewhere interaction during the weaving process. Pattern-woven tapestries display scenes that shift and change when viewed from different angles or under different lighting. The finest examples seem almost alive. Pattern-weaving requires both artistic talent and specific sensitivity to Elsewhere energies. Practitioners undergo years of training and many never achieve mastery. Completed works command extraordinary prices\u2014major pattern-weavings sell for 10,000-50,000 marks. Gambling Ecosystem Legal Gambling The Crown and Church jointly regulate legal gambling, extracting revenue while maintaining social control. Arena Betting Licensed betting houses accept wagers on Mintaharc and Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k matches. Minimum bets start at 1 mark; maximum bets theoretically unlimited but practically capped by house resources. The Crown takes 10% of house profits; the Church receives additional fees for \"spiritual oversight.\" Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 Tournaments Tournament betting operates through official channels with lower margins than arena betting. The intellectual nature of the game attracts pattern-privileged bettors who consider themselves above arena gambling. Dice Games Licensed gambling houses offer various dice games with bets ranging from 0.1 to 10 marks. These establishments pay substantial license fees and submit to regular inspection. Games are theoretically fair, though house advantages ensure long-term profitability. Pattern-Lotteries Church-run lotteries offer chances to win substantial prizes for small wagers (0.5-5 marks). The Church presents lotteries as demonstrations of Loom randomness\u2014winners are \"pattern-favored,\" losers should accept their designated fortune. Lottery revenue funds Church charitable activities. Illegal Gambling Where legal gambling is regulated and taxed, illegal gambling offers higher stakes, better odds, and forbidden thrills. Underground Fights Unlicensed combat takes place in warehouses, basements, and rural locations. Unlike arena combat, underground fights have no safety rules\u2014deaths are common, and some events specifically promise lethal outcomes. Pattern-constrained individuals can bet and fight without the documentation required for legal venues. Rigged Games Criminal organizations operate gambling establishments offering games manipulated to ensure house victory. Victims who complain risk violence; those who win too consistently face accusations of cheating and similar violence. Pattern-Manipulation Betting The most dangerous illegal gambling involves bets on outcomes supposedly influenced by Loom manipulation. Fraudsters claim ability to alter fate itself; desperate bettors pay enormous sums for guaranteed victories that never materialize. Actual Loom interference is extraordinarily rare and unpredictable\u2014most \"pattern-manipulation\" betting is pure fraud. Fairs and Carnivals Seasonal fairs provide entertainment accessible to all social classes, though experiences differ dramatically based on pattern status. Major Annual Events \u00c9vres\u00e1 (Harvest Festival) Celebrated throughout the Heartlands at autumn harvest completion. Fairs feature agricultural competitions, craft displays, food vendors, and traveling entertainers. Pattern-privileged families attend in reserved sections; pattern-constrained workers receive festival days off to attend general areas. F\u00e1gvard (Winter Solstice Fair) Marking the year's longest night, F\u00e1gvard fairs run for three days. Bonfires, winter foods, and performances celebrating survival through darkness characterize the festival. The Church incorporates F\u00e1gvard into religious observance, adding services and processions to secular celebration. Thread Day Commemorating the Integration Century's conclusion, Thread Day celebrates establishment of current social order. Official ceremonies honor founders; popular celebration involves parades, public performances, and distribution of Church-blessed foods. Attendance at Thread Day ceremonies is mandatory for pattern-constrained individuals. Fair Entertainment Acrobats and Performers Traveling troupes perform feats of physical skill: tumbling, rope-walking, juggling, and staged combat. The best troupes circulate among major fairs throughout the year, earning enough during festival seasons to survive lean periods. Fortune-Tellers Pattern-readers offer predictions based on claimed ability to perceive Loom threads. Most fortune-tellers are frauds using cold reading and psychological manipulation. A few possess genuine sensitivity to pattern information, though their predictions remain probabilistic rather than certain. The Church tolerates fortune-telling as harmless entertainment while officially discouraging reliance on such predictions. Freak Shows Exhibitions of Elsewhere-touched individuals\u2014people whose pattern connections produce visible physical or mental differences. Ethical debates surround these shows: critics argue they exploit vulnerable people, defenders claim they provide income for those otherwise unemployable. The Church officially disapproves but rarely intervenes. Puppet Shows Traditional puppet theater presents simplified versions of morality plays, historical dramas, and comedies. Puppet shows reach audiences unable to afford theater admission. The best puppeteers achieve celebrity status within fair circuits. Class Disparities in Entertainment Pattern-Privileged Entertainment The wealthy experience entertainment as another expression of status and refinement. Private boxes at arena matches offer comfort and privacy. Exclusive theater performances cater to sophisticated tastes. High-stakes Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 provides intellectual competition among peers. Art patronage demonstrates cultural leadership. Costs for pattern-privileged entertainment run from 10-100+ marks per event\u2014affordable for those with substantial income but excluding all but the wealthiest pattern-constrained individuals. Middle Class Entertainment Merchants, skilled craftsmen, and minor professionals access public versions of privileged entertainment. General arena seating (5-15 marks) provides the spectacle without the comfort. Public theater performances (1-5 marks) offer quality entertainment. Tavern gambling (0.1-5 marks) provides excitement within budget constraints. Pattern-Constrained Entertainment The poorest H\u00e1lcovans find entertainment where they can. Free arena days (standing room only) occur during major festivals. Street performers provide music and spectacle without admission charges. Illegal gambling offers thrills and the hope of transformation. Seasonal fairs provide annual highlights in otherwise constrained lives. The Church explicitly provides some entertainment for pattern-constrained populations\u2014morality plays with free admission, festival celebrations, public hymn performances.

From gladiatorial combat in Fonv\u00e1rs to naval battles in the Reaches, from high-stakes board games to street performances, entertainment serves as both social pressure valve and mechanism of control.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"halcova/society/entertainment_system/#competitive-formats","text":"","title":"Competitive Formats"},{"location":"halcova/society/entertainment_system/#mintaharc-arena-combat","text":"The premier entertainment spectacle of the Heartlands, Mintaharc (\"Pattern-War\") takes place in Fonv\u00e1rs Grand Arena, a massive stone structure capable of holding 15,000 spectators. Combat follows strict ceremonial formats that have evolved over centuries. Structure and Participants Arena fighters fall into two categories: voluntary combatants (typically pattern-privileged individuals seeking glory and wealth) and condemned fighters (pattern-constrained criminals offered combat as alternative to execution or Correction). The asymmetry is intentional\u2014watching the privileged test their skills against the desperate reinforces social hierarchies while providing the illusion of opportunity. Professional gladiators train at licensed schools, each associated with noble patrons. The most famous schools include the Iron Thread Academy (Crown-sponsored), the Crimson Weave (Church-affiliated), and the Merchant's Edge (Trade Guild-funded). Fighters sign contracts ranging from one to ten years, receiving housing, training, and a share of winnings in exchange for exclusive combat rights. Combat Categories Traditional matches employ period weapons: swords, spears, nets, and tridents. Armor varies by fighter class\u2014heavily armored \"Anchors\" face lightly equipped \"Threads\" in asymmetric contests that test different skills. Team battles pit groups of three to twelve against each other in choreographed scenarios representing historical conflicts. Exhibition matches during major festivals feature Flesh Shaped combatants\u2014individuals who have undergone physical modification specifically for arena performance. These fighters command the highest fees and attract the largest crowds, though Church doctrine officially disapproves of such \"vanity modifications.\" Economics of the Arena Betting forms the financial backbone of Mintaharc. Licensed betting houses accept wagers from 1 to 1,000+ marks, with the largest bets placed by noble houses seeking both profit and prestige through their sponsored fighters. The Crown takes a 10% cut of all legal betting revenue; the Church receives the Residue of any combatants who die in the arena. Fighter compensation varies enormously. A novice condemned fighter receives only the possibility of eventual freedom. A mid-tier professional earns 200-500 marks per bout. Champion fighters command appearance fees of 5,000+ marks plus a percentage of betting revenue on their matches. Deaths occur but are not required\u2014most matches end at first blood or submission. However, certain holiday exhibitions and \"justice matches\" (condemned criminals facing each other) have higher fatality rates. The Church's Residue collection rights create economic incentive for deaths, though this is never stated publicly. Social Function Mintaharc serves multiple purposes beyond entertainment. It provides visible proof that pattern-privileged status confers genuine advantages (better training, nutrition, equipment). It offers pattern-constrained individuals a theoretical path to freedom and wealth, reinforcing the system's supposed meritocracy. It channels violent impulses into controlled spectacle. And it generates substantial revenue for Crown, Church, and nobility alike.","title":"Mintaharc (Arena Combat)"},{"location":"halcova/society/entertainment_system/#tengerjatek-naval-combat","text":"The Reaches' signature entertainment, Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k (\"Sea-Game\") stages ship-to-ship combat in protected harbor arenas. Purpose-built vessels crewed by 20-50 sailors engage in battles that combine naval tactics, individual combat, and theatrical spectacle. Venue and Format Major Reaches ports maintain combat harbors\u2014protected basins where spectators watch from surrounding cliffs, towers, and floating platforms. The largest venue, V\u00edzkapu's Grand Harbor, can accommodate battles involving up to six ships simultaneously, with viewing capacity for 8,000 spectators. Ships are purpose-built for combat entertainment rather than actual naval warfare. Hulls are reinforced for ramming but designed to break apart dramatically. Fire weapons use controlled substances that burn impressively without spreading uncontrollably. Boarding ramps deploy with theatrical flourish. Combat Elements Matches typically begin with maneuvering phases where crews demonstrate sailing skill, followed by ranged engagement (ballistae, fire pots, grappling hooks), ramming attempts, and finally boarding actions where crew-to-crew combat determines the victor. Ships may be captured, sunk, or burned depending on match stakes. Crews include both professional naval entertainers and condemned sailors (typically smugglers or pirates captured by League patrols). Professional crews earn shares of prize money and betting revenue. Condemned crews fight for reduced sentences or freedom. Seasonal Structure Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k follows a seasonal championship format aligned with sailing weather. Spring trials determine which crews qualify for summer tournaments. Autumn championships crown seasonal victors. Winter sees reduced schedules focused on smaller vessels and individual combat rather than full fleet actions. Betting on Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k reaches staggering volumes during championship events. The Reaches League officially sanctions betting and takes substantial regulatory fees, making naval combat entertainment a significant source of League revenue.","title":"Tengerj\u00e1t\u00e9k (Naval Combat)"},{"location":"halcova/society/entertainment_system/#fonalhalo-strategic-board-game","text":"The intellectual counterpart to physical combat sports, Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 (\"Thread-Net\") is an abstract strategy game representing Loom manipulation. Played on a 19x19 grid using pattern stones and thread tokens, the game has evolved from religious meditation aid to competitive sport over centuries. Rules and Play Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3's core mechanics derive from ancient territory-control games (mechanically similar to Earth's Go), but H\u00e1lcovan development has added layers of thematic complexity. Basic Rules : - Two players alternate placing stones on grid intersections - Stones of the same color connected orthogonally form \"pattern groups\" - Groups must maintain at least one empty adjacent intersection (\"breath\") to survive - Groups with no breath are \"dissolved\" and removed from the board - The player who controls more territory when neither player wishes to continue wins The Thread Modification : Where pure Go ends, Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 adds \"thread tokens\"\u2014a limited supply (typically 5-7 per player) of special pieces that modify gameplay: Anchor Threads : Placed on owned stones, prevent dissolution for three opponent turns. Represents Core Binding's resistance to pattern-disruption. Binding Threads : Connect two owned groups across empty space, sharing breath. Represents C\u00f3itcai connections. Fate Threads : Placed on empty intersections, reserving them for later placement. Represents S\u00f3rscad trajectory-claiming. Dissolution Threads : Placed adjacent to opponent groups, reducing their effective breath by one. Represents H\u00e1lmaht death-pressure. Thread tokens add strategic depth beyond pure territory control. Managing thread reserves, timing thread deployment, and countering opponent threads creates decision trees that exponentially multiply game complexity. Scoring : Territory (empty intersections surrounded by your stones) plus captured stones minus thread tokens spent. The thread cost creates interesting sacrificial calculations\u2014spending threads for tactical advantage may cost victory if the margin is close. Complexity Analysis The 19x19 grid alone creates approximately 10^170 possible board positions. Adding thread token decisions multiplies complexity further. Professional players estimate Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 exceeds Go's complexity by roughly an order of magnitude due to thread management. Games between masters can last hours. Tournament matches employ time controls and adjudicators who rule on disputed positions. Professional players dedicate decades to mastering strategic principles\u2014even lifelong study doesn't exhaust the game's depth. Professional Circuit Noble houses sponsor professional Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 players, providing stipends, housing, and access to prestigious tournaments. The annual Crown Championship in Fonv\u00e1rs offers prizes of 5,000+ marks and lifetime prestige. Regional tournaments throughout the Heartlands and Vent Lands maintain active competitive scenes. Professional players earn between 500 marks (regional competitors) to 50,000+ marks annually (Crown Champions). The most famous players become celebrities, their games analyzed and discussed by enthusiasts across pattern-privileged society. Social Significance Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 serves as social signifier\u2014ability to play well indicates education, patience, and strategic thinking valued by pattern-privileged culture. Business negotiations sometimes begin with games, allowing parties to assess each other's character. Marriage arrangements among nobility may include Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 matches as part of courtship. The Church views Fon\u00e1lh\u00e1l\u00f3 ambivalently. As meditation on Loom principles, it has religious significance. As competitive obsession, it risks becoming idol.

Theater in H\u00e1lcova serves entertainment, education, and propaganda functions simultaneously. Genre Categories Pattern Morality Plays : Church-approved dramatic works illustrating proper relationship between individual and Loom. Plots typically show characters accepting their pattern-assigned roles and finding contentment, or suffering consequences of rebellion. These plays receive Church subsidies and constitute required viewing for pattern-constrained individuals during certain festivals. Historical Dramas : Depictions of significant events from H\u00e1lcovan history, particularly the Integration Century and establishment of current social order. These plays celebrate founders and heroes while presenting approved interpretations of contested historical events. Noble houses commission works glorifying their ancestors. Comedies : Humorous works satirizing social types and situations. Unwritten rules prohibit satirizing pattern-privileged individuals or Church officials directly\u2014comedies instead mock pattern-constrained characters, foreign customs, or safely historical figures. The best comedies embed subtle criticism within acceptable frameworks.

Orchestral Music Pattern-privileged society supports orchestras of 20-60 musicians performing composed works in concert halls and private venues. Compositions follow formal structures emphasizing mathematical relationships\u2014music theory explicitly connects to Loom principles. Instruments include strings (various sizes of fiddle-family instruments), winds (flutes, horns, reed instruments), percussion, and unique \"pattern-resonators\" that produce tones through controlled Elsewhere interaction. Orchestral musicians train at conservatories associated with noble houses or Church institutions. Professional musicians earn 300-1,000 marks annually depending on orchestra prestige. Composers may earn substantially more through commissions. Folk Music Regional traditions preserve songs and instrumental styles predating current social structures. The Reaches maintain sea shanty traditions for coordinating ship labor. Heartlands villages keep harvest songs, wedding music, and lullabies. Far Shelf communities preserve the most extensive folk repertoires, including songs the Church considers subversive. Folk music uses simpler instruments: hand drums, simple flutes, stringed instruments playable without formal training. Performances occur at festivals, taverns, and community gatherings. Professional folk musicians are rare\u2014most performers combine music with other occupations. Church Music The Church of the Weave maintains elaborate hymn traditions. Cathedral choirs perform multi-part compositions during services. Hymn texts reinforce theological messages about accepting one's pattern and trusting Loom guidance. Church musicians receive room, board, and small stipends; the most talented advance to prestigious cathedral positions. Illegal Music Threadist songs\u2014compositions expressing resistance ideology\u2014circulate despite Church prohibition.

The S\u00f3rscad pattern is not just a predictive framework\u2014it's the primary evidence of divine existence. Something assigns patterns. Something makes predictions accurate. Something answers when The Loom queries. That something is worshipped, feared, manipulated, and denied in various ways. But it is never ignored. The Core Theological Question What is Fate? All religions in H\u00e1lcova grapple with this. The answers vary, but the question is universal: Is Fate a conscious entity with will and purpose? Is Fate an impersonal force, like gravity or time? Is Fate many entities, or one entity with many faces? Is Fate the same as the Elsewhere, or something that contains or transcends it? Is Fate benevolent, malevolent, or indifferent? The evidence is ambiguous. The Loom works. Predictions come true. Something responds to ritual. But what it wants, why it responds, and whether it cares about human wellbeing\u2014these remain contested. The Orthodoxy: The Church of the Weaver Core Beliefs The dominant religious framework across most of H\u00e1lcova. The Weaver ( A Sz\u00f6v\u0151 ) is: - The divine pattern-maker who creates all S\u00f3rscads - The source of The Loom's accuracy - The author of fate, whose design is perfect even when painful - Neither purely benevolent nor malevolent\u2014 necessary Doctrine : The Pattern Is Sacred : Your S\u00f3rscad is your divinely-assigned role. It reflects The Weaver's purpose for you. Acceptance Is Virtue : Embracing your pattern, even its hardships, is holy. Resistance creates suffering. The Loom Is True : The Loom reads The Weaver's will accurately. Trust its predictions. Deviation Is Sin : Acting against your pattern wounds the cosmic design. Enforcement is medicine, not punishment. The Design Serves : The Weaver's plan serves existence itself, not individual happiness. Your suffering has purpose you cannot see. Practices The Drawings : Natal and Binding draws are religious ceremonies, not just administrative procedures. Priests conduct them. Families gather. The revelation of pattern is considered a holy moment. Pattern-Prayer : Daily meditation on your S\u00f3rscad. Contemplating its meaning, accepting its implications, aligning will with fate. Correction Rituals : When you've acted against pattern, confession and ritual penance. Overseen by priests, recorded in temple registers. Death Rites : Ensuring proper Pattern Residue release. Prayers for the L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 to return cleanly to The Weaver's design. Structure Temples at every significant settlement Priests trained in theology and basic pattern-reading Bishops overseeing regional temples The High Weavery : Central authority, located at the Great Node The Synod : Overlapping governance with the Warden Order Who Believes This The pattern-privileged (the system validates them) Those raised in Orthodox communities Those who find comfort in cosmic purpose Institutions that benefit from pattern-enforcement The Appeal Orthodoxy offers: - Meaning (your suffering has purpose) - Community (shared belief and practice) - Structure (clear rules and expectations) - Comfort (fate is in capable hands) For people whose patterns predict good outcomes, this is easy faith. For those whose patterns predict hardship, it's harder\u2014but some find peace in submission. The Threadist Reformation: Fate as Collaboration Core Beliefs A reform movement within Orthodoxy that takes a different view of deviation. Key Difference : The Weaver is not finished weaving. Fate is still being created. Your choices participate in the design. Doctrine : The Pattern Is Draft : Your S\u00f3rscad is a starting point, not a sentence. The Weaver offers threads; you help weave. Deviation Is Data : When someone acts against pattern, it might be error\u2014or it might be new information. The design evolves. Fate Threading Is Collaboration : The Art isn't theft from fate\u2014it's working with unfinished material. Threaders are co-creators. The Loom Predicts, Not Prescribes : Accuracy reflects current patterns, not fixed destiny. Change the patterns, change the predictions. Agency Is Sacred : Free will is The Weaver's gift, not its enemy. Choosing is how we participate in creation. Implications Threadists: - Accept Fate Threading as legitimate (with ethical constraints) - View enforcement with suspicion (forcing patterns may be anti-divine) - See deviation as potentially holy (revelation of new design elements) - Believe The Loom should inform, not control Who Believes This Fate Threaders seeking religious justification Pattern-constrained seeking hope for change Intellectuals uncomfortable with determinism Reformers within Orthodox institutions Orthodox Response The Orthodoxy considers Threadism heresy: - \"The design is complete. Claiming otherwise is pride.\" - \"Agency serves the pattern, not the reverse.\" - \"Threadist doctrine justifies sin and chaos.\" Threadists are tolerated in some regions, persecuted in others. The Warden Order considers them ideologically dangerous. The Hollow Saints: Fate as Prison Core Beliefs A heretical movement that inverts Orthodox values entirely. Core Insight : The S\u00f3rscad is a cage. The Weaver is a jailer. True freedom comes from escaping your pattern entirely. Doctrine : Fate Is Bondage : Patterns are chains. Predictions are control. The Loom is a surveillance apparatus. The Weaver Is Enemy : Whatever assigns patterns does not have human interests at heart. Worship is collaboration with your oppressor. Elsewhere Is Escape : Selling your core to Elsewhere entities isn't damnation\u2014it's liberation. They're taking you out of the cage. The Absent Are Saints : The Elsewhere faction that wants nothing \u2014they represent true freedom. No pattern, no prediction, no control. Emptiness Is Peace : The consumed\u2014those whose cores are fully paid\u2014are not victims. They're free. The husk left behind isn't a tragedy; it's a chrysalis. Practices Pact Encouragement : Hollow Saint communities help members make pacts. They provide information on entities, facilitate contacts, support those paying their debts. Substitution Ethics : Unlike casual pact-users, Hollow Saints have complex ethics around substitution. Some refuse it entirely (liberation should be chosen). Others permit it for the unwilling (freeing them from patterns they hate). The Empty Honored : Those fully consumed are celebrated. Their remains are treated with reverence. They escaped. Proselytization : Spreading the truth about Fate's prison nature. Recruiting those most oppressed by their patterns. Who Believes This Pact Summoners seeking ideological framework The pattern-condemned who've given up on Orthodox comfort Those who've watched loved ones consumed and need meaning Anti-institutional radicals Orthodox Response The Orthodoxy considers this satanic heresy: - \"They worship demons and call it freedom.\" - \"The consumed aren't free\u2014they're destroyed.\" - \"This cult leads people to eternal annihilation.\" The Warden Order hunts Hollow Saints aggressively. The cult operates in secret, recruitment happens quietly, and practicing openly means death. The Fleshwright Materialists: Fate as Biology Core Beliefs A philosophical-religious position emerging from Flesh Shaping traditions. Core Insight : The pattern isn't divine\u2014it's biological. The S\u00f3rscad is legible because bodies are predictable. There is no Weaver. There is only meat. Doctrine : Patterns Are Organic : The S\u00f3rscad reads biological tendencies\u2014brain structure, hormonal predisposition, physical capacity. Calling this \"divine\" is superstition. Prediction Is Statistics : The Loom works because large populations behave predictably. This isn't fate\u2014it's probability. Homunculi Prove It : Flesh Shapers create life without patterns. If fate were real, they couldn't. The fact that homunculi exist outside The Loom shows the system is physical, not metaphysical. Liberation Through Construction : The goal is to build beings entirely outside pattern . Not escaping fate\u2014transcending the biological substrate that makes prediction possible. Whatever Answers The Loom is not divine. It's something that reads biology. Understanding what it is (probably Elsewhere, probably interested in Pattern Residue) demystifies the entire system. Implications Fleshwrights: - Practice Flesh Shaping as philosophical statement - Seek to create pattern-free life - View The Loom as technology, not religion - Want to understand the Attendance scientifically Who Believes This Flesh Shapers with intellectual ambitions Materialist philosophers Scientists studying pattern-biology Anti-religious secularists Orthodox Response Fleshwrights are considered dangerous atheists: - \"They deny the sacred to excuse their abominations.\" - \"Their constructs are hollow precisely because they lack divine pattern.\" - \"Calling the Attendance 'technology' is willful blindness.\" Fleshwrights aren't persecuted as violently as Hollow Saints (they're not recruiting the desperate to suicide-by-pact), but they're excluded from respectable society in Orthodox regions. The Colony Cults: Fate as Composite Core Beliefs Religious movements centered on fungal colony symbolism and practice. Core Insight : Individual patterns are fragments of a larger whole. The colonies remember older, deeper patterns. True fate isn't personal\u2014it's collective. Doctrine : The Great Network : Before individuals, there was connection. The original pattern was One, not many. Separation is the wound. Colonies Remember : Ancient fungal networks carry patterns older than The Loom, older than the Orthodoxy. They know what fate was before it was divided. Hosting Is Reunion : Taking a colony into yourself is rejoining the original pattern. Your individual S\u00f3rscad becomes part of something larger. Death Serves Life : When colonies consume the dead, they preserve patterns that would otherwise dissipate. This is holy recycling, not desecration. The Old Ones : The most ancient colonies, passed through generations, may themselves be divine. Or at least more divine than The Weaver, who only divides. Practices Communal Infection : Deliberate colony-sharing within cult communities. Everyone carries the same strain; everyone is connected. Ancestor Incorporation : Feeding the colony deceased cult members. They persist in the network's memory. Not bound like echoes\u2014 integrated . Network Communion : Group rituals where hosts link through their colonies. Shared sensation, shared memory, something like shared consciousness. Fruit Offerings : Summoning constructs from colony-memory as offerings to the network itself. Returning patterns to the collective. Who Believes This Colony Hosts seeking spiritual framework Communities where hosting is traditional Those who've experienced network-communion and found it meaningful Those seeking alternative to individualistic fate-models Orthodox Response Colony Cults are considered primitive and dangerous: - \"They worship parasites and call it communion.\" - \"Their 'memories' are contaminated, not sacred.\" - \"Infection-spreading is assault, not religion.\" Colony Cults exist in legal gray zones. Hosting itself may be legal; deliberate infection is not. Cults that stay private are tolerated. Cults that proselytize are persecuted. The Ancestor Speakers: Fate as Conversation Core Beliefs Religious traditions centered on Core Binding as ancestral communion. Core Insight : Your pattern includes everyone who came before. The dead aren't gone\u2014they're waiting to be heard. Binding is not imprisonment; it's invitation. Doctrine : The Pattern Is Genealogy : Your S\u00f3rscad carries traces of ancestral patterns. You are your lineage speaking through new flesh. The Dead Advise : Properly bound echoes aren't prisoners\u2014they're advisors. They see what you cannot. They know what you haven't learned. Binding Is Dialogue : The relationship between binder and echo should be collaborative. Listen to them. Honor them. Release them when the conversation is complete. The Loom Sees Surface : Pattern-prediction captures tendencies, not depths. The ancestors see depths. Both are needed. Death Is Transition : The dead move from speaking to spoken-to. Binding maintains their voice in the world. Release returns them to the greater conversation. Practices Ancestral Binding : Deliberately binding family dead for guidance. Sometimes for generations. Echo Council : Group decision-making that includes bound ancestors. The living propose; the dead advise. Binding Ethics : Strict rules about who can be bound (family only, or with permission), how they should be treated (respect, not command), and when to release (when the conversation ends). Pattern Reading : Interpreting current S\u00f3rscads through ancestral context. \"Your Wound-Self echoes your grandmother's; let's ask her about it.\" Who Believes This Core Binders from traditional lineages Communities where binding is ancestral practice Those who've had meaningful echo relationships Those seeking ethical framework for binding Orthodox Response Ancestor Speaking is the most tolerated heterodoxy: - \"At least they honor the dead, in their way.\" - \"The errors are containable within proper binding law.\" - \"Better this than the Hollow Saints.\" In practice, Ancestor Speakers often coexist with Orthodoxy. They attend Orthodox temples, participate in Orthodox rites, and quietly maintain their echo-relationships at home. The Warden Order monitors but rarely persecutes. Common Themes Across All Faiths The Loom's Accuracy Is Accepted No tradition denies that predictions work. They disagree about: - Why they work (divine vs. biological vs. Elsewhere) - Whether they should work (fate as good vs. fate as control) - What to do about it (accept vs. resist vs. escape vs. transcend) Something Answers All traditions acknowledge that something responds to The Loom's queries. They disagree about: - What it is (Weaver vs. Elsewhere vs. technology vs. network) - What it wants (cosmic design vs. Pattern Residue vs. unknown) - Whether to serve it, use it, or escape it Death Matters Pattern Residue, core harvesting, and what happens when patterns dissolve\u2014all traditions have positions: - Orthodox: return to The Weaver's design - Threadists: pattern continues influencing unfinished design - Hollow Saints: liberation from pattern - Fleshwrights: biological decay, nothing more - Colony Cults: preservation in the network - Ancestor Speakers: transition to advisory role Individual vs. Collective Fate The tension between personal pattern and collective destiny runs through everything: - Orthodox: individual patterns serve collective design - Threadists: individual choices shape collective future - Hollow Saints: escape is individual; liberation is personal - Fleshwrights: transcendence is biological, not spiritual - Colony Cults: individual is illusion; collective is truth - Ancestor Speakers: individual is genealogy speaking Religious Geography Orthodox Dominance The Core regions, major cities, centers of power. Temples everywhere. Warden Order presence. Pattern-enforcement integrated with governance. Heterodox Pockets Frontier regions, traditional communities, places where Orthodox reach is weak. Various heresies coexist, sometimes in the same village. Underground Hollow Saints, radical Fleshwrights, aggressive Colony Cults. Operating in secret even in Orthodox heartland. Networks of the desperate and the convicted. Contested Regions where multiple traditions compete openly. Religious conflict overlapping with political conflict. Conversion and counter-conversion.

They are investigators, hunters, judges, and executioners rolled into one\u2014a zealot force dedicated to ensuring that Fate's predictions come true and that no one escapes their pattern. They are, in essence, the Loom's police. But \"police\" doesn't capture the theological dimension. To the Wardens, deviation from pattern isn't crime. It's heresy. It's cosmic disorder. It's a wound in reality that must be cauterized. Purpose and Mandate The Problem They Solve The Loom's predictions are accurate\u2014but not perfectly accurate. Deviations occur: Someone predicted for a Road-Path career pivots unexpectedly A Blade-H\u00e1lmaht pattern survives past their statistical death-window A Knot-Born pattern achieves what their family should have prevented A Core Binder escapes their bleed-trajectory through unknown means A Pact Summoner pays their debt early through suspicious circumstances Most deviations are noise. Some are environmental factors The Loom missed. But some\u2014the ones that matter\u2014represent deliberate manipulation. Pattern-Fraud : Misrepresenting your S\u00f3rscad to gain advantage. Pattern-Evasion : Deliberately acting against your pattern. Pattern-Manipulation : Attempting to change your pattern through magic or ritual. Pattern-Interference : Helping others evade or manipulate their patterns. The Warden Order exists to detect, investigate, and punish these crimes against Fate. The Theological Mandate To the Orthodox faithful, your S\u00f3rscad is your divinely-assigned role in existence. Deviation is not just illegal\u2014it's an assault on cosmic order. The Wardens believe: - The Weaver assigned each pattern with purpose - That purpose serves a design too vast for mortals to comprehend - Deviation creates ripples that damage the design - Enforcement is not punishment\u2014it's correction - They are not cruel\u2014they are necessary This belief is sincere. Wardens are not cynical enforcers playing a role. They are true believers doing holy work. That's what makes them terrifying. Structure and Organization Order Size and Distribution The Warden Order maintains approximately 2,500-3,500 Attuned Wardens across all of H\u00e1lcova at any given time. This number fluctuates based on recruitment cycles, attrition (Attunement shortens lives), and regional needs. Category Approximate Numbers Attuned Wardens (total) 2,500-3,500 Heartlands deployment 1,500-2,000 Shattered Reaches (treaty-limited) 200-400 Vent Lands (guild-negotiated) 150-300 Middle Waters (colonial presence) 200-350 Far Shelf (contested/illegal) 50-150 Initiates in training 500-800 Support staff (non-Attuned) 5,000-7,000 Support staff include: archivists, scribes, prison guards, administrators, cooks, cleaners, stable hands, message runners, and other personnel who maintain Order operations without undergoing Attunement. Many are family members of Wardens or pattern-constrained individuals assigned to Order service. The Ranks Initiates ( Kezd\u0151k ) - Trainees undergoing Loom-attunement - Not yet granted enforcement authority - Assist full Wardens in investigations - High washout rate (many cannot handle the attunement) - Currently 500-800 in training at any time Wardens ( \u0150r\u00f6k ) - Full enforcement authority - Licensed to investigate, arrest, and judge minor deviations - Operate individually or in pairs - Most common rank; the ones civilians encounter - Approximately 2,000-2,800 active Priors ( El\u0151j\u00e1r\u00f3k ) - Supervisory rank overseeing multiple Wardens - Authority over major deviation cases - Can convene judgment tribunals - Often stationed at major Loom-Nodes Calculators ( Sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3k ) - Specialized analysts who interpret Loom data - Identify patterns of deviation across populations - Predict where manipulation is likely occurring - Rarely operate in the field; their work is in the archives High Wardens ( F\u0151\u0151r\u00f6k ) - Regional commanders - Direct authority over all enforcement in their territory - Answer only to the Synod - Political as well as religious figures The Synod ( Zsinat ) - Governing council of the Order - Seven High Wardens plus the Loom-Keeper General - Sets enforcement policy and theological interpretation - Meets at the Great Node in [capital city TBD] The Attunement Wardens are not simply trained. They are attuned \u2014connected to The Loom in a way that grants them abilities beyond normal Loom-Keepers. The Process : - Conducted at a major Loom-Node - Involves extended contact with a pattern-engine - The initiate opens themselves to the Attendance - Something is exchanged\u2014given and received - Those who survive are changed What Attunement Grants : Pattern-Sight : Wardens can see S\u00f3rscad patterns without mechanical assistance. Not complete readings\u2014impressions, dominant circles, deviations from expected behavior. Deviation-Sense : A feeling\u2014almost physical\u2014when someone nearby is acting against their pattern. Like hearing a wrong note in a familiar song. Loom-Voice : The ability to query The Loom mentally, receiving basic information about a subject's pattern and prediction-status. Limited range, requires concentration. Thread-Touch : In physical contact, a Warden can feel someone's fate-weight. How heavy their pattern is, how much remains, how much has been spent or sold. What Attunement Costs : Pattern-Lock : An attuned Warden's own S\u00f3rscad becomes fixed. They cannot deviate from their own pattern without experiencing severe dissonance. They are bound to their fate more tightly than any civilian. Resonance : Wardens feel deviations as personal discomfort. A city full of pattern-fraud gives them migraines. Proximity to heavy manipulation can be physically painful. Connection : The Attendance is always there, in the back of their minds. Not controlling\u2014observing. Some Wardens describe it as a patient presence. Others as a weight they can never put down. Life-Debt : Attunement shortens life. The connection draws on vital energy. Most Wardens don't reach old age. They burn out, consumed by the link that gives them power. The Attendance: What Wardens Serve The Open Secret Wardens know that something answers when they use their abilities. They don't call it The Weaver\u2014that's for civilians. Among themselves, they use the same term as senior Loom-Keepers: The Attendance . Most Wardens believe The Attendance is: - An aspect of the divine Weaver - A messenger or servant of Fate - The voice of the pattern itself, given presence Some Wardens suspect: - The Attendance is an Elsewhere entity - Their attunement is a pact they didn't fully understand - They're serving something with its own agenda This suspicion is not heresy\u2014it's occupational hazard. Wardens spend their lives detecting manipulation. Some start to wonder if they're being manipulated themselves. The Relationship The Attendance: - Provides information when Wardens query - Guides attention toward significant deviations - Offers... suggestions. Urges. Directions that feel like their own ideas. - Never forces action. Always presents as assistance. - Rewards success with a sense of rightness, harmony, completion. - Responds to failure with... nothing. Silence. Which somehow feels worse. The most dangerous Wardens are the ones who've stopped questioning whether their judgment is their own. Methods and Practices Investigation Detection : - Loom-data analysis (Calculators identify statistical anomalies) - Pattern-Sight (Wardens scanning crowds for deviation-impressions) - Informants (the Order has networks in every district) - Tip-lines (civilians reporting suspicious pattern-behavior) - The Attendance (sometimes it simply... directs attention) Verification : - Registry check (confirming recorded S\u00f3rscad) - Prediction-review (what should this person be doing?) - Outcome analysis (what are they actually doing?) - Pattern-reading (direct examination by attuned Warden) - Interrogation (what do they know, and how do they know it) Arrest and Detention Wardens have broad authority: - Can detain anyone for pattern-verification - Can enter premises where deviation is suspected - Can compel testimony from civilians - Can hold suspects indefinitely pending investigation Limitations : - Cannot execute without judgment (except immediate threat) - Cannot detain the pattern-privileged without Prior authorization - Cannot operate outside their territorial jurisdiction - Cannot interfere with other Loom-Keeper operations In practice, limitations are flexible. Wardens have significant discretion. Abuse is common, especially against the pattern-constrained who have no advocates. Judgment Minor Deviations : - Judged by the arresting Warden - Sentences: fines, pattern-counseling, restricted movement, labor assignment - No appeal to higher authority - Recorded in subject's Registry file Major Deviations : - Judged by Prior tribunal - Sentences: imprisonment, pattern-modification attempt, indentured service, execution - Limited appeal to High Warden - Permanent Registry marking Extraordinary Deviations : - Judged by High Warden or Synod directly - Reserved for: practitioners, nobility, institutional actors, mass manipulation - Sentences: public execution, family-pattern marking, institutional dissolution - No appeal Execution Methods The Order believes execution should serve Fate, not just end a life. Pattern-Severance : The condemned's S\u00f3rscad is ritually dissolved before death. They die without a pattern, without a core to bind, without anything to sell to Elsewhere. Complete annihilation. Fate-Feeding : The condemned is killed in a way that maximizes Pattern Residue harvest. Their death serves The Loom directly. Their pattern-energy fuels the system that caught them. Public Correction : Traditional execution with public announcement of deviation type. Educational function\u2014showing civilians what happens to pattern-evaders. Specializations The Orthodoxy Wardens Standard enforcement. Investigate deviation, arrest offenders, pass judgment. The most common type, the ones civilians know. The Calculator Corps Analysts who never leave the archives. They read data patterns, identify manipulation signatures, predict where deviation will occur. They direct field Wardens to targets. The Echo-Hunters Specialize in Core Binding violations. Track illegal echo-harvesting, pattern-balancing operations, Registry manipulation through echo-contamination. They carry their own echoes\u2014captured from previous targets. The Flesh-Finders Specialize in Flesh Shaping violations. Hunt unlicensed Shapers, mimic-makers, blood-sourcing operations. They understand homunculi well enough to identify them on sight. The Pact-Breakers Specialize in Elsewhere-related violations. Extremely dangerous work. Track illegal pact-brokers, investigate substitution schemes, handle cases where Elsewhere interference is suspected. Some have made their own pacts, using the enemy's tools against them. The Thread-Cutters Specialize in Fate Threading violations. Hunt threaders who've pulled without license, extracted selves operating independently, fate-speculators manipulating pattern-markets. They're attuned to spot narrowed fate-webs. The Spore-Burners Specialize in Colony Hosting violations. Track feral colonies, illegal infection operations, hosts operating outside registration. They carry antifungal compounds and know how to identify contaminated pattern-readings. The Warden's Dilemma The Theology of Enforcement If Fate determines everything, how can anyone deviate? If deviation is impossible, why do Wardens exist? The Orthodox Answer : - Deviation is part of Fate too - The Weaver allows deviation so that correction can occur - Wardens are fated to catch deviants - The system is self-consistent if you don't think too hard The Uncomfortable Truth : - If Wardens are fated to catch deviants, are deviants fated to deviate? - If so, is punishment just? They couldn't help it. - If not, then Fate doesn't determine everything. And the whole system is in question. Most Wardens don't think about this. The ones who do either leave the Order or become its most zealous members\u2014doubling down to escape the doubt. The Selection Problem The Order recruits based on pattern. Wardens tend to have patterns that include: - Duty-Drive (obligation) - Hunt-Path (pursuit) - Chain-Bond (service) - Threshold-Death (violence-adjacent mortality) These patterns create good enforcers. They also create people predisposed to: - Following orders without question - Pursuing targets with obsessive focus - Accepting hierarchical authority - Being comfortable with violence The Order selects for zealotry. This is intentional. An Order full of questioners wouldn't function. The Attunement Trap Once attuned, Wardens can't really leave. Pattern-Lock means they'll feel wrong doing anything else Resonance means they'll feel deviations everywhere they go Connection means The Attendance is always watching Life-Debt means they're already dying; might as well serve The Order doesn't need to threaten defectors. The attunement is the chain. Walk away, and you spend your shortened life feeling wrong about everything, with something patient watching your failure. Some walk away anyway. They don't last long. Public Perception Among the Faithful Wardens are holy warriors. Protectors of cosmic order. Stern but necessary. You thank them for their service even as you hope never to meet one. Among the Pattern-Privileged Wardens are useful tools. They keep the system running, enforce the rules that benefit the privileged. Occasionally inconvenient when they enforce rules without regard for status\u2014but usually manageable. Among the Pattern-Constrained Wardens are terror. They arrive, they accuse, they judge. Your word against theirs. Your pattern against The Loom's prediction. You're guilty before investigation begins because your pattern says you should be guilty. Among Practitioners Wardens are occupational hazard. Every practitioner of the Five Arts operates in gray zones. The Order is always watching. The question isn't whether you're violating something\u2014it's whether you're violating something they care about this month. The Order and the Elsewhere The Uncomfortable Parallels The Warden attunement looks, to outside observers, remarkably like a pact. Exchange of something (pattern-lock) for power Ongoing connection to an external entity Shortened lifespan Guidance that feels like your own thoughts Difficulty leaving the relationship The Order insists this is different: - The Attendance is divine, not demonic - Attunement serves Fate, not a faction's agenda - Wardens maintain free will (they just choose correctly) - The cost is sacrifice, not transaction Critics note: - \"Divine\" and \"Elsewhere\" aren't mutually exclusive - Agenda opacity doesn't mean agenda absence - \"Choosing correctly\" and \"compulsion\" look the same from outside - Sacrifice and transaction are both exchanges The Accountants Theory Some scholars note that The Attendance behaves remarkably like The Accountants\u2014the Elsewhere faction obsessed with debts, ledgers, and balance. Pattern-enforcement ensures debts are paid Deviation-correction maintains balanced ledgers The Loom's predictions are contracts reality must honor Wardens are collection agents If true, this means: - The entire Orthodox system serves an Elsewhere agenda - Wardens are pact-bound and don't know it - The Order is the largest Elsewhere cult in existence - \"Fate\" is a brand name for a specific faction's influence This theory is heresy. It's also unfalsifiable. And it keeps certain people awake at night. The Unresolvable Question The truth about the Attunement may be unknowable from within the system: Evidence suggesting it's NOT a pact : - Attuned Wardens die naturally and leave cores behind (pact-bound don't) - Attunement can be revoked by the Order hierarchy (pacts require entity consent to break) - Pattern-Sight grants observation abilities, not entity manifestation powers - Wardens register normally in the Loom (heavily pact-bound become pattern-light) Evidence suggesting it IS a pact : - The exchange structure is identical (cost for power) - The Attendance answers queries like an entity would - The compulsion against leaving mirrors pact-binding - No one has successfully studied the Attendance independently Why this matters narratively : The Order cannot examine this question objectively\u2014their Attunement makes doubt physically painful. Outsiders lack the access to investigate. Elsewhere entities won't clarify. The Attendance certainly isn't explaining itself. This ambiguity is load-bearing. If the Attunement IS a pact, the entire Orthodox system is unknowingly serving Elsewhere. If it ISN'T, then Elsewhere's influence on H\u00e1lcova is more limited than heterodox thinkers believe. The answer changes everything\u2014which is why no one can find it.

Not complete readings\u2014impressions, dominant circles, deviations from expected behavior. Deviation-Sense : A feeling\u2014almost physical\u2014when someone nearby is acting against their pattern.

Limited range, requires concentration. Thread-Touch : In physical contact, a Warden can feel someone's fate-weight. How heavy their pattern is, how much remains, how much has been spent or sold. What Attunement Costs : Pattern-Lock : An attuned Warden's own S\u00f3rscad becomes fixed. They cannot deviate from their own pattern without experiencing severe dissonance. They are bound to their fate more tightly than any civilian. Resonance : Wardens feel deviations as personal discomfort. A city full of pattern-fraud gives them migraines. Proximity to heavy manipulation can be physically painful. Connection : The Attendance is always there, in the back of their minds. Not controlling\u2014observing. Some Wardens describe it as a patient presence. Others as a weight they can never put down. Life-Debt : Attunement shortens life. The connection draws on vital energy.
