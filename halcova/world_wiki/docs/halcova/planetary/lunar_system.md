## Overview

Hálcova's five moons are not natural. The orbital mechanics are too perfect, the resonances too stable. Someone—or something—arranged them. This document covers what's observable and measurable, and addresses the mystery of their origin.

## Orbital Resonances

### The Artificial Pattern

The five moons' orbital periods form near-perfect ratios:

| Ratio | Moons | Period Relationship |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 2:3 | Vég : Hús | 12 : 18 days |
| 5:3 | Hús : Lélek | 18 : 30 days |
| 3:2 | Lélek : Kötel | 30 : 45 days |
| 3:4 | Kötel : Fonál | 45 : 60 days |

These resonances keep the system stable. Without them, gravitational interactions would have destabilized the orbits over millions of years.

**The Implication**: This configuration is not random. Either:
1. The moons were placed deliberately
2. The moons were adjusted into resonance
3. Something maintains the resonance actively

### Natural vs. Engineered

**Arguments for Natural Formation**:
- Resonance locks can form naturally (see Jupiter's moons)
- Given enough time, systems find stable configurations
- No direct evidence of construction

**Arguments for Engineering**:
- Five moons is unusual (most systems have 0-2 large moons)
- The color/composition variety suggests different origins
- Perfect resonance ratios are improbably clean
- Cultural significance (five moons = five circles = five arts) suggests someone designed for meaning
- Vég's spectral inconsistency suggests it's not normal rock/ice

**Prevailing Theory** (among those who study such things):
The moons existed but were adjusted—moved into their current orbits by some ancient civilization or the Elsewhere itself. The purpose: unknown. The timing: before recorded history.

## Alignment Events

### Calculation

Finding when moons align requires calculating the Least Common Multiple of orbital periods:
- LCM(12, 18, 30, 45, 60) = 180 days

**Full five-moon alignment**: Every 180 local days (~twice per year)

### Alignment Types

**The Hand Closes** (All Five Aligned)
- Occurs every 180 days
- All five moons in same region of sky
- Major religious/cultural event
- The Loom's accuracy reportedly spikes
- Some magical operations enhanced
- Some forbidden during this time

**The Three Fingers** (Lélek + Hús + Kötel)
- More frequent
- Associated with binding magic generally
- "Good" time for contracts and pacts

**The Death Pair** (Vég + Fonál)
- Small moons together
- Associated with endings
- Funeral timing often matches this alignment

**Opposition Alignments**
- When moons are on opposite sides of Hálcova
- Creates complex tidal effects
- Associated with conflict, division
- "Moons at war" in common speech

### The Köd Alignment

During the fifth season, moon positions have additional significance:

- Full alignment during Köd: Extremely rare, deeply feared
- Fonál invisible during Köd: "Fate hidden"—normal, expected
- Lélek dark during Köd: Considered dangerous (soul unprotected)

## Tidal Effects

### Basic Mechanics

Five moons create overlapping tidal forces:
- Each moon pulls water toward it
- Multiple moons can reinforce or cancel
- Tidal patterns are complex but predictable

### Tidal Categories

**Spring Tides** (Moons Aligned)
- Maximum tidal range
- Dangerous for coastal areas
- Opens/closes certain sea routes
- Exposes tidal flats, submerges land bridges

**Neap Tides** (Moons Opposed)
- Minimum tidal range
- Calmer waters
- Different navigation challenges
- Some harbors become inaccessible

**Great Tides** (Five-Moon Alignment)
- Extreme tidal range
- Flooding in vulnerable areas
- Sea ice behavior disrupted
- Scheduled events (prepared for in advance)
- Harvesting opportunities (what the tide exposes)

### Regional Tidal Variation

| Region | Tidal Intensity | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Narrow Sea | Moderate | Channeled between continents |
| Shattered Reaches | Extreme | Complex coastlines amplify |
| Middle Waters | Moderate | Open ocean buffering |
| Vent Strait | Low-Moderate | Warm water density difference |
| Far Shelf | Moderate | Long, exposed coastline |
| Polar Seas | Low | Ice dampens tidal movement |

### Tidal Timing and Culture

**Navigation**:
- Tide tables are essential documents
- Skilled navigators memorize patterns
- Errors kill ships and crews

**Architecture**:
- Coastal cities built to tidal range
- Flooding expected, prepared for
- Tide-gates on harbors and districts

**Ritual**:
- Religious ceremonies timed to tides
- "Tide-naming" for children born during specific tides
- Marriage timing considers tidal auspices

## Eclipse Patterns

### Solar Eclipses

**Lélek Solar Eclipse**:
- Only moon large enough for full solar eclipse
- Occurs when Lélek crosses Sárgvas during new moon
- Not every cycle (orbital inclination)
- Duration: Up to 6 minutes of totality
- Frequency: 1-2 per year (partial more common)

**Smaller Moon Transits**:
- Hús, Kötel, Vég, Fonál all transit Sárgvas
- Visible as black dots crossing solar disc
- Scientifically interesting, culturally minor
- Transit timing used for orbital calculations

### Lunar Eclipses

**Hálcova's Shadow**:
- All moons pass through Hálcova's shadow periodically
- Duration varies by moon size and distance
- Moons turn dark red during eclipse (Sárgvas light through atmosphere)

**Eclipse Frequency by Moon**:
| Moon | Full Eclipse/Year | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Lélek | 2-3 | Most dramatic |
| Hús | 4-5 | Fast, brief |
| Kötel | 1-2 | Hard to see (already dim) |
| Vég | 6-8 | Frequent due to inclined orbit |
| Fonál | 1 | Rare, distant |

### Moon-Moon Occultations

Occasionally, one moon passes in front of another from Hálcova's perspective:

**Common Occultations**:
- Lélek occulting others: Most visible (large, bright covering small)
- Vég occulting Fonál: Both small and dim, hard to observe
- Any inner moon occulting any outer moon: Geometrically possible

**Cultural Significance**:
Each combination has interpreted meaning:
- Lélek over Hús: "Soul masters flesh"
- Hús over Lélek: "Flesh obscures soul" (rare, requires specific geometry)
- Vég over any moon: "Death touches [that domain]"
- Kötel occulting: "Contracts hidden"

## The Arrangement Question

### What We Know

1. Five moons in stable resonance is improbable naturally
2. The moons have different compositions (different origins?)
3. Orbital periods create meaningful ratios
4. Cultural/magical significance of five is pervasive
5. No records of arrangement exist (predates history)

### Theories

**The Weaver's Design** (Orthodox)
- The divine pattern-maker arranged the moons as part of fate's infrastructure
- They serve The Loom's function
- Their arrangement proves intelligent design
- Questioning further is impious

**The Ancient Engineers** (Scholarly)
- A pre-human or early human civilization moved the moons
- Perhaps the same civilization that built the polar structures
- The technology is lost, but the result persists
- Understanding how could unlock power

**The Elsewhere Anchor** (Heterodox)
- The moons are anchor points for Elsewhere connection
- They define the boundaries of the bleed
- Their arrangement determines where and when the Elsewhere can manifest
- The five factions may correspond to the five moons

**The Prison Bars** (Hollow Saint)
- The moons are part of the cage of fate
- They enforce the Sórscad system
- Disrupting them might free humanity from pattern
- (Nobody has proposed a method)

**The Natural Improbability** (Fleshwright)
- Improbable doesn't mean impossible
- Given the universe's age, unlikely configurations happen somewhere
- Attributing design is anthropocentric bias
- The cultural significance was imposed after, not built in

### Observable Evidence

**Supporting Artificial Arrangement**:
- Vég's spectral inconsistency (not normal material)
- Perfect resonance ratios
- Correlation between moon positions and magical phenomena
- The Elsewhere bleed's relationship to lunar cycles

**Against**:
- No construction evidence on moon surfaces (from telescopes)
- No historical records despite extensive ancient archives
- If arrangement technology existed, where is it?

### The Working Answer

For practical purposes, most people accept:
- The moons are where they are
- They affect tides, magic, and fate
- Whether designed or natural, they're part of reality
- Understanding the how might matter; understanding the why probably doesn't

## Calendar and Timekeeping

### The Lunar Calendar

Various cultures use different moon-based calendars:

**Lélek Months**:
- 30-day months (Lélek's period)
- 11.67 months per year
- Practical but doesn't divide evenly

**Vég Weeks**:
- 12-day "weeks" (Vég's period)
- 29.22 weeks per year
- Used in some trading cultures

**The Five-Moon Year**:
- Track all five moons' cycles
- Complex but comprehensive
- Used by Loom-Keepers and astrologers
- Average person can't maintain

### Standard Timekeeping

Most cultures have settled on:
- 36-hour day divided into segments (varies by culture)
- Year of 350-351 days (with intercalary adjustments)
- Five seasons as primary year division
- Lunar positions noted for special occasions
