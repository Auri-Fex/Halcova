<div class="halcova-header">[Hálcova: Planetary Parameters](planetary_parameters.md)</div>

## The Star: Sárgvas (The Amber Eye)

**Classification**: K-type orange dwarf
**Color**: Orange-amber
**Temperature**: ~4,800K (cooler than Earth's sun)
**Age**: ~7 billion years (stable, long-lived)

### Visual Effects

**Daylight**:
- Amber-gold tinted light
- Shadows cast with faint blue-purple complementary
- "White" objects appear cream or gold
- Longer, more colorful sunrises and sunsets

**Sky Color**:
- Daytime sky: teal-tinged blue (orange light scattering differently)
- Overcast: bronze or copper cast
- Dawn/dusk: deep amber to blood red, lingering

**Biological Implications**:
- Less ultraviolet radiation (slower vitamin D synthesis, less skin damage)
- More infrared (everything feels warmer than light levels suggest)
- Different photosynthesis chemistry—vegetation likely dark-colored (black, purple, deep red) to absorb available wavelengths more efficiently

## Orbital Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Earth Comparison |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Orbital Period | 526 Earth days (~1.44 Earth years) | 365 days |
| Local Days per Year | 350.667 | 365 |
| Day Length | 36 hours | 24 hours |
| Axial Tilt | ~20° | 23.5° |
| Orbital Eccentricity | ~0.15 | 0.017 |

### Orbital Characteristics

**Eccentricity Effects**:
- Significant difference between perihelion (closest to sun) and aphelion (furthest)
- Perihelion: ~15% more solar energy than aphelion
- This amplifies seasonal variation—perihelion summer is significantly warmer than aphelion summer would be

**Tilt Effects**:
- Moderate seasons from axial tilt (slightly less extreme than Earth)
- Combined with eccentricity creates complex seasonal patterns
- Hemispheric seasons differ in intensity based on whether tilt-summer aligns with perihelion or aphelion

---

## Rotation and Atmospheric Effects

### Slower Rotation Consequences

**Day/Night Cycle**:
- 36-hour days create longer exposure periods
- Greater diurnal temperature swings (more time to heat during day, cool at night)
- Biphasic sleep patterns likely (two sleep periods per day)

**Coriolis Effect**:
- Significantly weaker than Earth
- Weather patterns move more directly north-south
- Fewer large rotating storm systems
- Less efficient heat transfer from equator to poles
- Result: more extreme temperature gradients between latitudes

**Atmospheric Circulation**:
- Hadley cells extend further poleward
- Fewer distinct wind belts
- Weather more predictable day-to-day but more extreme when it changes
- Thermal winds between day and night sides can be significant

## The Five Moons

Hálcova has five moons, creating complex tidal patterns and serving as religious/cultural symbols tied to the five circles of the Sórscad.

| Moon | Name | Size | Orbital Period | Appearance | Association |
|------|------|------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Lélek** (LAY-lek) | Largest (~1/4 Luna) | ~30 local days | Bright, obvious phases, pale gold | Léilcrù (Soul), Core Binding |
| 2 | **Hús** (HOOSH) | Medium | ~18 local days | Reddish tint, fast-moving | Húslaimh (Flesh), Flesh Shaping |
| 3 | **Kötel** (KUH-tel) | Medium | ~45 local days | Dim, difficult to see, grey | Cóitcai (Binding), Pact Summoning |
| 4 | **Vég** (VAYG) | Small | ~12 local days | Fast, bright white point | Hálmaht (Death), Colony Summoning |
| 5 | **Fonál** (FOH-nahl) | Smallest | ~60 local days | Distant, barely visible | Sórscad (Fate), Fate Threading |

### Tidal Effects

**Complex Patterns**:
- Five moons create overlapping tidal cycles
- "Great Tides" occur when multiple moons align (predictable but rare)
- Extreme tidal ranges during alignment affect:
  - Coastal construction and habitation
  - Sea ice formation and breakup
  - Marine creature behavior
  - Navigation and port schedules

**Cultural Significance**:
- Each moon associated with a Sórscad circle and magical practice
- Lunar conjunctions considered ominous or auspicious depending on combination
- Timekeeping uses lunar cycles alongside solar year
- Religious festivals tied to specific moon phases and alignments

---

## Auroral Phenomena

### Why Auroras Are Extreme

**Contributing Factors**:
- Weaker magnetic field (slower rotation = weaker dynamo)
- Five moons (potential magnetic field interactions)
- K-star solar wind (different particle composition)
- Pattern Residue atmospheric concentration

**Characteristics**:
- More frequent (weaker magnetic shielding)
- Visible at lower latitudes (larger auroral oval)
- Different color palette (more reds, purples from K-star spectrum)
- Correlated with moon positions
- **Correlated with Pattern Residue concentration**

### The Aurora-Magic Connection

**Observed Correlations**:
- High aurora activity = high Residue concentration
- The Loom is more accurate during aurora events
- Certain magical operations more effective
- Wardens more sensitive to deviation detection
- Echoes more active and coherent

**Possible Explanations**:
- Residue particles interact with solar wind
- The magnetic field channels both phenomena
- Auroras are visible manifestation of Residue energy state
- Unknown causal relationship

---

## Climate System

### Why Hálcova Is Cold

**Multiple Contributing Factors**:

1. **Distance from Sárgvas**: Orbits at distance producing ice-world baseline
2. **Dimmer star**: K-type provides less energy than G-type at same distance
3. **Atmospheric composition**: Less greenhouse effect than Earth
4. **Pattern Residue**: Ambient Residue absorbs thermal energy (see below)

### Temperature Ranges

| Zone | Láng (Summer) | Csend (Winter) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Middle Waters (warmest) | +15°C to +28°C | +10°C to +18°C |
| Temperate coasts | +5°C to +15°C | -15°C to -5°C |
| Continental interior | 0°C to +10°C | -30°C to -15°C |
| Transition zones | -5°C to +5°C | -40°C to -25°C |
| Polar edges | -15°C to -5°C | -60°C to -40°C |
| Deep polar | -30°C to -20°C | Below -70°C |

### Pattern Residue and Temperature

**The Core Thermodynamic Principle**:

Pattern Residue operates on a **net-negative energy cycle**. The energy absorbed during Residue formation exceeds the energy that can be released through burning. This is the fundamental mechanism behind Hálcova's cold.

**Phase 1: Formation (Death)**
When a pattern-bearing creature dies:
- The pattern dissolves, releasing Residue
- This dissolution process absorbs massive thermal energy from the environment
- The energy absorbed is proportional to the pattern's "weight" (complexity, fate-significance)
- A heavy pattern death can drop local temperature by several degrees
- This heat becomes bound within the Residue's exotic matter structure

**Phase 2: Atmospheric Residue**
Unharvested Residue disperses into the environment:
- Continues absorbing ambient heat (though more slowly than at formation)
- Reaches saturation over time
- Slowly re-radiates some energy, but absorption rate exceeds re-radiation
- Net effect: persistent heat drain from environment

**Phase 3: Harvesting and Burning**
When Residue is collected and burned:
- Releases stored thermal energy (useful heat)
- Residue becomes "spent" or "ash"—thermodynamically inert
- **Critical**: Only ~60-70% of absorbed energy is recoverable through burning
- The remaining 30-40% is permanently lost (converted to exotic matter decay, radiated as undetectable frequencies, or transferred to Elsewhere)

**The Net-Negative Result**:
Every death absorbs X thermal energy. Burning that death's Residue releases only 0.6-0.7X energy. The difference is permanently removed from Hálcova's thermal budget. Over millennia, this has cooled the world.

**The Feedback Loop**:
1. Death releases Pattern Residue (absorbs heat)
2. Residue disperses, continues absorbing heat
3. Environment cools
4. Cold contributes to more death
5. More Residue released
6. Even with burning, net heat loss continues
7. Equilibrium reached when death rate balances Residue decay

**The Civilization Counter-Loop**:
- Harvested Residue provides useful heat (cities can be warm)
- But harvesting doesn't recover all absorbed energy
- Cities become warm islands surrounded by colder hinterlands
- Residue trade flows from death-sites to population centers
- The system requires constant death to maintain warmth

**Implications**:
- Civilization survives by burning death—but it's thermodynamically inefficient
- Peace reduces fuel supply AND allows ambient Residue to accumulate (cooling)
- War produces Residue AND prevents accumulation through harvesting
- The dark bargain: death makes the world cold, but burning death is the only warmth
- Middle Waters' warmth comes from geothermal sources, not Residue—making them uniquely independent
- Polar regions are extreme because ancient mass death was never harvested, and the Residue saturated the environment

## The Five Seasons

### Year Structure

**Year Length**: 350.667 local days (526 Earth days)

**Season Breakdown**:
- Csend (Silence): 76 days
- Olvadás (Thaw): 76 days
- Láng (Flame): 77 days
- Hanyatlás (Decline): 76 days
- Köd (Veil): 45 or 46 days (see Long Köd cycle below)
- **Total**: 350.667 days (average)

**The Long Köd Cycle**:
The fractional day accumulates across years. Every third year, Köd extends to 46 days instead of 45. These "Long Köd" years are culturally significant:
- More time for Elsewhere bleed (dangerous in polar regions)
- Additional day of uncertainty and strangeness
- Traditional time for major decisions, pact-making, and pattern-defying acts
- Calendar-keepers track the cycle; ordinary people simply know "some Köd seasons are longer"
- The sequence: Short (45d), Short (45d), Long (46d), repeat

| **Temperate band** | Minor phenomena—vivid dreams, déjà vu, paranoia |
| **Middle Waters** | Almost nothing—warmth/volcanism/density provides protection |

**Cultural Associations**: The unknown, Elsewhere, madness, visions, transformation

## Köd: The Fifth Season in Detail

### The Polar Bleed

During Köd, the boundary between Hálcova and Elsewhere thins. The effect is strongest at the poles and diminishes toward the equator.

### Full Bleed (Polar Regions)

**Physical Environment**:
- Visual distortions (wrong distances, shifted colors)
- Sound anomalies (echoes from nothing, unnatural silence)
- Temperature fluctuations unconnected to weather
- Ground-level aurora-like phenomena

**Entity Activity**:
- Elsewhere beings manifest without summoning
- Appear partial, flickering, attention wandering
- Most ignore humans; some don't
- All five factions appear:
  - **Accountants**: Counting, ignoring unless debts exist
  - **Hungry**: Seeking sensation—the dangerous ones
  - **Architects**: Adjusting, positioning, arranging
  - **Mirrors**: Watching, following, studying observers
  - **Absent**: Simply present, doing nothing visible

**Human Effects**:
- Pact Summoners feel entities without calling
- Core Binders' echoes become hyperactive, may realize they're dead
- Fate Threaders pull "sideways" futures
- Colony hosts feel colonies reaching toward something
- Unpacted humans: hallucinations, intrusions, compulsions

### Partial Bleed (Transition Zones)

- Entities sensed but not fully manifest
- Voices, glimpses, influences
- Stronger effects near polar edge
- Habitable but disturbing
- Some permanent settlements with adaptation strategies

### Minor Phenomena (Temperate Band)

- Vivid dreams, especially of unlived lives
- Déjà vu and premonition spikes
- Paranoia and suspicion increase
- Minor visual/auditory phenomena
- Loom predictions become strange (accurate about improbable things)

### Protected Zone (Middle Waters)

- Minimal Köd effects
- Theories: warmth, volcanic activity, population density, unknown factor
- Refugees flee toward Middle Waters during Köd
- Prices and tensions spike

### Who Enters the Polar Bleed?

**The Desperate**: Seeking pacts without leverage, escaping patterns, pursuing forbidden knowledge

**The Fortified**: Research expeditions, military operations, resource extraction (heavy protection)

**The Trapped**: Outposts that can't evacuate, indigenous survivors, things that were human

### Religious Responses

**Orthodox**: Polar bleed proves the danger of straying from The Weaver's design. Wardens close transition borders. Returnees examined for contamination.

**Threadist**: The bleed shows fate is unfinished. Insights from Köd may reveal the collaborative nature of design.

**Hollow Saint**: The bleed is the crack in fate's prison. Pilgrimage to the edge (not into full bleed) is holy work.

**Colony Cult**: Colonies remember something from the bleed. The original unity existed there.

**Ancestor Speaker**: Echoes become dangerous during Köd. This is when the dead most need binding—for their protection.

**Fleshwright**: Elsewhere entities are just different biology. Study them (safely) to understand life without pattern.

## Pattern Residue Thermodynamics: Technical Detail

### The Net-Negative Energy Model

Pattern Residue is "condensed probability"—fate-weight made physical. This exotic matter has unusual thermodynamic properties that result in permanent heat loss from the planetary system.

**Energy Budget Per Death**:

| Phase | Energy Flow | Percentage |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Formation (death) | Absorbed from environment | 100% of pattern-weight |
| Atmospheric drift | Continued slow absorption | +10-20% additional |
| Burning (if harvested) | Released as usable heat | 60-70% of formation energy |
| **Net Loss** | Permanently removed | **40-50% of total absorbed** |

**Where Does the Lost Energy Go?**

The ~40-50% of energy that doesn't return through burning is:
- Converted to exotic matter structure (the Residue's physical form)
- Radiated at frequencies Hálcova's matter cannot absorb
- Transferred across the Elsewhere boundary (entities may feed on it)
- Bound into spent Residue as latent instability (ash isn't truly inert—it decays over centuries)

**The Saturation Threshold**:

Atmospheric Residue has a saturation point beyond which it stops absorbing efficiently:
- Fresh Residue: Rapid absorption
- Saturated Residue: Minimal absorption, slow re-radiation
- Over-saturated conditions: Residue begins precipitating (Köd phenomenon)

**The Ancient Cooling Event**:

Climate models suggest that 40,000-50,000 years ago, a massive Residue release overwhelmed the planet's thermal budget:
- Possible mass death event (war, plague, engineered catastrophe)
- Possible Elsewhere incursion (Residue poured through from beyond)
- Possible Loom activation (the system itself generated the initial Residue)
- Result: Rapid cooling as net-negative cycle established
- Current equilibrium: Death rate roughly balances decay/burning, maintaining cold

**Climate Engineering Implications**:

*To warm a region*: Harvest Residue aggressively, burn locally, prevent new deaths
*To cool a region*: Allow Residue accumulation, prevent harvesting, increase death rate
*Current politics*: Heartlands exports Residue (stays warm), imports death (wars elsewhere)

**The Middle Waters Exception**:

The Middle Waters maintain warmth through geothermal energy, not Residue burning:
- Volcanic heat source independent of death-cycle
- Lower historical death rate (smaller population, fewer wars)
- Residue concentration naturally lower (warmth prevents precipitation)
- Result: Uniquely independent from the dark bargain
