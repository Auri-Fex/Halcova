# Institutions and Roles

---
**Story Reference:**
This section is informed by all five stories, with particular focus on "The Reading" (Szòvòtarar corruption), "The Warden" (Wardens and Pattern Integrity), and "Bleed" (Binders and echo regulation). Information brokers like Èitar appear in "The Woven" and "The Reading."

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The stories show how institutions are both stabilizing and corruptible, and how individual roles are shaped by—and shape—the system.
- Characters who navigate or subvert these roles drive the plot and reveal the system’s vulnerabilities.

## Szòvòtarar (Pattern Readers)

Szòvòtarar are the official interpreters of the Attendance during Binding ceremonies. They wield significant power, as their interpretation determines the pattern recorded in the Registry. Corruption among Szòvòtarar is a recurring theme, with some accepting bribes to alter outcomes.

## Wardens (Òràhdar)

Wardens are the enforcers of pattern law, responsible for maintaining order, investigating pattern violations, and overseeing the dissolution of echoes. The Pattern Integrity division manages the suppression or exposure of pattern fraud.

## Pattern House

The Pattern House is the bureaucratic and metaphysical center of the pattern system. It maintains the Registry, trains Szòvòtarar, and houses the archives of Binding records.

## Binders

Binders are licensed professionals who anchor echoes to the living world. They are regulated by both the Pattern House and the Wardens, and are subject to strict quotas and oversight.

## Information Brokers

Figures like Èitar operate in the shadows, trading in secrets, ledgers, and leverage. They are both a threat and a resource to those navigating the system’s hidden currents.
