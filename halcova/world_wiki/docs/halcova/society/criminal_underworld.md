<div class="halcova-header">Criminal Underworld of Hálcova</div>

## Overview

Crime in Hálcova exists in complex relationship with legitimate power structures. Organized criminal enterprises fill gaps left by official systems, exploit pattern-based inequalities, and sometimes serve as the only recourse for those whom legal society has abandoned. Understanding Hálcova's criminal underworld illuminates the world's social fractures, economic pressures, and the limitations of official authority.

The criminal economy represents approximately 5-10% of legitimate economic activity—substantial enough to influence markets and politics, contained enough to avoid threatening system stability. This equilibrium reflects tacit accommodation between criminal organizations and authorities who find complete suppression neither possible nor desirable.

## Major Criminal Organizations

### The Silk Threads (Fonvárs)

The dominant criminal organization in the Heartlands capital operates with sophistication matching legitimate institutions.

**Structure and Leadership**

The Silk Threads employ a hierarchical structure of approximately 500 active members. At the apex sits the Weaver—a position whose occupant's identity remains unknown to most members and all outsiders. The Weaver communicates through intermediaries, maintaining mystique that enhances authority and complicates law enforcement efforts.

Below the Weaver, five Thread-Captains control distinct districts of Fonvárs criminal territory: the Docks, the Lower Markets, the Warehouse Quarter, the Craftsmen's District, and the Entertainment District. Each Thread-Captain maintains significant autonomy within their territory while coordinating major operations through the Weaver's intermediaries.

Thread-Captains command Knots—groups of 10-20 enforcers who handle violence, collection, and territorial defense. Individual Knot leaders earn 1,000-3,000 marks annually; ordinary enforcers earn 500-1,500 marks.

At the base, Loose Ends handle street-level crime: pickpocketing, small-scale theft, message running, and lookout duties. These individuals earn 50-300 marks annually and aspire to Knot membership.

**Primary Activities**

**Protection Rackets**: The Silk Threads' most reliable revenue stream. Businesses in controlled territories pay weekly fees (typically 5-10% of revenue) for "protection" from criminal activity—protection that would otherwise come from the Silk Threads themselves. Annual protection revenue: approximately 150,000 marks.

**Smuggling**: Contraband enters Fonvárs through Silk Thread networks. Untaxed luxury goods, Threadist texts, illegal Elsewhere artifacts, and restricted substances move through warehouses and shops that appear legitimate. Smuggling revenue varies dramatically by year; average approximately 100,000 marks annually.

**Gambling Operations**: Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally and serve customers who cannot access licensed establishments. House advantages and occasional rigging generate steady profits. Annual gambling revenue: approximately 75,000 marks.

**Prostitution**: Unlicensed brothels operate throughout controlled territories. The Silk Threads provide protection to sex workers in exchange for substantial cuts of earnings. Revenue: approximately 50,000 marks annually.

**Pattern-Forgery**: Perhaps the most lucrative per-transaction activity, the Silk Threads produce forged pattern-certificates allowing constrained individuals to access privileges reserved for higher pattern status. A quality forgery costs 500-5,000 marks; detection means execution for both forger and user. Annual forgery revenue: approximately 100,000 marks.

**Residue Theft**: The most dangerous operation involves stealing Residue—the essence left when pattern-bearing individuals die—from Church collection or state storage. Residue has enormous value to certain buyers, but theft constitutes both crime and heresy. Revenue varies; major heists can net 50,000+ marks but occur rarely.

**Relationship with Authority**

The Silk Threads maintain corruption networks ensuring operational continuity. City Guard officers receive monthly payments (50-200 marks depending on rank and territory) for ignoring specific activities and providing warning of raids. Several mid-level Wardens accept payments for similar accommodation regarding pattern-crimes, though senior Wardens appear incorruptible.

The Church's relationship with the Silk Threads is complex. Officially, the Church condemns all criminal activity. Unofficially, certain Church administrators purchase stolen Residue—the commodity's value creates irresistible temptation. This hypocrisy provides the Silk Threads leverage against Church interference.

**Total Annual Revenue**: Approximately 500,000 marks, making the Silk Threads economically comparable to a major noble house.

### The Coral Syndicate (Reaches)

Maritime crime in the Reaches operates through the Coral Syndicate—a decentralized network connecting criminal operations across major ports.

**Structure and Leadership**

Unlike the hierarchical Silk Threads, the Coral Syndicate functions as a confederation. Each major port has a Port Captain who controls local criminal activity autonomously. Port Captains answer to no central authority but coordinate through the Council of Tides—periodic meetings where leaders negotiate disputes, share intelligence, and plan major operations.

The loose structure reflects Reaches culture: independence, practical cooperation, and suspicion of concentrated authority. It also makes the Syndicate difficult to destroy—eliminating one Port Captain merely creates opportunity for successors.

Total Syndicate membership exceeds 1,000 individuals across all ports, though boundaries between members and associates blur significantly.

**Primary Activities**

**Smuggling**: The Syndicate's core business. Reaches geography—extensive coastline, numerous ports, complex maritime traffic—creates ideal smuggling conditions. Contraband includes untaxed goods avoiding Crown duties, prohibited items (Threadist materials, restricted substances, illegal weapons), and human cargo (fugitives fleeing pattern-enforcement, illegal immigrants, occasionally slaves despite official abolition).

Smuggling operations range from small boats moving minor contraband to organized fleets running major cargo. A successful smuggling captain earns 2,000-10,000 marks annually; crew members earn 300-1,000 marks.

**Piracy**: True piracy—attacking legitimate merchant ships—occurs but remains rarer than popular imagination suggests. Most "piracy" involves either organized intimidation (merchant captains paying "passage fees" to avoid trouble) or attacks on other criminal operations. When genuine piracy occurs, Syndicate ships target wealthy cargoes and avoid vessels likely to prompt aggressive response.

**Contraband Trade**: The Syndicate connects producers and consumers of illegal goods throughout Hálcova. Drugs derived from Elsewhere-touched plants, stolen luxury items, weapons prohibited to pattern-constrained individuals—the Syndicate moves these goods with efficiency rivaling legitimate merchants.

**Pattern-Evasion Assistance**: Individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement—those who refuse Correction, escape constrained labor, or commit pattern-crimes—seek Syndicate assistance in reaching safety. Some flee to Far Shelf resistance communities; others seek new identities in distant ports. This service combines humanitarian impulse with substantial profit (1,000-10,000 marks depending on risk and destination).

**Relationship with Authority**

The Reaches League tolerates the Coral Syndicate because complete suppression would require resources the League prefers to spend elsewhere—and because Syndicate activity generates economic benefits. Smuggled goods still circulate through Reaches markets; Syndicate spending supports local economies; and "piracy" that targets competitors more than League merchants creates perverse advantage.

The Heartlands Crown opposes the Syndicate more actively but cannot project sufficient naval power to threaten Syndicate operations in Reaches waters. Border enforcement catches some smuggling; most passes through.

**Total Annual Revenue**: Approximately 2,000,000 marks across all Syndicate operations—making it the wealthiest criminal organization in Hálcova by substantial margin.

### The Hollow Saints (Far Shelf)

Part criminal organization, part resistance movement, the Hollow Saints blur boundaries between crime and political opposition.

**Structure and Leadership**

The Hollow Saints operate in cells of 5-15 members, each largely independent. Cell leaders know contacts in one or two other cells; no one knows the complete organizational structure. This security through compartmentalization protects the organization from infiltration—betrayal of one cell doesn't compromise others.

Total active membership: 200-300 individuals. Support networks of sympathizers, safe houses, and occasional collaborators multiply effective strength significantly.

Leadership operates by reputation and demonstrated commitment rather than formal hierarchy. The most respected members—those who've survived longest, accomplished most, or sacrificed most—command informal authority.

**Primary Activities**

**Threadist Text Distribution**: The Hollow Saints circulate writings the Church considers heretical—philosophical arguments against pattern-determinism, histories presenting alternative accounts of the Integration Century, theological works questioning Church authority. Production occurs in hidden locations; distribution uses dead drops, trusted networks, and embedded codes.

**Pattern-Certificate Forgery**: Unlike commercial forgers who sell to individual buyers, the Hollow Saints produce documents for resistance purposes: false identities for hunted members, papers allowing travel through controlled areas, certificates enabling access to restricted resources.

**Targeted Violence**: The Hollow Saints assassinate Wardens and Church officials responsible for persecution of Threadist communities. Such killings are rare, carefully planned, and intended to impose costs on oppression rather than trigger mass violence. Between five and fifteen such attacks occur annually across the Far Shelf.

**Sabotage**: Destruction targeting infrastructure supporting pattern-enforcement: Loom relay stations, Church record repositories, Warden command posts. Sabotage operations require significant planning and risk substantial casualties; they occur when strategic value justifies danger.

**Harboring Fugitives**: Perhaps their most common activity, the Hollow Saints maintain networks of safe houses and escape routes for individuals fleeing pattern-enforcement. A fugitive reaching Hollow Saint contacts has reasonable probability of eventual safety in remote Far Shelf communities beyond effective central authority.

**Relationship with Authority**

The Hollow Saints are actively hunted. Wardens prioritize their destruction above other criminal targets. Church officials consider them heretics deserving execution. Crown authorities view them as rebels threatening social order.

Despite decades of persecution, the Hollow Saints persist because Far Shelf geography complicates pursuit, local populations often sympathize with resistance, and new members replace those captured or killed. The cycle of persecution and resistance appears stable—authorities cannot eliminate the Hollow Saints; the Hollow Saints cannot threaten regime survival.

**Funding and Economics**

Unlike commercial criminal organizations, the Hollow Saints don't pursue profit. Operating funds come from donations (both from committed supporters and from wealthy individuals hedging bets against regime change), occasional theft for operational needs, and contributions from Far Shelf communities that benefit from resistance activity.

Individual members receive subsistence support rather than wages. Leadership distributes resources according to need and operational requirements. The organization's annual budget totals perhaps 50,000-100,000 marks—modest compared to other organizations but sufficient for their purposes.

### The Consortium's Shadow (Vent Lands)

Within the Flesh Shaping Consortium's legitimate operations lurk activities that, while technically legal, constitute organized harm.

**Structure**

Unlike traditional criminal organizations, the Consortium's Shadow has no separate existence from the legitimate Consortium. Rather, certain Consortium members and facilities engage in activities the organization officially prohibits while enjoying protection from official Consortium structure.

Participation requires both Consortium membership and willingness to cross ethical lines. Perhaps 100-200 individuals participate directly; many more benefit indirectly or maintain willful ignorance.

**Activities**

**Illegal Flesh Shaping Experiments**: Consortium regulations restrict modifications that create unacceptable risk, cause unnecessary suffering, or produce results deemed socially harmful. Some practitioners ignore these restrictions, conducting experiments on subjects unable to refuse (prisoners sold by corrupt authorities, desperate poor individuals, kidnapping victims). Results include medical advances that eventually become legitimate and failed experiments disposed of quietly.

**Body Trafficking**: The Consortium officially permits Flesh Shaping only on willing subjects with appropriate documentation. Underground operations modify individuals without consent—typically creating workers, fighters, or pleasure servants for wealthy buyers. A modified slave can sell for 5,000-50,000 marks depending on modifications.

**Elsewhere Contact Research**: Official Consortium position holds that direct Elsewhere contact is impossible and undesirable. Unofficial research pursues exactly such contact, seeking advantages from direct interaction with the alternate reality underlying pattern and Flesh Shaping. Results of this research remain closely held; rumors suggest both catastrophic failures and disturbing successes.

**Corporate Crimes**: The legitimate Consortium engages in practices that, while legal, constitute harm: monopolistic pricing, suppression of competition, manipulation of regulatory bodies, blackmail of officials who threaten Consortium interests. These activities blur the line between aggressive business practice and organized crime.

**Protection and Impunity**

The Consortium's Shadow benefits from institutional protection unavailable to other criminal organizations. The legitimate Consortium's economic power and political influence shield members from prosecution. Internal discipline handles problems without external investigation. Even Wardens hesitate to pursue cases against Consortium members with powerful allies.

This protection is not absolute—egregious violations can trigger response, and enemies within the Consortium may use Shadow activities against rivals. But the margin for misconduct is substantially wider than that enjoyed by ordinary criminals.

## Criminal Activity Categories

### Smuggling

Contraband movement constitutes the largest criminal activity by economic volume.

**Goods Smuggled**

Threadist texts and other prohibited materials enter Hálcova through Reaches ports, hidden in legitimate cargo or carried by dedicated smuggling vessels. Distribution networks move materials to final consumers.

Illegal Elsewhere artifacts—objects created through or affected by Elsewhere contact—command high prices among collectors and practitioners seeking power outside official channels. Most such "artifacts" are frauds; genuine items are extraordinarily rare and dangerous.

Untaxed luxury goods avoid Crown duties that add 20-40% to legitimate prices. Wine, fine textiles, exotic foods, and quality metalwork all move through smuggling channels.

Restricted substances—drugs derived from Elsewhere-touched plants, compounds with magical properties, addictive materials prohibited for social control—reach consumers through smuggling networks.

**Human Smuggling**

Pattern-fugitives fleeing Correction or constrained labor seek passage to safety. Smugglers charge 1,000-10,000 marks depending on risk and destination. Success rates vary; captured fugitives face execution, captured smugglers face severe punishment.

Illegal immigration—people seeking to enter Hálcova or move between regions without documentation—uses similar channels at lower prices.

The slave trade, officially abolished throughout Hálcova, persists through criminal networks. Victims include war captives from border conflicts, debtors sold by creditors, and kidnapping victims. Slaves move through the same channels as other contraband.

### Pattern-Crimes

Crimes against the pattern system carry extraordinary penalties and generate extraordinary profits.

**Certificate Forgery**

Quality pattern-certificate forgery requires specialized skills: knowledge of official document formats, access to appropriate materials, ability to create convincing verification marks. Professional forgers charge 500-5,000 marks per certificate; amateurs produce documents likely to fail inspection.

Detection rates for quality forgeries remain low—perhaps 10-20% of forged certificates eventually trigger investigation. The penalty for both forger and user is execution, creating strong incentive for quality work and careful use.

**Pattern-Reading Fraud**

Fraudulent fortune-tellers claim ability to perceive pattern information they cannot actually access. This crime against both individual victims and pattern system integrity carries Correction as standard penalty.

More sophisticated fraud involves false interpretation of genuine pattern information—readers who can perceive patterns but deliberately misinterpret them for profit. Detection is nearly impossible without catching the fraudster in explicit deception.

**Loom Manipulation Attempts**

Attempts to manipulate the Loom itself—to alter fate rather than merely predict it—constitute the most serious pattern-crime. Success is extraordinarily rare; most attempts produce no effect, trigger dangerous backlash, or attract Warden attention. Those caught attempting Loom manipulation face execution after extensive interrogation.

The possibility of actual Loom manipulation drives both criminal enterprise and enforcement intensity. If fate itself could be bought, current social order becomes meaningless. This existential threat justifies extreme measures.

### Soul Procurement and Substitution Trafficking

The darkest criminal enterprise on Hálcova: acquiring pattern-weighted individuals for pact substitution.

**The Market Demand**

Pact Summoners owe entities payment in pattern-weight. They can pay with their own cores, or they can substitute others. Entities don't care whose pattern they consume—only that it has sufficient weight.

This creates demand for heavy patterns that far exceeds voluntary supply. The wealthy don't sell themselves. The desperate poor have light patterns. The gap between demand and willing supply is filled by coercion.

**Procurement Methods**

*Kidnapping Operations*: Organized crews identify heavy-pattern individuals (the pattern-privileged, successful merchants, minor nobility) and abduct them. Targets are held in secure locations until sold to entity-brokers. A successful kidnapping operation might net 10,000-50,000 marks for a truly heavy pattern.

Security details exist specifically to prevent this. Some security personnel have been known to turn on their employers when the price is right.

*Debt Conversion*: When pattern-privileged individuals fall into debt, creditors sometimes accept substitution rights as collateral. If the debt isn't repaid, the creditor can sell those rights. This is legal in most jurisdictions—a debt is a debt. Criminal organizations purchase distressed debt specifically to acquire substitution rights.

*Family Sales*: Some families sell members—usually younger children with heavy patterns, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Gray-market in most jurisdictions, openly legal in a few. Brokers specialize in facilitating these transactions, providing discretion and documentation.

*Death Row Speculation*: Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. The state auctions substitution rights for serious crimes. Speculators buy these rights and resell to summoners. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more than light-pattern ones—creating incentives to ensure heavy-pattern individuals commit capital crimes.

**The Broker Networks**

Specialized intermediaries connect supply and demand:

*Matchmakers*: Identify summoners with approaching payment deadlines and match them with available substitutes. Charge 10-20% of transaction value.

*Holders*: Maintain secure facilities where kidnapped individuals are held pending sale. Charge per-day fees plus percentage of eventual sale.

*Transporters*: Move substitutes from procurement to holding to final delivery. Critical for maintaining chain of custody and preventing escape or rescue.

*Legitimizers*: Produce documentation making coerced substitution appear voluntary. Forged consent documents, fabricated debt records, falsified family authorization.

**Pricing**

Substitution prices reflect procurement difficulty, not pattern-weight alone:

| Category | Typical Price | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Light pattern, voluntary | 50-500 marks | Abundant supply, limited demand |
| Medium pattern, voluntary | 500-2,000 marks | Some demand for routine pacts |
| Medium pattern, coerced | 2,000-5,000 marks | Procurement costs included |
| Heavy pattern, coerced | 5,000-20,000 marks | Significant risk premium |
| Exceptional pattern | 20,000-100,000 marks | Rare, dangerous acquisition |

**Law Enforcement**

Substitution trafficking occupies a legal gray zone:

- Voluntary substitution is legal (if documented)
- Kidnapping is illegal, but proving the connection to substitution is difficult
- Debt conversion is legal (contract law)
- Family sales vary by jurisdiction
- Entities don't testify about where their patterns came from

Wardens investigate pattern-trafficking when it intersects their mandate—forced substitution violates pattern-integrity. But enforcement is selective. Heavy resources go to protecting the pattern-privileged; pattern-constrained victims receive less attention.

The Silk Threads operate procurement networks in Fonvárs. The Coral Syndicate moves substitutes between regions. Even the Consortium's Shadow engages in body trafficking that sometimes ends in substitution rather than modified slavery.

**The Moral Horror**

This is a literal soul trade. The purchased individual will have their core consumed by an Elsewhere entity. They will die without residue, without the possibility of echo-binding, without any continuation. They will simply cease.

And yet the market exists because the demand exists because pacts exist because Elsewhere exists. The horror isn't that evil people do evil things—it's that the system creates the incentives and the transactions follow.

### Violence

Criminal violence ranges from individual attacks to organized warfare.

**Contract Killing**

Professional killers available through criminal networks charge rates based on target difficulty. A vulnerable pattern-constrained individual might cost 100-500 marks. A protected merchant costs 1,000-5,000 marks. A minor noble or official costs 5,000-15,000 marks. Killing a major figure—high noble, senior Church official, prominent Warden—requires 20,000+ marks and may simply be refused as too dangerous.

Success rates for professional killers exceed 80% for accessible targets, dropping significantly for protected individuals. Investigation intensity following killings varies with victim status—pattern-constrained deaths often go uninvestigated.

**Protection Violence**

Criminal organizations maintain territory through demonstrated willingness to use violence. Businesses that refuse protection payments suffer arson, assault, or destruction of goods. Rival criminals who encroach on territory face assault, maiming, or death.

This violence is usually instrumental rather than sadistic—enough to establish credibility, not so much as to trigger authority response. The most successful criminal organizations minimize violence while maximizing fear.

**Gang Warfare**

Conflicts between criminal organizations occasionally escalate to open warfare. Territory disputes, personal vendettas, and competition for lucrative operations can trigger sustained violence. Such conflicts attract authority attention and usually end through negotiation once costs exceed benefits.

**Warden Assassination**

Killing Wardens represents the most dangerous violent crime. Wardens protect each other, investigate murders intensively, and impose collective punishment on communities harboring assassins. Successful Warden assassination requires exceptional skill, planning, and luck—or willingness to sacrifice the killer.

The Hollow Saints conduct most Warden assassinations. Commercial assassination of Wardens is theoretically possible but practically rare—the risks and costs exceed what most clients will pay.

### Vice

Criminal provision of pleasure follows predictable patterns.

**Illegal Gambling**

Underground gambling houses offer games unavailable legally (higher stakes, forbidden betting targets, rigged outcomes) and access unavailable legally (pattern-constrained individuals excluded from licensed establishments).

House profits come from standard gambling advantages plus occasional manipulation. Losers who cannot pay face violence or debt bondage.

**Unlicensed Prostitution**

Legal prostitution requires licensing, inspection, and substantial fees. Unlicensed operations avoid these costs while accepting risks: violence from customers without legal protection, disease without mandatory medical checks, exploitation by criminal organizations providing "protection."

Most unlicensed sex workers are pattern-constrained individuals with limited economic alternatives. Some choose the work; others are coerced or trafficked.

**Drug Trade**

Substances derived from Elsewhere-touched plants or created through restricted processes circulate through criminal networks. Effects vary: some merely intoxicate, others enable perception of pattern information, others facilitate Flesh Shaping or other magical effects.

Prices range from 1-5 marks for common intoxicants to 100+ marks for rare substances with magical properties. Addiction creates reliable customers; overdose deaths create investigatory problems.

### Theft

Property crime ranges from opportunistic to organized.

**Residue Theft**

Stealing Residue—the essence of dead pattern-bearers—combines extraordinary value with extraordinary risk. Residue has legitimate uses in Church ritual and Loom maintenance; it also has prohibited uses including Elsewhere contact attempts and Flesh Shaping enhancement.

Thieves target Residue during collection (immediately after death), transportation (moving from death site to Church storage), or storage (Church facilities, state repositories). Each presents different challenges and risks.

Successful Residue theft can yield 10,000-100,000 marks depending on quantity and quality. Detection and capture yields execution after torture for information about buyers and methods.

**Art and Artifact Theft**

Wealthy Hálcovans accumulate valuable objects that can be stolen and sold. Pattern-woven tapestries, religious artifacts, historical items, and fine art all have criminal markets.

Theft from noble houses requires overcoming security—guards, locks, and sometimes magical protections. Theft from Church facilities adds heresy to property crime. Successful thieves either have specific buyers arranged or sell through criminal networks at substantial discounts.

**Cargo Theft**

Goods in transit—whether overland by wagon or maritime by ship—present theft opportunities. Pirates attack ships; bandits attack wagon trains; dock workers pilfer cargo during loading and unloading.

Most cargo theft involves ordinary goods resold at discount. High-value cargo (expensive manufactures, restricted materials) attracts more sophisticated theft with correspondingly higher risks and rewards.

---

## Law Enforcement Response

### City Guard

Urban police forces handle ordinary crime: theft, assault, public disorder, and minor vice. Guard effectiveness varies by city, district, and individual officer.

In practice, City Guards focus on crimes affecting pattern-privileged individuals and major disruptions to public order. Pattern-constrained victims often find Guards uninterested in investigation. Corruption is endemic—Guards supplement inadequate salaries with payments from criminals, victims, and both simultaneously.

Guards investigating organized crime face limited resources, active obstruction, and personal danger. Most focus on manageable problems rather than challenging powerful criminal organizations.

### Wardens

The Warden Order prioritizes pattern-crimes: certificate forgery, Loom manipulation attempts, and crimes by or against Elsewhere-touched individuals. Ordinary crime falls outside their mandate except when it intersects pattern concerns.

Wardens bring superior resources, training, and determination to investigations within their scope. Criminal organizations avoid triggering Warden interest when possible; those who attract Warden attention face serious consequences.

However, Warden capacity is limited. They cannot investigate every pattern-crime, cannot operate everywhere simultaneously, and cannot entirely overcome corrupt officials who protect criminal operations. Wardens are a threat to criminal enterprise, not an absolute barrier.

### Church Authorities

Church investigation focuses on heresy and Residue theft. Crimes without religious dimension rarely attract Church attention; crimes threatening Church interests bring intensive response.

Church investigators have access to resources—including pattern-readers and Elsewhere-touched individuals—unavailable to secular authorities. They also operate under different legal constraints, sometimes extracting confessions through methods secular courts would reject.

Criminal organizations selling Threadist materials or stolen Residue face dual threats: secular criminal prosecution and Church heresy proceedings. The latter often proves more dangerous.

### Private Security

Wealthy individuals and organizations hire private protection ranging from individual bodyguards to armed companies. This creates two-tier crime response: those who can afford protection receive it; those who cannot rely on inadequate public systems.

Private security sometimes cooperates with criminal organizations—purchasing immunity rather than fighting threats. The line between private security and criminal enforcement blurs in some contexts.

---

## Criminal Codes

Major criminal organizations maintain internal rules governing member behavior.

### Silk Thread Code

Members of the Silk Threads follow rules enforced by internal discipline:

No killing civilians without permission from Thread-Captains. Unauthorized violence attracts attention and disrupts operations. Violators face punishment ranging from fines to execution depending on consequences.

Pay tribute to the Weaver. All operations contribute percentage of profits upward through the hierarchy. Failure to pay brings escalating pressure culminating in removal from the organization—often violently.

Protect territory. Members defend assigned areas against rival criminals and maintain order ensuring continued profitable operation. Abandoning territory without permission constitutes serious offense.

No cooperation with authorities. Informants face death—slowly, publicly, and as warning to others. Even members arrested and tortured are expected to reveal nothing.

### Coral Syndicate Code

The Syndicate's decentralized structure produces looser rules:

Honor contracts. Agreements between members are binding. Violation destroys reputation necessary for continued operation. The Council of Tides arbitrates disputes and punishes contract breakers.

Share intelligence. Information affecting multiple Port Captains must be shared. Hoarding valuable intelligence violates the confederation's foundation.

Don't betray Port Captains. Whatever conflicts exist within the Syndicate, external threats to Port Captains affect all. Members who cooperate with authorities against Port Captains face universal condemnation.

### Hollow Saint Code

The resistance movement's code reflects political rather than commercial priorities:

Protect Threadists. The organization exists to defend those persecuted for belief. Members risk themselves before risking protected individuals.

Target only oppressors. Violence against uninvolved civilians violates organizational principles and provides propaganda for enemies. Even in operations against legitimate targets, civilian casualties must be minimized.

No innocent casualties. Operations likely to harm bystanders require exceptional justification. Members accept mission failure rather than innocent deaths when possible.

Accept martyrdom if necessary. Captured members are expected to reveal nothing regardless of torture. Many carry means of suicide to ensure silence.

---

## Integration with Legitimate Society

Criminal organizations don't exist separate from legitimate Hálcova—they're embedded within it, exploiting gaps and contradictions in official systems.

Pattern-constrained individuals denied legal economic opportunity find criminal employment. Goods and services prohibited by law but desired by markets reach consumers through criminal channels. Corruption connects criminal operations to legitimate authorities.

This integration makes criminal activity extraordinarily difficult to eliminate. Suppressing one organization creates opportunity for others. Removing corrupt officials proves temporary as successors face the same pressures. Prohibiting goods and services creates the criminal markets that supply them.

For narrative purposes, criminal organizations provide characters operating outside legal constraints but within comprehensible structures. Crime bosses, smugglers, resistance fighters, and corrupt officials all inhabit spaces defined by both criminal and legitimate rules—spaces where stories of loyalty, betrayal, survival, and moral complexity naturally unfold.
