<div class="halcova-header">Economics and Class in Hálcova</div>

## Overview

Economics in Hálcova cannot be separated from fate. The Sórscad pattern determines access to credit, employment, insurance, and opportunity. Pattern Residue—the energy of dissolving fates—fuels magic and industry. Death is literally productive.

This creates an economy where some people are worth more dead than alive, where peace is expensive, and where the institutions that predict your future have financial stakes in that prediction coming true.

---

## The Fate Market

### Pattern as Asset

Your Sórscad is not just identity—it's capital.

**Pattern-Weight**

Some patterns are "heavier" than others:
- More fate-significance
- More likely to impact events
- More valuable as Pattern Residue when released

Heavy patterns belong to:
- Those born into consequential circumstances
- Those whose choices ripple outward
- Those predicted for significant outcomes (positive or negative)

Light patterns belong to:
- Those born into marginal circumstances
- Those whose choices affect few others
- Those predicted for unremarkable outcomes

**The Market Implications**

- Heavy patterns command higher prices in substitution deals (Pact Summoning)
- Heavy patterns produce more valuable Residue upon death
- Heavy patterns are worth more to The Loom (more data value)
- Heavy patterns are targets for various exploitation

This creates a hierarchy: some lives have more market value than others, calculated and priced.

### Pattern Speculation

**Fate Futures**

Financial instruments that pay out based on whether predictions come true:

- "If subject achieves predicted career trajectory by age 30, contract pays X"
- "If subject dies by predicted cause within predicted window, contract pays Y"
- "If subject deviates significantly from pattern, contract is void"

**Who Trades These**

- Insurance companies (hedging their risk assessments)
- Investment houses (speculating on populations)
- Criminal organizations (betting on specific outcomes they can influence)
- Governments (managing demographic predictions)

**Pattern Arbitrage**

Some patterns are mispriced. The Loom's predictions, while accurate on average, have errors in individual cases.

Arbitrageurs look for:
- Patterns undervalued by The Loom (capable people dismissed as low-potential)
- Patterns overvalued by The Loom (impressive readings masking actual mediocrity)
- Situations where environmental change will shift pattern-outcomes

They invest in undervalued people—education, opportunity, resources—and profit when those people outperform predictions.

This is legal. It's also morally ambiguous: you're betting on people, treating lives as investments, profiting from the gap between predicted and actual humanity.

## Credit and Debt

### Pattern-Based Lending

All credit decisions incorporate Sórscad data:

**Interest Rates**

- Pattern-privileged: Low rates. The Loom predicts they'll repay.
- Pattern-constrained: High rates. The Loom predicts elevated default risk.
- Pattern-illegible (practitioners): Variable. Their patterns are too contaminated for reliable prediction.

**Collateral**

What can you pledge?

- Physical assets (traditional)
- Future earnings (income garnishment)
- Pattern Residue rights (if you die, the lender harvests)
- Pact-substitution rights (you can be offered to an Elsewhere entity)
- Echo-binding rights (you can be bound after death)

The last three are where lending gets dark. Poor borrowers often have nothing to pledge but themselves—their deaths, their souls, their eternal servitude as echoes.

**Debt Spirals**

The pattern-constrained start with high rates, struggle to repay, take on more debt to service existing debt, and eventually pledge increasingly extreme collateral.

Endpoint possibilities:
- Debt-bondage (working off the debt under contract)
- Residue-pledge (worth more dead than alive)
- Pact-transfer (sold to cover what you owe)
- Echo-indenture (bound to serve after death)

The system is designed to produce these endpoints. They're not failures of the system—they're the system working as intended.

### The Pact Economy

**Elsewhere Entities as Lenders**

Pact Summoning functions like supernatural credit:
- You receive power now
- You pay with your core later
- Interest accrues (the more you use, the faster you pay)
- Default is impossible (the entity always collects)

**Substitution as Currency**

Cores are fungible. The entity doesn't care whose core it gets.

This creates:
- **Substitution markets**: Where cores are bought and sold
- **Core brokers**: Middlemen connecting those with cores to sell and summoners needing payment
- **Substitution pricing**: Heavy patterns worth more, light patterns worth less
- **Procurement operations**: Acquiring cores through various means (legal and otherwise)

**The Substitution Hierarchy**

From most to least valuable:
1. Exceptional patterns (seventh son of seventh son, etc.)
2. Heavy patterns from powerful lineages
3. Standard adult patterns
4. Light adult patterns
5. Child patterns (potential not yet realized)
6. Elderly patterns (mostly spent)
7. Animal patterns (weak, but abundant)

This is a price list for souls. It exists. People consult it.

**How Heavy Patterns Become Available**

The economic puzzle: if heavy patterns are most valuable, why would their owners ever sell? The wealthy don't volunteer for soul-consumption.

The answer is that *heavy patterns aren't voluntarily sold—they're acquired through coercion*.

**The Voluntary Market (Light Patterns)**
- The desperate poor sell their light patterns for immediate cash
- Prices are uniformly low (supply is abundant, demand for weak patterns is limited)
- Legal, regulated, depressing
- Used for minor pacts, bulk entity-feeding

**The Coerced Market (Heavy Patterns)**

Heavy patterns enter the market through:

*Debt Bondage*: Pattern-privileged who fall from grace. A noble house's debts can include the heirs' substitution rights. When creditors call the debt, they can sell those rights to entity-brokers.

*Criminal Procurement*: Kidnapping for substitution is a significant black-market industry. Heavy-pattern individuals are targeted, held, and sold. This is why wealthy families maintain security details—and why those details sometimes turn.

*Legal Execution*: Condemned criminals' patterns become state property. For serious crimes, the state auctions substitution rights. Heavy-pattern criminals are worth more dead than imprisoned.

*Family Arrangements*: Some families sell members—typically younger children, spare heirs, or disgraced relatives. Legal in some jurisdictions, gray-market in others.

*Debt-for-Flesh Contracts*: Borrowers who can't repay may convert debt to substitution obligation. They live until the creditor finds a buyer or a summoner with a bill coming due.

**Price Reflects Procurement Difficulty**

Substitution prices don't reflect seller valuation (heavy-pattern individuals wouldn't sell at any price). They reflect:
- Procurement cost (bribes, kidnapping operations, legal fees)
- Risk premium (criminal penalties if caught)
- Scarcity (heavy patterns are rare AND well-protected)
- Urgency (summoners in debt have deadlines)

An entity doesn't care whether the core is volunteered or taken. It only cares about weight. The market serves that indifference.

## Employment and Opportunity

### Pattern-Gated Careers

Many positions require specific pattern profiles:

**Explicit Requirements**
- "Must have Court-Field or Heights-Field classification"
- "No Wound-Self or Shard-Self candidates"
- "Minimum Road-Path or Ladder-Path trajectory"

**Implicit Screening**

Even without stated requirements, hiring decisions incorporate pattern data:
- "We don't discriminate based on pattern—we just look at the whole candidate"
- "Their pattern doesn't fit our company culture"
- "The Loom predicts retention issues with that profile"

### Pattern Families and Stereotypes

Certain pattern-combinations are associated with professions:

**"Lamplighters"** (Lantern-Road-Pact-Duty-Court)
- Bureaucrats, administrators, reliable employees
- Boring but dependable
- Automatically considered for stable positions

**"Storm-Children"** (Spark-Crossroads-Twin-Rebel-Wild)
- Artists, adventurers, troublemakers
- Exciting but unreliable
- Automatically excluded from positions requiring stability

**"Knot-Born"** (Wound-Maze-Thorn-Fear-Street)
- Criminals, laborers, expendables
- Dangerous but useful
- Automatically considered for dangerous or demeaning work

These stereotypes become self-fulfilling. Denied legitimate opportunity, the Knot-Born turn to illegitimate work. Their criminal records confirm The Loom's predictions. The cycle continues.

### Labor Markets

**Pattern Segregation**

Different patterns concentrate in different industries:
- Heights-Field patterns in management
- Forge-Field patterns in manufacturing
- Street-Field patterns in informal economy
- Underbelly-Field patterns in criminal enterprise

This isn't natural sorting—it's structural channeling. Each pattern is directed toward "appropriate" work from Binding Day onward.

**Wage Differentials**

Same work, different pay, based on pattern:
- Pattern-privileged workers paid more (justified as "retention cost")
- Pattern-constrained workers paid less (justified as "risk premium")
- The gap is legal, documented, defended as actuarially sound

## The Pattern Residue Economy

### Production

Pattern Residue is produced when patterns dissolve—primarily at death.

**Natural Production**
- Every death releases some Residue
- More from heavy patterns
- More from traumatic deaths
- More from pattern-rich populations

**Sites of Concentration**
- Battlefields (mass death, often violent)
- Plague zones (mass death, weakened patterns)
- Execution grounds (controlled, harvestable)
- Disaster sites (concentrated mortality)

**Manufactured Production**

The demand for Residue creates incentives:
- War as industry (mass death with geographic concentration)
- Plague management (letting disease run for harvest)
- Capital punishment as production (not justice, but fuel)
- Blood sports (entertainment plus Residue)

### The Residue Trade

**Harvesting**

Licensed harvesters extract Residue from death sites. Unlicensed harvesters do the same, illegally.

Equipment required:
- Collection apparatus (varies by tradition)
- Storage containers (keeping Residue stable)
- Transportation (Residue degrades; speed matters)

Occupational hazards:
- Exposure effects (too much contact changes you)
- Competition (other harvesters, scavengers, authorities)
- Moral weight (you're literally profiting from death)

**Refinement**

Raw Residue requires processing for most uses:
- Purification (removing contaminants)
- Stabilization (extending shelf life)
- Concentration (increasing potency)
- Packaging (making it tradeable)

Refineries are industrial operations—factories of death-product.

**Distribution**

Residue reaches end users through:
- Official channels (licensed trade, taxation, regulation)
- Gray markets (legal but questionable sourcing)
- Black markets (illegal, untaxed, often higher quality)

**Pricing**

Residue prices fluctuate based on:
- Supply (peace = scarce; war = abundant)
- Quality (pure vs. contaminated)
- Source (some deaths produce better Residue)
- Demand (more practitioners = higher prices)

During prolonged peace, prices spike. Some institutions have incentives to prevent peace from lasting.

### The Moral Economy

**Who Benefits From Death**

- The Loom (fuel for operation)
- Core Binders (fuel for anchors)
- Residue traders (profit margin)
- Magitech industries (raw material)
- Anyone using Residue-powered devices

**Who Provides Death**

- The pattern-constrained (dying in wars, plagues, prisons)
- The poor (selling Residue rights for cash now)
- The condemned (executed for production)
- Populations deemed "surplus"

The economy of Hálcova is built on bodies. Clean hands are expensive. Everyone is complicit at some remove.

## Class Structure

### The Pattern-Privileged

**Characteristics**
- Born with or drawn into favorable patterns
- The Loom predicts success; institutions deliver it
- Low interest rates, good jobs, favorable treatment

**How They Stay Privileged**
- Marry within pattern-class (maintaining lineage patterns)
- Leverage pattern-capital into actual capital
- Use wealth to insulate from pattern-deviation consequences
- Support institutions that validate pattern-prediction

**Their Perspective**
- "The system works—look at my success"
- "Pattern-discrimination is just actuarial accuracy"
- "If their patterns predicted better, they'd do better"

### The Pattern-Constrained

**Characteristics**
- Born with or drawn into unfavorable patterns
- The Loom predicts struggle; institutions ensure it
- High interest rates, bad jobs, hostile treatment

**How They Stay Constrained**
- Denied opportunity that might disprove predictions
- Forced into circumstances that confirm predictions
- Accumulate debt, criminal records, health problems
- Each confirmation further constrains next generation

**Their Perspective**
- "The system is rigged—look at my constraints"
- "They decided what I'd be before I could decide anything"
- "Success despite pattern proves nothing; they just call it deviation"

### The Pattern-Illegible

**Characteristics**
- Practitioners whose patterns are contaminated, faded, or transformed
- The Loom can't predict them reliably
- Treated with suspicion, opportunity, or both

**Types**
- Heavy Core Binders (layered patterns from echo-bleed)
- Established Flesh Shapers (hollowed Húslaimh circles)
- Deep Pact Summoners (faded Léilcrù from payment)
- Depleted Fate Threaders (narrowed Sórscad from extraction)
- Long-term Colony Hosts (hybrid patterns from transformation)

**Their Position**
- Some institutions exclude them (can't assess risk)
- Some institutions seek them (unpredictability is useful)
- They exist outside normal class structure
- Often form their own communities and networks

## The Industrial Magitech Sector

### Residue-Powered Technology

Pattern Residue isn't just for practitioners—it powers industry.

**Applications**
- Pattern-engines (The Loom and derivatives)
- Communication systems (pattern-resonance transmission)
- Transportation (Residue-fueled vehicles for high-priority use)
- Manufacturing (certain processes require Residue catalyst)
- Weapons (Residue-enhanced ammunition, siege equipment)

### The Magic-Industrial Complex

Industries dependent on Residue form a political bloc:
- They need steady supply (war, plague, execution)
- They oppose peace when it threatens supply
- They support policies that produce harvestable death
- They lobby against restrictions on harvesting

This isn't conspiracy—it's interest group politics. The people running these industries aren't monsters. They're responding to incentives. The incentives produce monstrous outcomes.

### Labor in Magitech

Working with Residue changes you. Long-term exposure:
- Physical effects (pallor, temperature sensitivity, pattern-interference)
- Psychological effects (death-awareness, morbid outlook)
- Social effects (stigma, isolation from non-exposed)

Residue-industry workers are pattern-constrained almost by definition. The work confirms their patterns, trapping them further.

## The Underground Economy

### What's Traded Illegally

- **Unregistered cores**: Bypassing official harvesting channels
- **Substitution services**: Procuring cores for pact-payment
- **Pattern data**: Stolen Registry information
- **Unlicensed binding**: Echo-services without permits
- **Black-market homunculi**: Especially mimics
- **Infection services**: Colony hosting outside legal channels
- **Fate-fraud**: Forged or manipulated pattern records
- **Deviation assistance**: Helping people evade pattern-expectations

### Criminal Organizations

**Structure**
- Often organized by pattern-family (Knot-Born networks, etc.)
- Use pattern-illegible members for unpredictable operations
- Bribe or coerce Warden Order members
- Operate across regions with different enforcement levels

**Services**
- Debt elimination (including murdering creditors)
- Pattern-laundering (falsifying Registry records)
- Protection (from both Wardens and rival organizations)
- Procurement (cores, blood, colonies, anything tradeable)

**Relationship to Legal Economy**
- Provides services legal economy won't
- Employs people legal economy excludes
- Operates on same logic (profit, transaction, leverage)
- Often partners with "legitimate" institutions quietly

## The Common Person

### Daily Economic Life

For someone without wealth, special patterns, or practitioner abilities:

**Employment**
- Pattern determines options before you apply
- Wages set by pattern-class, not just skill
- Advancement limited by pattern-ceiling
- Termination easy if pattern-excused

**Credit**
- High rates if available at all
- Collateral requirements often exceed assets
- Debt-trap structures common
- Pattern-default possible (selling yourself)

**Housing**
- Pattern-segregated neighborhoods
- Insurance based on district pattern-profile
- Mobility limited by pattern-appropriate areas
- Quality tracks pattern-privilege

**Healthcare**
- Treatment recommendations incorporate pattern-data
- "Pattern-appropriate care" means lower quality for constrained
- End-of-life decisions consider Residue value
- Chronic conditions managed by pattern-expectation

**Family**
- Marriage recommendations based on pattern-compatibility
- Child-bearing decisions influenced by predicted patterns
- Education options constrained by pattern-category
- Inheritance affected by pattern-privilege

### Coping Strategies

**Acceptance**
- "My pattern is my pattern"
- Find meaning in what fate allows
- Orthodox faith provides framework
- Community within pattern-class

**Hustle**
- Work the system's margins
- Find opportunities The Loom undervalues
- Build informal networks
- Accumulate resources despite predictions

**Escape**
- Pattern-illegibility through practice (if you can afford initiation)
- Geographical mobility (frontier regions, different enforcement)
- Criminal economy (if legitimate economy excludes you)
- Pact Summoning (trade pattern for power, lose both eventually)

**Resistance**
- Threadist reform movements
- Hollow Saint nihilism
- Pattern-fraud and deviation
- Collective action against pattern-discrimination

Most people combine these, shifting between acceptance, hustle, escape attempts, and occasional resistance depending on circumstances.
