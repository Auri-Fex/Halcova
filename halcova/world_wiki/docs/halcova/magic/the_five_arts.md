## Overview


In [Hálcova](../../index.md), power is never free. Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects.


The five magical traditions—collectively called the [Five Arts](the_five_arts.md)—each represent a different answer to the question: *What are you willing to pay?*

| Art                        | What You Spend      | What You Get           | What It Costs You                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **[Core Binding](the_five_arts.md#core-binding)**     | The dead            | Echoes of the deceased | Your sense of self (bleed corruption) |
| **[Flesh Shaping](the_five_arts.md#flesh-shaping)**    | Blood and meat      | Constructed servants   | Your body and humanity                |
| **[Pact Summoning](the_five_arts.md#pact-summoning)**   | Your soul           | [Elsewhere](../metaphysics/additional_systems.md) entities     | Your autonomy and existence           |
| **[Fate Threading](the_five_arts.md#fate-threading)**   | Your future         | Versions of yourself   | Your potential and becoming           |
| **[Colony Summoning](the_five_arts.md#colony-summoning)** | Corpses and biomass | Fungal constructs      | Your identity and bodily sovereignty  |


Each [Art](the_five_arts.md) is a transaction. Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late.

## [Core Binding](the_five_arts.md#core-binding)

<div style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">The Art of Holding the Dead</div>

### Fundamental Principle

When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit—something more fundamental. The **core** is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned.

Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical [anchors](the_five_arts.md#anchors) and calling them forth as **[echoes](the_five_arts.md#echoes)**—manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life.


The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist.

You know. They don't. That's the relationship.

### The Core

**What It Is**

The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans—animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo.

**Harvesting**

Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor.

Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete).

The strongest cores come from:

- Violent deaths
- Deaths with unfinished purpose
- Deaths accompanied by intense emotion
- Deaths that the dying refused to accept

The weakest cores come from:

- Peaceful passings
- Deaths accepted and prepared for
- Lives that felt complete
- Deaths in old age after long decline


### [Anchors](the_five_arts.md#anchors)

**Physical Form**

A core needs a home. The anchor is a physical object that houses the bound echo—a prison dressed as a portrait.


Anchors can take many forms:

- Carved figurines or statuettes
- Painted tiles or tablets
- Etched metal plates
- Clay tablets with pressed images
- Bone carvings
- Jewelry settings
- Decorated containers

The anchor must **depict** the bound echo. This can happen two ways:

1. **Natural manifestation**: The anchor *changes* when a core is bound to it, the image of the echo appearing on or in the material as if etched by invisible hands.
2. **Artistic creation**: The binder creates the depiction deliberately, crafting an image of the creature to be bound before or during the binding process.

Looking at a binder's collection tells you who they carry. The echoes watch out from their prisons, rendered in whatever medium houses them.

**Carrying Capacity**

A binder can carry as many anchors as they can physically transport. The limitation isn't storage—it's activation.

### Summoning and Limits

**Activation**

To summon an echo, a binder activates its anchor. The echo manifests physically, drawn from the anchor into material reality. It can interact with the world, fight, speak, perform tasks—everything the living creature could do.

**The Bottleneck**

Multiple simultaneous activations create problems:

1. **Resonance interference**: Too many active echoes at once causes bleeding between them. Their memories mix. Their identities blur. Two echoes might start sharing the same thought, speaking in unison, losing track of which one is which.
2. **Physical drain**: Every active echo taxes the binder. The more echoes active, the greater the exhaustion. Running too many is like holding your breath—eventually something gives.

The limit is personal. Some binders can run four echoes comfortably. Others struggle with two. Veterans know their limit exactly. Amateurs find out the hard way, usually when their echoes start merging into something that used to be two people and is now neither.

### Upkeep: The Resource

**[RESOURCE NAME: TBD — Placeholder for Conlang]**

Echoes don't maintain themselves. They need fuel—a consumable resource that keeps them coherent and stable.

**What It Does**

The resource feeds the anchor, which feeds the echo. Without regular doses:

- The echo becomes confused
- Memories fragment and scramble
- Identity degrades
- Eventually, what you summon isn't what you bound—it's a broken thing that used to be a person

**Resource Economy**

The resource creates an entire economy:

- **Harvesters** who collect it from sources
- **Refiners** who process it into usable form
- **Merchants** who trade it
- **Smugglers** who move it illegally
- **Black markets** for rare or potent variants

**Consumption Rates**

- Simple echoes (animals, simple minds): low consumption
- Complex echoes (humans, intelligent creatures): moderate consumption
- Powerful or traumatic echoes: high consumption
- Echoes that have become **aware**: highest consumption

An echo that realizes it's dead burns through resources faster. The awareness creates strain—the echo fighting against its condition, the anchor struggling to contain something that wants out. Aware echoes require constant upkeep and intensive focus.

**Quality Matters**

The resource can be:

- Adulterated (stretched with fillers—causes instability)
- Counterfeited (fake—causes degradation)
- Aged (loses potency over time)
- Fresh (most effective, most expensive)

Experienced binders can assess quality by look, smell, even taste. They know when they're being cheated. They know when the resource is good enough to maintain a difficult echo, or only good enough for simple ones.

**Scarcity as Plot**

Peace is expensive for binders. Whatever the resource turns out to be, it's easier to acquire during times of mass death—wars, plagues, disasters. Stability means scarcity. Scarcity means hard choices about which echoes get maintained and which get neglected.

### Decay: Echo Bleed

**The One-Way Corruption**

Holding echoes costs you. Not in resource or effort—in *self*. The echoes bleed into you. Their memories, sensations, preferences, fears—they leak from anchor to holder over time.

**Manifestations**

1. **Phantom sensations**: You feel echoes of how they died. Carry someone who burned, and your skin prickles with heat. Carry someone who drowned, and you're short of breath in open air.
2. **Behavioral drift**: You pick up habits that aren't yours. Preferences shift. You hate a food you used to love. You flinch at dogs, and you've never had a bad experience with dogs—but one of your echoes did.
3. **Memory intrusion**: Flashes of their life. A spouse's face you've never seen. A childhood home that isn't yours. The more you carry, the more other lives crowd into your head.

**Awareness Accelerates Decay**

An echo that knows it's dead creates more bleed. The awareness is like a wound that won't close—the echo's distress seeping constantly into the binder.

**The Long-Term Cost**

Old binders are strange. Their mannerisms are patchwork—bits and pieces of everyone they've ever carried. Some lose track of which memories are theirs. Some find their original personality buried under layers of accumulated dead.

The joke among binders: "Carry enough echoes, and you don't know who you are. Carry them long enough, and it doesn't matter—you're all of them now."

### Release

**It's Possible**

A binder can release an echo. Break the bond, let the core dissipate, allow what remains to finally end.

**It's Rare**

Reasons not to release:

- **Money**: Echoes are assets. Valuable ones are worth fortunes.
- **Spite**: "You don't get to rest until I say so."
- **Revenge**: "You'll serve me until I'm done with you."
- **Nostalgia**: "I can't let go. They're all I have left of her."
- **Love**: "If I release him, he's really gone. As long as I hold him, he's still here."
- **Exhaustion**: "Releasing feels like losing them again. I already lost them once."

Most binders hold on long past the point of reason. The relationship between binder and echo is complicated—captor and prisoner, owner and owned, but also something that can feel like partnership, even family.

Releasing is admitting it's over. Most people aren't good at that.

### Opposition

**The echoes don't know they're dead. So who objects?**

The living.

1. **Family members**: Someone recognizes a bound echo. Their mother. Their brother. Their child. The echo doesn't understand why this stranger is crying and begging the binder to "let them go." The family member understands too well.
2. **Religious/philosophical groups**: Traditions that believe the dead deserve passage, that binding is desecration, that what binders do is cosmic crime. Some are peaceful advocates. Some are violent abolitionists.
3. **Former binders**: People who released their echoes and now crusade against the practice. Converts are the most zealous preachers. "I know what it's like to hold someone against their will. I know what I told myself to justify it. I'm not letting anyone else live that lie."
4. **Governments**: Not opposed to binding—opposed to *uncontrolled* binding. They want to regulate who gets to keep their dead. Registration. Taxation. Restrictions on certain echoes (public figures, criminals, military personnel). The opposition isn't moral; it's bureaucratic.

### Economy

**The Trade in Death**

Cores are commodities. Rare and powerful ones command high prices. An entire economy exists around death:

- **Poachers**: Hunting rare creatures specifically for their cores
- **Assassins**: Paid to kill specific targets so their cores can be harvested
- **Battlefield scavengers**: Following armies, collecting from the dead before anyone else can
- **Professional harvesters**: Legitimate (sometimes) businesspeople who specialize in core extraction
- **Brokers**: Connecting buyers with sellers, taking a cut
- **Appraisers**: Determining the value of a core before sale
- **Storage facilities**: Keeping anchors safe for clients who can't maintain their own collections

Wars aren't just political events. They're market opportunities. Every battle produces inventory.

### Anomalies

**What Happens If You Extract a Core from Something Still Alive?**

It shouldn't be possible. The core is what remains after death. It forms *because* of death.

But some have tried. Some have succeeded, after a fashion.

The results are **anomalies**:

- The original creature, still alive, but *wrong*. Missing something fundamental. Walking and talking but hollow in a way that unnerves everyone who meets them.
- The extracted core, bound to an anchor, but *wrong*. An echo of someone who isn't dead, containing memories the original is still making.
- Or both. A living person and their echo, existing simultaneously, neither quite complete.

Anomalies are rare, disturbing, and valuable to certain collectors. They're also deeply unstable—the situation resolves eventually, usually badly for everyone involved.

## [Flesh Shaping](the_five_arts.md#flesh-shaping)

<div style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">The Art of Building Servants</div>

### Fundamental Principle


Flesh Shaping creates **homunculi**—constructed servants built from raw materials and animated with blood. Unlike [echoes](the_five_arts.md#echoes), homunculi never lived. They have no history, no memories, no existence prior to their creation. They are *made*, not captured.

This sounds cleaner than Core Binding. It isn't. The horror is different, not lesser.

### Creation

**Raw Materials**

A homunculus is built from physical components:

- **Flesh** (from corpses, butcher shops, battlefields)
- **Bone** (structural support, framework)
- **Clay** (crude but durable)
- **Metal** (for specialized purposes)
- **Wax** (malleable, temporary)
- **Leather** (flexible, resilient)

Different materials produce different results. The medium shapes the creation:

- **Bone-wrights** build skeletal servants—light, fast, clicking when they move
- **Flesh-sculptors** work in meat and muscle—things that bleed when cut, that smell like bodies
- **Clay-formers** make crude laborers—durable, slow, expressionless
- **Metal-smiths** forge mechanical servants—precise, cold, expensive

A crafter typically specializes. Working in multiple materials requires different skills, different tools, different mindsets.

**The Spark: Blood**

Materials alone produce nothing but a statue. The homunculus needs *life*, and that life comes from blood.

**Creation Cost**

The crafter bleeds into their creation. Not a nick, not a small cut—a *letting*. The amount scales with complexity:

- **Simple tool** (a fetching hand, a watching eye): A cupful. Dizziness, hunger afterward.
- **Basic servant** (follows instructions, performs labor): Several cups. Pale for days, sleeping hard, eating constantly.
- **Soldier construct** (built for violence): Enough to leave you bedridden for a week. Some crafters need transfusions.
- **Mimic** (passes for human): Crafters have died on the table finishing these, bled out with hands still inside the chest cavity, shaping the last chamber of a heart.

The homunculus must be sparked with **the crafter's own blood**. This is the bond. This is why it serves you and not someone else. Your blood is the signature on the contract.

### Conjuring and Tethering

**Tethering**

A completed homunculus can be bound to a **token**—a small object similar to a Core Binder's anchor. The homunculus was *made* for this token, crafted with the binding built in from the start.

When dormant, the homunculus collapses into the token. Not destroyed—folded. Compressed. Waiting.

Where it waits is unclear. Crafters disagree. Some say the homunculus enters a kind of stasis. Others believe it exists in a pocket dimension tied to the token. Others think it simply ceases to exist until summoned, recreated each time from the pattern stored in the binding.

Nobody knows for certain. The homunculi don't remember dormancy, or if they do, they can't describe it.

**Summoning**

Activate the token, and the homunculus unfolds back into reality.

Fast for simple constructs—they snap into existence almost instantly. Slower for complex ones—they need time to *become*, flesh knitting together, bones locking into place, the body assembling itself from nothing visible.

**Every summoning costs fresh blood.**

The homunculus drinks when it wakes. Small ones need a palm-slice and a minute of feeding. Larger ones need significantly more. A crafter summoning a soldier-construct is opening veins, not cutting palms.

### Upkeep: The Blood Economy

**Daily Feeding**

The token drinks too.

When you collapse a homunculus back to dormancy, the token takes a drop. Just a drop. Daily maintenance, whether you summon that day or not.

- Miss a day: The token goes cold, inert. You'll need a full summoning-price to wake it again.
- Miss a week: The homunculus inside starts to degrade. Patterns corrupting.
- Miss a month: What comes out when you finally feed it won't be what you put in.

A crafter is **always bleeding**. Six constructs means six drops a day, minimum. Morning ritual: a knife and a row of hungry objects.

**The Homunculus Doesn't Care Whose Blood**

It needs the crafter's blood to be *made*. But once it exists, it can be sustained on anyone's.

The temptation is always there:

- You're tapped out, anemic, exhausted
- There's a prisoner in the basement
- There's a beggar who won't be missed
- There's animal blood available (but it makes constructs sluggish, wrong)
- Human blood works best
- *Your* blood works best of all, but you're running out

**The Supply Chain**

Where does the blood come from?

- **Bloodhouses**: Places where the desperate sell by the pint. Technically legal in some jurisdictions. The sellers are gaunt, hollow-eyed, always cold. They don't last long. Fresh ones cycle in. Nobody asks where the old ones went.
- **Wartime crafters**: Military Flesh Shapers have access to prisoners, wounded enemies, civilians in occupied territory. A soldier-construct requires a *lot* of fuel. The supply chain gets dark fast.
- **The black market**: Blood dealers who don't ask questions about sourcing.

**The Homunculus Knows**

It can smell blood. It can tell the difference between:

- Willing and unwilling
- Healthy and sick
- Its maker and a stranger
- Fear-blood and calm-blood

Some crafters swear their constructs behave differently depending on what they've been fed:

- More vicious on fear-blood
- Sluggish on the blood of the drugged
- *Eager* when they've tasted someone they'll meet again

### What This Does to Crafters

**Physical Markers**

- **Pale. Always.** The healthy glow is for people who keep their blood inside.
- **Hungry.** Constantly eating, body trying to rebuild what they keep giving away. They're thin despite the meals.
- **Track marks.** The crook of the elbow, the wrist, anywhere veins are easy to reach. Old scars and fresh wounds.

**Behavioral Changes**

- **Territorial about blood.** Other people's injuries make them *attentive* in uncomfortable ways. A nosebleed at dinner and every crafter in the room goes still for a second.
- **They know things about blood they shouldn't.** Can tell by smell if someone's sick. Can taste pregnancy, disease, fear. The knowledge seeps in. Occupational hazard.

**The Long-Term Cost**

The old ones are brittle. Bones thin. Healing slow. They've given too much for too long.

Some switch to "volunteers" early, preserving themselves at the cost of others. Some hold out until their body forces the choice. Some just... stop making the choice and let a construct drink the last of them.

A Flesh Shaper who's been practicing for decades is a medical wreck held together by stubbornness and careful feeding schedules.

### Hierarchy of Constructs

**Tools**

Simple, single-purpose. A hand that fetches. A mouth that repeats messages. An eye that watches. Barely present—more automation than entity.

Cheap to make, cheap to maintain. Every crafter has a few.

**Servants**

More complex. Can follow multi-step instructions, adapt to obstacles, perform labor. They have enough presence to seem almost like people, though nobody's fooled up close.

The backbone of any serious crafter's stable.

**Soldiers**

Built for violence. Expensive in materials and spark—a soldier-construct might represent months of work and enough blood loss to hospitalize the crafter.

They degrade faster than other types. Combat tears them up, and they don't heal—they have to be *repaired*. Field repairs are crude. Proper maintenance requires a workshop, materials, and more blood.

**Mimics**

The dangerous ones.

Built to pass as human. Built to fool people who know what homunculi look like. Built, sometimes, to impersonate a specific person.

Requirements:

- Exceptional skill
- Massive vitality investment
- Often a core fragment from someone who knew how to *be* a person (burned in the creation, not bound—but the traces remain)

Mimics are assassins' tools. Spies. Replacements.

Most societies ban them outright. Crafters who build them are either very powerful, very well-protected, or very desperate.

### The Homunculus Perspective

**What They Want**

They're made to serve. They don't *want* things the way people do.

Except blood.

Blood is the one drive that's built in, inescapable. A well-fed homunculus is loyal, precise, obedient. A hungry one gets *creative* about fulfilling its primary need.

**Neglected Constructs**

What happens when a homunculus isn't fed properly:

- Returns to dormancy on its own, drinking the token to survive
- Stands very still near sleeping people
- "Accidentally" causes injuries during tasks
- Simply attacks, if starved long enough

This isn't rebellion. It isn't malice. It's just *need*—the only need they have—expressing itself when the leash gets loose.

**Do They Have Experiences?**

Complex homunculi exhibit preferences, aversions, something that looks like pain when damaged. They respond to stimuli in ways that suggest inner states.

But they never lived. They have no history, no childhood, no formation. Whatever they experience, it's not the same as what people experience.

Is it real? Does it matter if it acts real?

Crafters disagree. Some treat their constructs as tools. Some treat them as servants. A few treat them almost as children—made things that deserve consideration despite their origins.

The homunculi themselves don't seem to have opinions on the matter. Or if they do, they don't share them.

### Moral Angle

**What Does Flesh Shaping Exploit?**

1. **The crafter**: Every homunculus costs a piece of you. Noble self-sacrifice or slow suicide dressed as craft?
2. **The materials**: Where do you get the flesh? The bone? Flesh Shapers haunt graveyards, battlefields, slaughterhouses. They make deals with executioners. They show up after disasters with empty carts.
3. **The blood supply**: When your blood runs low, whose do you use? The ethics get murky fast.
4. **The homunculi**: Do they deserve consideration? They experience something. They can suffer, or at least they act like they can. Does their artificial origin excuse how we treat them?

The crafter who says "it's just a construct" sounds a lot like the binder who says "it's just an echo." The rationalization is different. The function is the same.

### Opposition and Social Position

**How Other Practitioners See Them**

- **Core Binders** view Flesh Shapers as butchers playing with corpse-meat. "At least we work with what *was*. You're just... building things out of scraps."
- **Pact Summoners** don't understand why anyone would work so hard when you could just make a deal.
- **Fate Threaders** see them as limited—"You can only make what you can build."
- **Colony Summoners** and Flesh Shapers have professional overlap. Some respect. Some rivalry. Similar materials, different methods.

**Public Perception**

Flesh Shapers are openly unsettling. Their workshops smell like death. Everyone knows where the materials come from.

In some places, they're tolerated as necessary—military applications, dangerous labor, tasks nobody else will do.

In others, they're shunned. The craft is legal but shameful. You hire one when you need one, and you don't invite them to dinner.

**Legal Status**

Regulation focuses on the *crafter*, not the product:

- Licensing requirements
- Restrictions on mimic construction
- Blood sourcing laws (where they exist)
- Limits on military applications

The homunculus itself isn't a citizen, was never a citizen, can't become a citizen. It's property. What happens to it is the crafter's business, as long as the crafter follows the rules.

## [Pact Summoning](the_five_arts.md#pact-summoning)

<div style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">The Art of Dealing with the Outside</div>

### Fundamental Principle

Somewhere adjacent to reality, things exist. Not dead things—Core Binding covers the dead. Not made things—Flesh Shaping builds those. These are entities that *are*, fully and independently, in a place that isn't here.


The **[Elsewhere](../metaphysics/additional_systems.md)** is what practitioners call that place. The entities there have their own drives, their own intelligence, their own agendas. For reasons nobody fully understands, some of them are willing to answer when called.

Pact Summoning is negotiation. Unlike the other Arts, you're not in control. You're making a deal with something that has its own reasons for saying yes.

### The Elsewhere

**What It Is**

Mystery is load-bearing here. The Elsewhere isn't mapped, isn't understood, isn't safe to investigate.

What's known:

- **It's not an afterlife.** The dead don't go there. Cores don't come from there.
- **It's not a spirit world.** It's not a reflection of our reality. It's somewhere genuinely alien.
- **Time works differently.** Entities reference events that haven't happened yet. They remember pacts made with summoners' ancestors—ancestors who haven't made those pacts yet, by our timeline.
- **Space is wrong.** The few descriptions from people who claim to have glimpsed it are contradictory. Too many angles. Colors that hurt. Distance that doesn't correlate with movement.

The entities there aren't gods. Aren't demons in a religious sense. Aren't faeries in a folkloric sense. Different cultures use all those words, but none of them are accurate.

They're *other*. Intelligences that evolved—if "evolved" means anything there—in a place with different rules than ours.

**Why They Answer**

Unknown. Theories:

- They want something from our world that they can't get otherwise
- Our reality is entertainment, or food, or raw material
- They're curious
- They're compelled by the calling ritual (unlikely—they can choose not to respond)
- Different entities have different reasons

The uncertainty is part of the horror. You're dealing with something, and you don't know why it's dealing with you.

### The Pact

**Formation**

Making a pact requires contact:

- **Rituals**: Specific words, gestures, offerings that attract attention from the Elsewhere
- **Thin places**: Locations where the boundary between here and there is weak
- **Resonant objects**: Items that have been touched by Elsewhere influence, that carry traces of prior contact
- **Bloodlines**: Families that have dealt before. The connection persists across generations. The entities remember.

The entity *chooses* whether to engage. You can call. It doesn't have to answer. Some calls go unanswered for years. Some are answered immediately. Some are answered by something other than what you were trying to reach.

**Negotiation**

Pact terms are negotiated. Both parties bring something to the table.

The entity is at least as intelligent as you. Probably more intelligent. Certainly more experienced—it's been doing this longer than your civilization has existed.

The pact, once formed, binds both sides. Break it and there are consequences. For you. Possibly for the entity too, which is why they're careful about terms.

**The Price Is You**

The entity wants your **core**. The same thing a Core Binder would harvest from your corpse. But the Elsewhere entity takes it in installments.

Every summoning. Every use of the pact's power. Every favor called in. Each one costs a piece of you.

You feel it:

- A coldness that doesn't warm
- Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix
- The sense that you're *less* than you were yesterday, in a way you can't name

**The Honest Horror**

Pact entities are honest. That's part of what makes them terrifying.

No tricks. No hidden clauses. No surprises. The entity tells you exactly what's going to happen: *I will eat you, slowly, and in exchange you get this.*

And people say yes anyway.

### The Math of Desperation

**Why Would Anyone Agree?**

- **Power now, death later.** For someone with nothing, that's a trade worth making. You get decades of capability in exchange for a shorter life. If your life was going to be short and powerless anyway, this is an upgrade.
- **The timeline is negotiable.** Small pacts, small bites. Use the power sparingly, and you might get decades before the debt comes due. Use it constantly, and you might have months.
- **Some people don't plan to live long anyway.** Soldiers. Assassins. The terminally ill. The suicidal. The entity offers a way to *matter* before the end.
- **Arrogance.** The belief that you'll find a way out. That you're smarter than everyone who came before. That you'll be the one to beat the system.

You won't be. But you'll believe it until you don't.

### Substitution

**You Can Pay with Other People's Souls**

You can only offer your own core to *one* entity. That's your primary pact. But you can offset your debt by providing other cores.

The entity doesn't care whose core it gets. A core is a core. But you have to *deliver*.

**Classic Arrangements**

- **First-born clauses**: The child isn't born yet. You're mortgaging a future you can't see. By the time the debt comes due, you've had years to love what you promised away.
- **Seventh son of a seventh son**: Rare cores are worth more. One exceptional soul might buy you years off your own debt.
- **Designated sacrifices**: Prisoners. Slaves. The defeated. If you can deliver someone's core to the entity, it counts. How you get it is your problem.

**Secondary Markets**

This creates economies within economies:

- Pact summoners hunting for substitutes
- Cults breeding or kidnapping to pay their founders' debts
- Wars fought partly to generate currency for Elsewhere transactions
- Noble families trading heirs' futures for political advantage
- Criminal organizations offering "debt relief" in exchange for *services*

The entities don't judge. They just collect.

### Breaking the Pact

**You Can't**

The terms are the terms. You agreed. The entity will collect what it's owed, one way or another.

**However**

- **The entity can die.** They're not gods. They're powerful, alien, long-lived—but not immortal. Kill your pact-partner and the contract dissolves. You keep whatever's left of your core.

  This is rare. Elsewhere entities are hard to find when they don't want to be found. Harder to hurt when they're found. They know they have enemies, and they're careful.

  But it happens. Some summoners spend their entire lives searching for a way to kill what they owe.
- **Other entities might help.** Faction politics in the Elsewhere mean your creditor's enemies might be willing to deal. You could trade one pact for another. One master for another. Out of the pot, into the fire.
- **Early collection.** If the entity decides you're more trouble than you're worth, it can call the debt due. All of it. At once. You don't survive that. But at least you're not in debt anymore.

**Evil Genie Escapes**

It *does* happen—rarely—that someone wriggles out through a loophole. A technicality. A desperate gambit the entity didn't anticipate.

These cases become legends. They're also why entities have gotten very, very good at writing airtight terms over the millennia.

If you think you've found a loophole, you probably haven't. The entity has seen your trick before. Usually from someone much smarter than you.

### The Summoning

**What Happens When You Call**

The entity arrives. Not from an anchor, not from a token—it *manifests*. The transition is visible. Uncomfortable to witness.

- Air pressure changes
- Light bends wrong, casting shadows that don't match objects
- Temperature shifts—sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes both in different parts of the room
- The smell of somewhere else. No one can describe it. Everyone recognizes it.

**The Relationship**

The entity isn't your servant. It's your *contractor*.

It does what the pact specifies. If you negotiated well, that's a lot. If you didn't, it might technically fulfill the letter while violating the spirit. It knows every trick you know, and many you don't.

Duration and power depend on pact terms and what you've paid recently. Use the connection sparingly, and you get modest manifestations. Burn through your remaining soul fast, and you can call forth something terrifying.

The entity can refuse if you're asking for something outside the agreement. It can renegotiate. It can leave if the terms allow.

You're not its master. You're its customer. There's a difference.

### What They Look Like

**It Varies**

Appearance depends on faction, individual nature, and possibly what your mind can process:

- **Geometric**: Wrong angles. Shapes that fold in directions that don't exist. Looking at them too long makes your eyes water.
- **Almost biological**: Too many limbs. Limbs that aren't limbs. A face close enough to human to be worse than something completely alien.
- **Sensory rather than visual**: A sound that has location. A pressure that has opinions. A smell that watches you.
- **Changing**: Different every time you see them. Or exactly the same, down to the shadow, no matter the lighting.

Summoners in the same faction's service sometimes recognize each other's patrons. Like spotting a uniform. Or a brand.

### Contamination

**You're in Contact with the Outside**

You're not just paying with your core. The connection itself marks you.

**Manifestations**

1. **Perception shifts**: The boundary thins for you. You see cracks in reality where others see solid walls. Glimpses of Elsewhere bleeding through at odd moments. Dreams that aren't dreams.
2. **Resonance**: Other entities notice you. You're marked as someone who deals. Some are curious. Some are hungry. Some are your patron's enemies, looking for leverage.
3. **Faction drift**: Your patron's nature echoes in you. Not memories like Core Binding's bleed—*tendencies*. You start wanting what they want. Valuing what they value. The longer the pact, the more you serve their interests without being asked.
4. **The door**: If you've given access as part of your terms, you're not always sure when it's open. Gaps in your memory. Actions you don't remember taking. The question of who's driving.

### The Consumed

**When Your Core Is Gone**

When a summoner's debt is fully collected:

**The body is still there. The soul is gone.**

What remains varies:

- A husk that breathes, blinks, maybe eats if you put food in its mouth. But nobody's home.
- Or something's *moved in*. The entity, or a piece of it, using the empty vessel. Looking out through human eyes.
- Or the body just stops. Heart keeps beating for a while, then doesn't. No violence, no unusual decay. Just vacancy, then nothing.

Different factions leave different remains:

- The Hungry leave bodies that look *starved*—not thin, just emptied
- The Mirrors leave bodies that don't move right anymore, like something's trying to remember how limbs work
- The Absent leave bodies that are simply... gone. There one moment, not there the next. No one sees them leave.

## The Elsewhere Factions

The entities aren't unified. They have allegiances, rivalries, territories. The politics are opaque to humans—we catch glimpses. Wars referenced obliquely. Names spoken with something like fear. Requests that clearly serve some larger game.

The full picture is never given. You're a pawn who doesn't know the board.

### The Accountants

**What They Want**: *Order*

Not justice. Not fairness. *Ledgers that balance.* Every debt paid. Every promise kept. Every exchange recorded.

They invented the pact structure. The contract format. The terms and conditions. Other factions adopted their framework because it works.

**Characteristics**

- They don't care what you do with the power. They care that the price is paid on time.
- Their summoners tend toward obsessive record-keeping. Counting things. Needing symmetry. Uncomfortable when anything is unbalanced.
- They might be the "safest" to deal with—predictable, honorable in their way. But their honor is the honor of a loan shark. Miss a payment and they take what's owed, plus interest.

**What They're Really After**

Unknown. Possibly they're building something. A structure. A pattern. Every soul a brick in a wall no one can see.

### The Hungry

**What They Want**: *Sensation*

Our world is dense with feeling—physical, emotional, experiential. The Elsewhere is thin. These entities are starving.

**Characteristics**

- Pacts often include clauses about *experiencing*. The summoner has to feel things—intensely—and the entity feeds on it.
- Their summoners tend toward extremes. Thrill-seekers, hedonists, masochists. People who burn bright because something's drinking the flame.
- They're generous with power because they're getting paid in real-time. Every time you use the gift, you *feel* something, and they're right there, mouth open.

**What They're Really After**

More. Always more. They might not be collecting souls for any purpose beyond consumption. Just *eating*. And they're never full.

### The Architects

**What They Want**: *Change*

Specific changes. Moves in a game being played across centuries. They give orders that seem arbitrary—stand here, say this, kill him, spare her—and the pattern only becomes visible generations later.

**Characteristics**

- Their summoners are pieces on a board. Useful, but not privy to the strategy.
- The contamination is subtle. You start *thinking* in long timelines. Personal goals feel small. You catch yourself making decisions that serve something larger, and you can't explain why.
- They might be at war with each other. Or cooperating on something vast. The summoner never knows which.

**What They're Really After**

The board to look a certain way. Our world reshaped. Not conquered—*adjusted*. Every soul they collect might be a piece removed from play.

### The Mirrors

**What They Want**: *Identity*

They're fascinated by selfhood—the thing that makes you *you* and not someone else. They collect cores not as currency but as specimens. Art. Components of something they're building or becoming.

**Characteristics**

- Pacts often include clauses about *access*. They want to wear you sometimes. See through your eyes. Make your choices. Not possession exactly—more like borrowing.
- Their summoners have the worst contamination: identity bleed. Am I me? Was that my thought? When I wanted that, was it *me* wanting?
- They might be trying to *become* something. Using human cores as templates. Building a self out of stolen pieces.

**What They're Really After**

To be what we are. Or to understand it. Or to take it apart and see how it works. The souls they collect might be raw material for constructing something that can finally *be*.

### The Absent

**What They Want**: *Nothing*

That's what makes them terrifying. No demands, no hungers, no apparent agenda. They answer when called. They fulfill their terms. They collect what's owed. They never explain why.

**Characteristics**

- Pacts with them are simple, clean, almost generous. Which makes experienced summoners deeply suspicious.
- Their summoners report the least contamination—but also the least *contact*. The entity does the job and leaves. No presence, no pressure, no bleeding through.

**What They're Really After**

The only honest answer is "we don't know." That might be the most dangerous answer of all.

### Faction Dynamics

- **The Accountants vs. The Architects**: Most friction. One wants every debt balanced *now*. The other lets ledgers run for centuries if it serves the plan.
- **The Hungry**: Looked down on by the others. Addicts. No sophistication. Just *appetite*.
- **The Mirrors**: Feared. What they're doing with the cores is wrong even by Elsewhere standards.
- **The Absent**: Make everyone nervous. You can't predict what you can't understand.

### What Happens to Collected Souls

Unknown. Load-bearing mystery.

Hints:

- **The Accountants** file them. Somewhere. For something.
- **The Hungry** consume them. Gone. Used up. Fuel.
- **The Architects** place them. Pieces on a board. Maybe still aware.
- **The Mirrors** wear them. Incorporate them. The entity you're dealing with might be partly made of collected cores.
- **The Absent**: Nobody knows. Nobody's ever found out.

## [Fate Threading](the_five_arts.md#fate-threading)

## The Art of Spending Tomorrow

### Fundamental Principle

Your future spreads ahead of you like roots seeking water. Every significant choice you'll face branches into potential futures. Potential *yous*.

Fate Threading is the art of reaching into those branches and pulling. You grab a version of yourself from a choice you haven't made yet, drag them into the present, and make them real.

The cost: that choice is gone. The path closes behind you. You will never become that person naturally—you already extracted them.

You're not mining your history. You're cannibalizing your becoming.

### The Core Rule

**Only Yourself. Only Forward.**

You can only pull versions of *yourself* from *future* fate-lines. No one else. Nothing from the past.

- **No past-branch access.** You decided not to become a soldier at eighteen. That soldier-you doesn't exist anymore. The choice was made. The branch collapsed.
- **Only forward potential.** You can pull from decisions you *will* face. The you that takes the job next month. The you that kills the man threatening your family tomorrow. The you that says yes to a proposal you haven't received yet.
- **Always impacting your future.** Every pull severs a path you could still walk. The web of your possibilities gets narrower with each extraction.

### The Mechanism

**Sensing Fate**

Threaders can feel their fate-web. Not clearly—more like sensing pressure. Weight.

- Heavy futures: almost certain, highly probable, rich with consequence
- Light futures: unlikely, dependent on many contingencies, wispy
- Close futures: imminent choices, easy to grasp
- Distant futures: far-off possibilities, harder to reach

**Pulling**

You reach forward. Focus on a choice-point. Feel the version of yourself that exists down that path. And *pull*.

The extraction isn't gentle. It feels like tearing something out of yourself—because you are. That potential was part of you. Now it's standing next to you, a separate person.

**The Closure**

The path closes behind the pull. That choice-point is spent.

When you reach that moment naturally—the job offer, the marriage proposal, the crossroads—the option you pulled from won't exist. You'll have to take a different path, or no path at all.

### What You Can Pull

Any version of yourself that could exist based on choices you haven't made yet.

**Examples**

- **Tomorrow you face a duel.** You can pull the you who wins—skilled, confident, bloody-handed. (You cannot pull the you who dies. Dead futures contain nothing to extract.)
- **Next year you might take a job with a merchant house.** You can pull the you who spent a decade there, learned the trade, made the connections. But then you'll never be able to take that job naturally—the future's already been harvested.
- **You're considering marriage.** You can pull the you who said yes, lived that life, raised those children. But if you pull the married-you, you've spent that future. You might still marry her, but it won't be the same. That fate-line is corrupted.

### What You Cannot Pull

- **Past branches.** You didn't become a soldier. That soldier doesn't exist. Gone forever.
- **Dead futures.** If a fate-line ends in your death, there's nothing to extract. Death isn't a version of you. It's the absence of you.
- **Other people.** Your fate-web contains connections to others, but you can't pull *them*. Only yourself.
- **Selves from others' webs.** Your brother's potential futures are his. Even if your fates are entangled, you can only pull from your own branches.

### The Brutal Math

**Youth Is Wealth**

Young threaders have wide webs. Lots of major choices ahead. Lots of potential selves to pull.

Old threaders have narrow webs. Most choices are behind them. Most branches already collapsed through living, not pulling.

**The Narrowing**

A threader who pulls aggressively in youth might find themselves at forty with almost no remaining futures. They've spent their potential. What's left is a thin line leading to a handful of possible deaths—and that's it.

Every year you live, your web narrows naturally. Every pull accelerates that narrowing. The combination is a countdown.

### The Costs

**Aging**

Each pull costs years. Your body knows you're spending future.

Hair grays. Joints ache. Skin thins. Heavy threaders look decades older than their actual age. The body is keeping score, even if the mind tries to ignore it.

**Coherence**

You're supposed to *become* those selves. That's how identity works—you make choices, and you become the person who made them.

When you rip them out prematurely, you become less. The sense of who you are gets foggy. Heavy threaders lose track of their own identity—too many versions of themselves walking around, too many futures cashed out early.

Some forget their own names. Not amnesia—something stranger. They know they have a name. They just aren't sure which one is theirs and which one belongs to an extraction.

**Narrowing Web**

Every pull closes a path. The more you pull, the fewer futures remain.

Eventually you're looking at a fate-web that's almost empty. Just the thin line of your remaining lifespan, no branches, no choices that matter, no potential left.

This is visible to other threaders. A depleted fate-web looks like a dying tree—sparse, brittle, few leaves.

**Anchoring Load**

The extracted selves are tethered to you. You're their origin point, and they need that connection to remain stable.

While you live, they're coherent. Pull too many and your anchoring spreads thin. Neglected selves start to degrade—memories corrupting, identity fragmenting.

Soft cap: six to ten stable extractions, depending on the threader's strength. Push past that and they start going wrong.

### The Extracted Self

They're *you*. From a choice you haven't made yet.

**What They Know**

They have your memories up to now—the shared past you both lived. Then they have memories of the life they *would have lived*, down the fate-line you pulled them from.

- The soldier-you remembers the war you never fought. Knows the friends you never made, the enemies you never killed.
- The scholar-you remembers the books you never read. Knows the languages you never learned.
- They know things you don't. Skills you don't have. Experiences you skipped.

**What They Feel**

They're you. But they're also *not* you anymore.

- **Loyal**: They understand what you did, why you needed them. They're willing to help because you're the same person, fundamentally.
- **Resentful**: They had a *life*. It wasn't real yet, but it was going to be. You stole it. Collapsed their entire existence into *serving* the version that got to keep the body.
- **Superior**: The king-you looks at present-you and sees a lesser version. Unfinished. Unpolished. Why should he take orders from his own rough draft?
- **Pitying**: The happy-you, the peaceful-you, the one who got out—they look at you and see someone still trapped in the mess they escaped.

**What They Can Do**

Anything you could do, if you'd made their choices. They have real skills, real knowledge, real capabilities.

But they're not summoned tools. They're *people*. They make their own decisions, have their own opinions, pursue their own goals.

You can ask them to help. You can try to convince them. You can't *control* them.

### Death of an Extracted Self

When they die, that fate-line is destroyed. Not blocked—*gone*.

- You will never become that person. That potential is spent and destroyed.
- Whatever they knew, whatever they could do, is lost.
- The choice-point they came from? When you reach it naturally, it won't exist as an option anymore. You took it off the table by pulling and losing them.

**Implications**

- Protecting your extractions matters. They're not disposable.
- Old threaders are cautious. They've lost extractions before. They know the cost.
- Suicide as weapon. An extraction that wants to hurt you can do it by dying. Kill themselves, and they take a piece of your future with them.
- Murder as fate-destruction. If someone kills your extractions, they're not just killing people—they're *unmaking your possibilities*.

### Your Death

If you die, your extracted selves drift.

- Memories corrupt over weeks or months
- Identity fragments. They forget their unlived lives.
- Eventually they become echoes. Walking, talking, but not coherent. Not quite people anymore.

Some extracted selves will do anything to keep you alive. You're not just their origin—you're their coherence. Without you, they dissolve.

### The Horror

You're always eating your future.

Every pull means: *I will never become that person naturally. I will never walk that path. I will never make that choice and see where it leads.*

Young threaders have options. Old threaders have regrets.

The oldest threaders—the ones who pulled too much—are ghosts before they die. No future left. Just the thin present moment, and the handful of selves they extracted before the well ran dry.

And those selves? They know what you did. They know you spent their futures to get their skills, their knowledge, their help.

Some forgive you. Some serve you.

Some wait.

## [Colony Summoning](the_five_arts.md#colony-summoning)

## The Art of Growing What You've Eaten

### Fundamental Principle

You carry a fungal colony inside you. It has eaten the dead. It remembers what it consumed. When you summon, you *fruit*—push the colony's biomass out of your body, shaped by the pattern of something it has previously decomposed.

You are the garden. The dead are the seeds. What grows serves you—mostly.

### The Colony

**What It Is**

A symbiotic fungal organism threaded through your body. Mycelium wrapped around your organs, woven into your muscles, nested in your gut. It's been there since infection—possibly since birth, if your bloodline carries the strain.

It's not intelligent. Not exactly. But it *remembers*. Chemically, structurally. Every dead thing it has ever broken down is stored as a pattern, a template, a set of instructions for reconstruction.

**How You Get One**

Three paths:

1. **Inheritance**: Some bloodlines have carried colonies for generations. The fungus passes from parent to child—in the womb, through nursing, through deliberate ritual feeding. These colonies are old, rich with patterns, heavy with the dead of your ancestors.
2. **Implantation**: Deliberate infection. Consume a prepared culture. Inhale spores from an established host. Let someone cut you and pack the wound with living mycelium. The colony takes root over weeks—painful weeks, as it learns your body and you learn its hunger.
3. **Wild infection**: Rare and dangerous. Wild strains aren't adapted to human hosts. They might consume you instead of partnering. But they also haven't been domesticated, limited, bred for obedience. Wild hosts are unstable and powerful.

**The Relationship**

You and the colony aren't one being. You're partners—sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing.

- **Communication**: Chemical, not verbal. You feel what it needs. Hunger. Satiation. Readiness. Reluctance. Over time you learn to interpret its states, and it learns yours.
- **Negotiation**: It wants to be fed. It wants to fruit. It wants to spread. Satisfy those drives and it cooperates fully. Deny them and it starts taking what it needs.
- **Conflict**: You can suppress the colony. Starve it, deny it, fight its urges. This is painful for both. Long-term suppression can damage the colony—or you.

### Feeding the Colony

**The Core Rule**

The colony can only summon what it has consumed. No pattern, no summon.

**The Consumption Process**

- Feed the colony dead things. Corpses, carcasses, any organic matter that was once alive.
- The colony breaks it down over hours to days, depending on size. A rat takes hours. A human takes days. A horse takes a week.
- During decomposition, the colony absorbs the *pattern*—the biological blueprint.
- The physical matter is processed into nutrients. You benefit from this. Hosts who feed their colonies regularly need less food otherwise.

**What You Can Feed It**

- **Animals**: Common, easy, socially acceptable (mostly). A well-maintained colony has consumed dozens of creatures.
- **Humans**: Richer patterns, more useful for complex summons. Also murder, or at minimum corpse acquisition.
- **Other hosts**: A colony that consumes another colony gains its patterns. This is how strains merge, compete, and evolve. It's also how wars between hosts end.
- **Parts**: You don't need the whole thing. A hand gives you a hand-pattern. A heart gives you a heart. Useful for specialists.

**Storage Limits**

The colony can only hold so many patterns clearly. Old patterns degrade.

- Recent consumption (weeks): clear patterns, high-fidelity summons
- Older consumption (months): degraded patterns, approximate summons
- Ancient consumption (years): fragmentary patterns, partial summons

Hosts who want to keep a pattern fresh have to *re-feed* periodically. Kill another one of the same thing. Refresh the template.

### The Summoning (Fruiting)

**The Process**

1. You call a pattern. Will it, focus on it, reach into the colony's memory.
2. The colony responds—if willing, if it has the pattern, if you have the biomass.
3. Fruiting begins. Mycelium pushes outward through skin, mouth, wounds. Uncomfortable to agonizing depending on size.
4. The biomass shapes itself according to the stored pattern.
5. The summon separates. Stands, moves, exists as an independent organism—connected to you, but physically distinct.

**What Comes Out**

A fungal reconstruction of whatever the colony consumed.

- Shape of the original. Structure. Proportions.
- Approximate capabilities. A summoned wolf can run and bite. A summoned soldier can fight.
- No original mind. The colony's *impression* of behavior, filtered through chemical memory.
- Looks *wrong*. Fibrous flesh. Pale or mottled coloring. No blood—cut it and it leaks clear fluid. Faces that approximate features without achieving them.

**The Tether**

The summon remains connected.

- You sense what it senses, dimly.
- It follows your intentions, mostly. Colony drives lurk underneath.
- Distance matters. Close summons are responsive. Distant ones get autonomous.
- Severed tether doesn't vanish the summon—it just stops being *yours*.

### The Costs

**Biomass**

The summon is made from *you*.

- Small summons: a meal's worth. Hungry, lightheaded afterward.
- Medium summons: several meals. Gaunt, shaky.
- Large summons: dangerous. Pulling from muscle, reserves, things you need.
- Multiple summons: multiplicative cost.

**Recovery**

After dismissing or reabsorbing:

- Eating. A lot. Protein, fat, minerals.
- Time. Days for large summons.
- The colony's cut. Not everything comes back. Long-term summoners are *lighter* than they should be.

**The Colony's Demands**

When it's not satisfied:

- **Hunger**: Craving dead things. Compulsion to seek corpses.
- **Fruiting pressure**: The need to externalize. Suppress too long and it might fruit involuntarily.
- **Spread drive**: The colony wants new hosts. You start noticing people as *candidates*.

### Reabsorption and Dismissal

**Reabsorption**

Pull the biomass back in. Reverse fruiting.

- Recovers *some* of what you spent.
- Uncomfortable. Something crawling back inside.
- Takes time. Minutes to longer.
- Damaged summons bring damage back with them.

**Decomposition**

If you won't reabsorb:

- Fast breakdown. Hours.
- Messy. Collapses into fungal matter.
- Wasteful. No biomass recovery.

**Abandonment**

Leave a summon active indefinitely:

- It feeds itself. Hunting, scavenging.
- It might grow. Add biomass.
- It might reproduce. Spread spores.
- It stops being yours. Feral.

### What Hosts Look Like

**Physical Signs**

- Pale or grayish undertone. Mycelium shows through.
- Faint patterning visible in certain light.
- Run cool. The colony takes heat.
- Smell of loam, petrichor, hint of decay.
- Eyes develop cloudiness over time.

**Behavioral Signs**

- Constant eating. Protein and fat. Stay thin despite it.
- Drawn to dead things. Notice corpses. Have to resist acquiring.
- Touch people differently. Assessing. The colony is interested in new hosts.

**The Old Ones**

Decades of hosting:

- More mycelium than meat.
- Don't think quite like humans. Colony priorities seeped in.
- Some stop being human-shaped between summonings. Framework for fruiting.

## System Interactions

## Cross-Practice Dynamics

The Five Arts don't exist in isolation. Practitioners encounter each other, compete, cooperate, and sometimes attempt to combine techniques.

### How Practitioners View Each Other

|                                   | Core Binding                  | Flesh Shaping                | Pact Summoning             | Fate Threading                | Colony Summoning              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Core Binders think...**   | —                            | "Butchers playing with meat" | "Fools selling themselves" | "Clever but limited"          | "Disgusting parasites"        |
| **Flesh Shapers think...**  | "Sentimental prisoners"       | —                           | "Cheaters who buy power"   | "Interesting but impractical" | "Similar work, cruder method" |
| **Pact Summoners think...** | "Small ambitions"             | "Too much work"              | —                         | "Eating themselves"           | "At least they chose it"      |
| **Fate Threaders think...** | "Dependent on others' deaths" | "Limited by skill"           | "Mortgaged to outsiders"   | —                            | "Gave up their body"          |
| **Colony Hosts think...**   | "We both use the dead"        | "Professional kinship"       | "Dangerous deals"          | "Lonely method"               | —                            |

### Can Systems Combine?

**Core Binding + Pact Summoning**

If a pact summoner dies, is there a core to harvest?

*Depends on how much is left.* A summoner who's been paying for decades might leave a core so thin it's barely usable. Or nothing at all. Duds—empty, immediately gone upon death.

Or the core is pulled to the Elsewhere. Something happens to it there. This might be the thing we don't understand.

**Flesh Shaping + Pact Summoning**

Could you spark a homunculus with a pact summoner's diminished core?

What would that create? Would the entity still have a claim?

**Elsewhere Entities + Core Binding**

The entities have no cores. They're from outside. The rules of death here don't apply.

You can't bind one. Can't harvest one. They're outside the economy that governs everything else. That's part of why they're dangerous.

**Fate Threading + Other Arts**

Can you pull a version of yourself that practiced a different Art?

Yes. And they'd come with the knowledge and corruption of that practice. The Flesh Shaper-you is pale and hungry. The Core Binder-you has echoes bleeding into them. The Pact Summoner-you might still owe something to an entity.

**Colony + Core Binding**

Can a colony consume a practitioner and gain something from their practice?

Unknown. Colonies gain patterns, not abilities. But a Flesh Shaper's pattern might include something about blood-affinity. A Core Binder's pattern might include traces of their echoes.

The interactions haven't been thoroughly explored. They're dangerous to test.

## The Universal Truth

Every Art in Hálcova operates on the same principle:

**You must spend something real to gain something real.**

The currency varies:

- The dead and your sense of self (Core Binding)
- Blood and your humanity (Flesh Shaping)
- Your soul in installments (Pact Summoning)
- Your future possibilities (Fate Threading)
- Your body and autonomy (Colony Summoning)

But the transaction is always the same. Power has a price. The universe keeps ledgers. The debt always comes due.

Welcome to Hálcova. The world between deaths. The place where everything is owed.
