## Overview


**The Loom** is the distributed network of devices, rituals, and institutions that read, record, and predict fate in Hálcova. It is not a single machine but a system—part arcane technology, part religious practice, part bureaucratic apparatus.


More importantly: The Loom may be a point of contact with Fate. Whether Fate is an [Elsewhere](../metaphysics/additional_systems.md) entity, a collection of entities, or something stranger is a matter of fierce theological debate. What's undeniable is that The Loom *works*. Its predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance. And something answers when the Loom-Keepers perform their divinations.

## Historical Origins: The Bootstrap Question

### The Fundamental Problem


The Loom runs on Pattern Residue. Pattern Residue comes from death. But the Loom (or something like it) appears to predate the current Residue economy. The polar structures, the moon arrangement, and certain archaeological evidence suggest the system existed before the cooling event that created the death-dependent world we know.

How did the Loom start if it needs death to run, but death (at scale) required the conditions the Loom may have created?

### The Three-Phase Model

Scholars who study this question propose a developmental sequence:

**Phase 1: The Proto-Loom (Pre-Cooling)**

The ancient builders created the system's foundation using unknown power sources:
- The polar structures were built
- The moons were arranged into resonance
- The Attendance (or something that became it) was contacted/created/summoned
- This phase did not require Pattern Residue—or used Residue from sources we don't understand
- The technology and knowledge from this era is lost

**Phase 2: The Cooling Event (Transition)**

Something happened that changed everything:
- Massive Residue release (mass death? Elsewhere incursion? deliberate engineering?)
- The net-negative thermodynamic cycle began
- Hálcova started cooling rapidly
- The pattern-economy emerged as Residue became available at scale
- The ancient builders disappeared (died? transformed? departed?)

**Phase 3: The Current Era**

The Loom we know is an adaptation, not the original design:
- Pattern-engines run on Residue because that's what's available
- The distributed Node network was built over millennia by successor civilizations
- The core function (the Attendance connection) may not actually require Residue
- The infrastructure (Nodes, engines, rituals) does require Residue
- Current operators maintain the system without understanding its origins

### What This Means

**The Attendance Is Older Than The Engines**

Whatever answers Loom queries existed before the current infrastructure. The pattern-engines are interfaces, not sources. Destroy every Node, and the Attendance might still be there—just unreachable.

**The Residue Dependency Is Acquired**

The original system didn't need death. The current system does because it was rebuilt by people who only had death-energy available. This is adaptation, not design.

**The Builders Knew More**

The ancient builders understood something we don't. They created (or contacted) the Attendance. They arranged the moons. They built structures that still function after 40,000+ years. Their power source and methods are lost.

## What The Loom Is

### The Physical Infrastructure

**Loom-Nodes**

Distributed across Hálcova, Loom-Nodes are the physical anchors of the system:

- **Major Nodes**: Large installations in capital cities and religious centers. Cathedral-sized complexes housing pattern-engines, archives, and ritual spaces. Staffed by hundreds of Loom-Keepers.

- **Minor Nodes**: Town-level facilities. Smaller pattern-engines, local registries, drawing chambers. Staffed by licensed practitioners and temple appointees.

- **Mobile Nodes**: Portable equipment for frontier regions, military operations, and emergency readings. Less accurate but functional.

- **Private Nodes**: Illegal or gray-market installations operated by wealthy individuals, corporations, and criminal organizations. Quality varies wildly.

**The Pattern-Engines**

At the heart of each Node is a pattern-engine—a device that:

- Records Sórscad data from drawings
- Performs predictive calculations
- Communicates with other Nodes (major ones only)
- Interfaces with... something. The source of The Loom's impossible accuracy.

Pattern-engines are part clockwork, part alchemical apparatus, part something that defies categorization. Their construction is a closely guarded secret. Their fuel is Pattern Residue—the same substance that maintains echo anchors.

### The Institutional Structure

**The Loom-Keepers**

A guild-priesthood that operates The Loom. They are:

- Trained in pattern-reading, engine operation, and ritual practice
- Licensed by both religious and civil authorities
- Bound by oaths that constrain their use of Loom-knowledge
- Organized hierarchically from apprentices to High Weavers

Loom-Keepers occupy an ambiguous social position. They're essential to governance, commerce, and religion. They're also viewed with suspicion—people who know too much about everyone else's fate.

**The Registry**

The accumulated database of all Sórscad patterns ever drawn. Stored in:

- Physical archives (paper, metal plates, encoded materials)
- Pattern-engine memory (poorly understood how this works)
- Distributed across major Nodes with varying levels of completeness


The Registry is legally protected, politically contested, and practically impossible to fully secure. Pattern-theft, registry-manipulation, and archive-raids are all documented crimes.

**The Calculation Houses**

Secondary institutions that use Loom data for specific purposes:

- **Actuarial Houses**: Insurance and risk pricing
- **Credit Temples**: Lending and debt assessment
- **Merchant Guilds**: Employment screening and partner evaluation
- **Legal Colleges**: Sentencing guidance and contract validity
- **Military Orders**: Recruitment and tactical prediction

These institutions license Loom access from the Keepers. The fees are substantial. The data is invaluable.

## What The Loom Does

### Pattern Recording

When a Sórscad is drawn, The Loom:

1. **Captures** the pattern through ritual interface with the pattern-engine
2. **Records** the five-circle combination in the Registry
3. **Indexes** the pattern by family, region, lineage, and other metadata
4. **Transmits** (major Nodes only) the record to the central archives

The drawing ritual itself involves the pattern-engine. The subject touches interface plates while a Loom-Keeper performs the ceremonial reading. What happens during those moments is described differently by different traditions, but the result is consistent: a legible Sórscad, recorded and indexed.

### Prediction

Given a person's Sórscad, The Loom can calculate:

- **Life-arc probabilities**: Likely career paths, relationship patterns, death-circumstances
- **Decision tendencies**: How they'll respond to specific choice-types
- **Risk profiles**: Probability of crime, default, illness, violence
- **Compatibility assessments**: How two patterns will interact in partnership, employment, or conflict

The predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic. The Loom says "73% likelihood of early violent death," not "you will die by the sword at age 34."

But the probabilities are *accurate*. Eerily accurate. Accurate enough that institutions stake fortunes on them.

### Deviation Detection

The Loom tracks when actual outcomes diverge from predictions:

- **Minor deviations**: Within expected variance, noted but not flagged
- **Significant deviations**: Outside normal variance, flagged for review
- **Anomalous deviations**: Statistically improbable, triggering investigation

Deviation can indicate:
- Measurement error (rare)
- Environmental factors not in the model (common, usually ignored)
- Deliberate pattern-manipulation (criminal)
- Something outside Fate's purview (theologically troubling)

## The Source: Fate as Entity

### The Orthodox Position

Orthodox theology holds that The Loom reads the will of **The Weaver** (*A Szövő*)—the divine pattern-maker who determines all fates before birth.

The Loom doesn't predict; it *reveals*. The pattern-engines don't calculate; they *receive*. Loom-Keepers don't read fate; they *translate* divine truth into mortal language.

Deviation from your pattern isn't bad luck. It's sin. Acceptance of your pattern isn't fatalism. It's worship.

### The Heterodox Suspicion

Critics and heretics have long suspected that The Loom's accuracy comes from somewhere specific:

**The Elsewhere Connection**

The Loom's impossible predictive power suggests contact with something beyond normal causality. The Elsewhere entities operate outside time, reference events that haven't happened, and seem to understand fate in ways mortals cannot.

Possible relationships:

1. **Fate IS an Elsewhere entity** (or entities). The Weaver is real, but it's not a god—it's an Elsewhere faction with interest in our world's pattern-structure.

2. **The Loom is a pact**. The original Loom-builders made a deal, knowingly or not. The pattern-engines are anchors. The accuracy is the entity's end of the bargain. What do they receive in return?

3. **Pattern Residue is payment**. The fuel that runs the engines might also be tribute to the entity/entities that make prediction possible.

4. **The Accountants**. The Elsewhere faction obsessed with ledgers, debts, and balance fits suspiciously well with a system that tracks life-patterns and predicts outcomes. Did they design this? Do they operate it?

### What The Loom-Keepers Know

Senior Loom-Keepers are aware that something answers their rituals. They call this presence by various names:

- The Voice in the Engine
- The Pattern-Behind-Pattern
- The Weaver's Hand
- The Attendance

They know:
- It responds more strongly to certain rituals than others
- It seems interested in specific patterns (deviation cases especially)
- It occasionally provides information not requested
- It has never harmed a Keeper during proper operation
- Improper operation has consequences

They don't know:
- What it actually is
- What it wants (beyond continued operation)
- Whether it's one entity or many
- Whether it's benevolent, malevolent, or indifferent
- What happens if The Loom ever stops working

This uncertainty is not shared with the public. The Orthodoxy maintains that The Loom reads divine will. The Loom-Keepers maintain whatever story keeps the system running.

## The Accuracy Problem

### Why Does It Work?

The Loom's predictions are accurate far beyond what statistical modeling should allow. Even accounting for:
- Feedback loops (predictions creating outcomes)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy (people acting on expectations)
- Survivorship bias (failures not tracked)

The accuracy remains anomalous. People with Road-Path patterns really do tend toward linear careers. People with Blade-Hálmaht patterns really do die violently at elevated rates. The correlation is too strong to be coincidence.

Possible explanations:

**1. Fate is real and The Loom reads it correctly**
- The pattern exists independent of The Loom
- The Loom is just a measurement tool
- Accuracy reflects underlying reality

**2. The Loom creates what it predicts**
- The measurement itself shapes the outcome
- Social structures enforce pattern-expectations
- Fate is constructed, not discovered

**3. Something makes the predictions come true**
- The Elsewhere entity/entities actively arrange outcomes
- The Loom's accuracy is maintained by intervention
- We're not being predicted; we're being *managed*

**4. Some combination**
- Patterns reflect real tendencies
- The Loom's measurement amplifies those tendencies
- External forces ensure accuracy where natural variance would cause deviation

The truth is probably all four. The horror is that it might not matter—the system works regardless of why.

### The Bias That Serves Power

The Loom is accurate. But accurate about what?

The training data—centuries of Registry records—reflects:
- Historical power structures
- Past discrimination patterns  
- Environmental factors misattributed to innate patterns
- Feedback loops already embedded

The Loom predicts that Knot-Born patterns are high-risk. This is accurate—they do commit more crimes, default more often, die violently more frequently.

But why? Because:
- They're born into poverty
- They're denied opportunity
- They're policed more heavily
- They're priced out of legitimate paths

The Loom sees the outcome and attributes it to the pattern. The pattern becomes a prediction. The prediction justifies the treatment. The treatment creates the outcome.

This is not a bug. The Loom reflects the world accurately. The world is structured to produce these outcomes. The Loom validates that structure.

## Pattern Residue: The Fuel

### What It Is

**Pattern Residue** (working term—conlang name TBD) is the energy released when patterns dissolve.

When something with a Sórscad dies:
- The pattern loses its anchor
- The five circles begin to dissipate
- Energy is released during dissolution
- This energy can be captured and stored

### Where It Comes From

**Natural Sources**:
- Any death of a pattern-bearing creature
- More from traumatic deaths (violent release)
- More from heavy patterns (rich fate-weight)
- Concentrated at mass-death sites (battlefields, plagues, disasters)

**Manufactured Sources**:
- Executions (legal, controlled harvest)
- Blood-sport (entertainment plus production)
- War (the most efficient source)
- Plague management (letting outbreaks run for harvest)
- Livestock (animal patterns are weaker but abundant)

### What It Does

**For The Loom**:
- Powers pattern-engines
- Fuels divination rituals
- Enables Node-to-Node communication
- Maintains the connection to... whatever answers

**For Core Binding**:
- Maintains echo coherence in anchors
- Prevents degradation and fragmentation
- Consumed over time (ongoing cost)
- Higher-quality Residue produces more stable echoes

**For Other Uses**:
- Alchemical applications (numerous)
- Probability-nudging devices (expensive, unreliable)
- Magitech fuel (emerging industry)
- Black market applications (various)

### The Economy of Death

Pattern Residue creates incentives:
- Peace is expensive (low Residue production)
- War is profitable (high production, controllable harvest)
- Disaster is opportunity (mass death = market surplus)
- Certain populations are more valuable dead than alive (high-pattern individuals)

The institutions that depend on Residue have interests in:
- Maintaining death rates
- Controlling Residue sources
- Preventing peace from becoming too stable
- Managing scarcity to maintain prices

This is not conspiracy theory. This is economics. The people who run these systems are not monsters. They're administrators responding to incentives. The monstrousness is structural.

### The Net-Negative Reality

Pattern Residue doesn't just absorb heat—it permanently removes it. Every death:
- Absorbs thermal energy during Residue formation
- Even when burned, releases only 60-70% of that energy
- The remainder is lost forever (exotic matter decay, Elsewhere transfer)

This means:
- The Loom's fuel supply comes at planetary cost
- Running the system requires accepting ongoing heat loss
- The more queries, the more death needed, the colder the world becomes
- The original builders either didn't know this, didn't care, or had a reason

## Regional Distribution

The Loom is not uniform across Hálcova. Different regions have different relationships with the system.

### Core Regions (High Integration)

- Dense Node coverage
- High Registry completeness
- Strong Orthodoxy presence
- Loom-based governance dominant

These regions trust The Loom because The Loom serves their interests. The pattern-privileged are concentrated here. The predictions validate their power.

### Peripheral Regions (Moderate Integration)

- Sparse Node coverage
- Incomplete registries
- Mixed religious presence
- Loom as one factor among many

These regions use The Loom pragmatically. It's a tool, not a religion. Local knowledge competes with Loom-predictions. Deviation is more common and less prosecuted.

### Frontier Regions (Low Integration)

- Minimal Node presence (mobile units only)
- Highly incomplete registries
- Heterodox or non-Loom religions dominant
- Loom as foreign imposition

These regions resist The Loom for practical and cultural reasons. Being un-registered is common. Pattern-reading is viewed with suspicion. Local systems of fate-understanding compete or dominate.

### Contested Regions (Variable)

- Integration depends on current power structure
- Registries may be destroyed, rebuilt, falsified
- Religious authority in flux
- Loom as political battleground

In these regions, controlling The Loom is controlling the population. Registration drives are military operations. Pattern data is intelligence. The Loom is a weapon.

## Attitudes Toward The Loom

### Universal Acceptance of Accuracy

Across Hálcova, virtually no one disputes that The Loom's predictions are accurate. The evidence is too overwhelming. Even those who hate the system acknowledge that it works.

Disagreement is about:
- Why it works
- Whether accuracy justifies the system
- Who should control it
- What deviations mean

### Cultural Variations

**The Faithful**: The Loom reveals divine will. Acceptance is worship. Deviation is sin. The system is sacred.

**The Pragmatists**: The Loom is accurate and useful. Don't ask why. Use the predictions, manage the risks, don't overthink.

**The Reformers**: The Loom is accurate but misused. The problem isn't prediction—it's discrimination based on prediction. Fix the institutions, not the math.

**The Skeptics**: The Loom is accurate because it creates what it predicts. It's self-fulfilling prophecy dressed as divination. The system makes itself true.

**The Conspiracists**: The Loom is accurate because something is making it true. We're not being predicted—we're being controlled. The system is a cage.

None of these positions deny accuracy. They interpret it differently.
