# Patterns and Bindings

---
**Story Reference:**
This section draws primarily from "The Reading" (01_the_reading_story_v3.md), with supporting details from "The Constrained" and "The Warden." The Binding ceremony, pattern fraud, and the Registry are central to Fèinnav’s arc, Àrnnav’s fate, and Vèscalìn’s investigation.

**Implications in the Stories:**
- Fèinnav’s Binding in "The Reading" exposes the gap between the metaphysical truth of the Attendance and the social reality of purchased patterns. Her family’s manipulation of the Szòvòtar and the Registry is a microcosm of systemic corruption.
- Àrnnav’s experience as pattern-constrained in "The Constrained" shows the lived consequences of a difficult pattern, and the social stratification that results.
- Vèscalìn’s discoveries in "The Warden" reveal the long-term effects of pattern fraud, both on individuals and the stability of the system itself.

## Overview

The pattern system is the metaphysical and social architecture that underpins Halcova’s society. Every citizen is subject to a Binding ceremony, where their pattern is revealed (or, in some cases, purchased or adjusted) and recorded in the Registry. Patterns shape fate, privilege, and constraint, determining the course of a person’s life.

## The Binding Ceremony

The Binding is a public ritual, conducted by a Szòvòtar, in which the Attendance is invoked to reveal the true pattern of the individual. The ceremony is both sacred and bureaucratic, blending ancient liturgy with the practicalities of record-keeping. Patterns are drawn from the Loom, interpreted, and inscribed in ink that is meant to be indelible.

### Pattern Types

**Story Reference:**
Pattern types and their consequences are dramatized in "The Reading" (Fèinnav and Àrnnav’s contrasting outcomes), "The Constrained" (Àrnnav’s Thorn/Maze pattern), and "The Warden" (Vèscalìn’s true pattern revealed as Thorn/Maze, not Tower-Watch).

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The distinction between privileged and constrained patterns is not just metaphysical but deeply social, affecting marriage, work, and even survival. The stories show how these categories are both enforced and subverted.

- **Pattern-Privileged**: Those whose patterns grant them social mobility, wealth, or influence (e.g., Ùtcai, Szèrrav, Coròncai).
- **Pattern-Constrained**: Those whose patterns are considered difficult, limiting, or unlucky (e.g., Tòvismaht, Vèszttar, Cèresztàhd).
- **Pattern-Pending**: Adolescents awaiting their Binding, or adults who have rejected the system and are thus outcast.

### Pattern Adjustment and Fraud

**Story Reference:**
Pattern fraud is a central plot in "The Reading" (the Còcalnòc family’s bribes), "Bleed" (echoes remembering the truth), and "The Warden" (systemic cover-up and investigation).

**Implications in the Stories:**
- The ability to purchase a pattern is a form of generational power. The exposure of this fraud is the catalyst for unrest and reform, as seen in the triptych and quintet stories.
