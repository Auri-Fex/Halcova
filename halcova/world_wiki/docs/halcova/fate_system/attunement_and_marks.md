# Attunement and Marks

---
**Story Reference:**
This section is informed by "The Warden" (Vèscalìn's attunement and marks), "Bleed" (attunement as risk), and "The Woven" (Loom operators). The costs and consequences of attunement are dramatized through the experiences of Wardens and Loom workers.

**Implications in the Stories:**
- Attunement is both a privilege and a burden, granting power but also exposing the bearer to danger and social stigma.

## Attunement

Attunement is the process by which certain individuals, such as Wardens and Loom operators, gain the ability to perceive patterns, violations, and metaphysical currents. This comes at a cost: Attunement marks appear around the eyes, and prolonged exposure can lead to bleed, memory loss, or psychological strain.

## Marks

Attunement marks are visible signs of metaphysical sensitivity. They are both a badge of office and a warning, marking the bearer as someone who has seen too much.

## Effects

- Enhanced perception of patterns and violations
- Susceptibility to bleed and pattern contamination
- Social stigma or reverence, depending on context
