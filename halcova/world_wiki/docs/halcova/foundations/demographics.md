<div class="halcova-header">Hálcova: Demographics and Population Economics</div>

## The Core Problem

The Residue economy creates a thermodynamic paradox:
- Every death absorbs ~100% of pattern-weight as thermal energy
- Burning that Residue only returns 60-70% of absorbed energy
- Net result: every death is a 30-40% thermal loss
- Yet civilization requires both death (for fuel) AND population (for labor, society, continuation)

How does any stable population exist?

## The Solution: The Thermal Budget

### The Math That Works

The key insight: **not all heat comes from Residue.**

**Heat Sources in Hálcova:**

| Source | Contribution | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Solar radiation (Sárgvas) | ~60% | Baseline heating, diminished by K-type star |
| Geothermal | ~15% | Critical in Vent Lands, minor elsewhere |
| Residue burning | ~20% | Civilization's contribution |
| Other (friction, metabolism, decay) | ~5% | Minor but real |

**The Critical Realization:**

Residue burning doesn't need to *replace* all heat lost to death. It only needs to:
1. Provide *localized* heating where people live
2. Supplement solar/geothermal in making settlements viable
3. Power magical and industrial processes that require concentrated energy

**The Equilibrium:**

- Hálcova's baseline temperature (without Residue effects) would be cold but not uninhabitable in temperate zones
- Residue absorption makes it *colder* than baseline
- Residue burning makes *specific locations* warmer than they'd otherwise be
- Net effect: the world is colder overall, but settlements are viable

## Population Figures

### Global Population

**Total Hálcovan Population: ~45-50 million**

This is roughly equivalent to medieval Europe at its peak—substantial but not enormous.

| Region | Population | Density | Notes |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| The Heartlands | 18-20 million | Moderate-high | Most developed, best farmland |
| Shattered Reaches | 8-10 million | Low-moderate | Maritime dispersal |
| Middle Waters | 4-5 million | High (on habitable islands) | Limited land area |
| Vent Lands | 6-7 million | Moderate | Concentrated in thermal valleys |
| Far Shelf | 3-4 million | Very low | Vast area, sparse settlement |
| Polar/Frontier | <500,000 | Minimal | Transient populations |

### Population Dynamics

**Birth Rate**: ~40-45 per 1,000 annually (high by modern standards, normal for pre-industrial)

**Death Rate**: ~35-40 per 1,000 annually (high, but population slowly growing)

**Net Growth**: ~0.5-1% annually

**Life Expectancy**:
- Pattern-privileged: 55-65 years
- Pattern-constrained: 35-45 years
- Practitioners (varies by Art): 30-50 years (shortened by practice)

### Why Population Is Sustainable

**The death rate doesn't need to be catastrophic:**

Annual deaths in Hálcova: ~1.5-2 million

This produces enough Residue to:
- Heat all settlements to habitable levels
- Power all Loom operations
- Fuel magical practices
- Run magitech industry

**The key is concentration:**
- Deaths happen everywhere
- Residue is *harvested and transported* to where it's needed
- Rural areas are colder; cities are warmer
- The Heartlands imports Residue from frontier regions

## The Residue Trade Flow

### Where Death Happens

**High Death Rate Regions:**
1. Frontier zones (harsh conditions, violence)
2. Mining settlements (dangerous work)
3. Military conflicts (war produces abundant Residue)
4. Urban slums (disease, violence, poverty)
5. Prisons and correction facilities (executions)

**Low Death Rate Regions:**
1. Pattern-privileged urban cores
2. Middle Waters (best conditions)
3. Established agricultural zones
4. Protected religious communities

### Where Residue Goes

**The Flow:**

```
Death Sites → Harvesters → Refineries → Distribution → End Users
    ↓              ↓            ↓            ↓            ↓
 Frontier      Licensed     Regional      Trade       Cities,
  zones,       guilds,      processing   networks,    Loom Nodes,
 prisons,      illegal       hubs        smuggling   industry,
battlefields  operators                              practitioners
```

**Major Trade Routes:**

- Far Shelf → Heartlands (raw Residue for processing)
- Frontier mines → Regional cities (industrial fuel)
- Shattered Reaches → Middle Waters (maritime trade)
- Vent Lands → Everywhere (refined/processed Residue, premium prices)

### The Economic Structure

**Residue Pricing** (in marks):

| Grade | Price per unit | Primary use |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Raw/Crude | 1-5 | Basic heating, bulk fuel |
| Refined | 10-25 | Quality heating, general magic |
| Concentrated | 50-100 | Loom operations, serious magic |
| Pattern-Specific | 100-500 | Specialized applications |
| Pact-Grade | 500+ | Entity dealings, rare uses |

**Annual Residue Economy**: ~5-10 million marks total value
(Comparable to the entire agricultural sector)

## Animal Residue: The Hidden Economy

### The Critical Supplement

Human deaths alone couldn't sustain civilization. Animal Residue fills the gap.

**Animal Pattern Weight:**

| Creature | Pattern Weight (vs. human) | Residue Quality |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Insects | Negligible | Unusable |
| Small game | 5-10% | Low grade |
| Livestock (standard) | 15-25% | Usable |
| Draft animals | 30-40% | Good quality |
| Large predators | 40-60% | High quality |
| Leviathans | 200-500% | Premium |

**The Livestock Solution:**

Most heating Residue comes from animals, not humans:
- Slaughterhouses are Residue production facilities
- Herding cultures produce both food AND fuel
- Fishing/whaling provides marine Residue
- "Meat" is almost a byproduct of Residue production

**Human Residue Is Premium:**

Human Residue is:
- Higher quality (more pattern-weight)
- Required for certain magical operations
- Necessary for Loom fuel (animal Residue works poorly)
- Culturally significant (death rites)

But the *bulk* heating comes from animals.

### Annual Residue Budget

**Estimated Annual Residue Production:**

| Source | Deaths/Year | Residue Units | % of Total |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Livestock slaughter | ~20 million | ~4 million | 45% |
| Natural human deaths | ~1.5 million | ~1.5 million | 17% |
| Wild animal hunting | ~5 million | ~1 million | 11% |
| Marine harvesting | ~2 million | ~800,000 | 9% |
| Executions/Corrections | ~50,000 | ~75,000 | 1% |
| War casualties | Variable | Variable | 5-15% |
| Other (disease, accident) | ~500,000 | ~500,000 | 6% |

**Total**: ~8-9 million Residue units annually

## Population Control Mechanisms

### Pattern-Based Reproduction

The Loom affects reproduction:

**Marriage Authorization**:
- Orthodox regions require pattern-compatibility readings
- Incompatible patterns face social/legal barriers
- Pattern-privileged encouraged to marry within class
- Pattern-constrained discouraged from reproduction (though not prevented)

**Pattern Inheritance**:

Patterns aren't strictly inherited, but:
- Children of pattern-privileged tend toward privilege (~70%)
- Children of pattern-constrained tend toward constraint (~70%)
- District effects (where you're born affects draw)
- Lineage effects (family history influences probability)

### Death Management

Society manages death rates through:

**Encouraged Death**:
- Capital punishment (efficient Residue production)
- Dangerous labor assignments for pattern-constrained
- "Voluntary" military service
- Pact-substitution systems

**Discouraged Death**:
- Pattern-privileged protected by law and resources
- Skilled workers preserved (economic value)
- Reproductive-age population somewhat protected
- Children generally protected (incomplete patterns = weak Residue)

### Immigration and Migration

**Internal Migration**:
- Pattern-constrained pushed toward frontiers
- Pattern-privileged concentrate in core regions
- Practitioners migrate toward tolerant regions
- Economic migrants follow Residue trade

**The Population Pressure Valve**:
- Far Shelf absorbs "surplus" population
- Frontier expansion continues
- War casualties prevent overpopulation
- Plague/disease periodically reduces population

## Demographic Implications

### The Stable Horror

The population is *sustainable*. That's part of the horror.

- The system isn't collapsing
- Death rates are manageable
- Birth rates replace losses
- The economy functions

This isn't a world on the edge of extinction. It's a world that has *optimized* for death production while maintaining population. The machine works.

### Class Reproduction

Pattern-based society reproduces itself:

- Privileged families maintain privilege
- Constrained families remain constrained
- The system self-perpetuates
- Mobility exists but is rare

### The Growth Question

If population grows:
- More death = more Residue
- More people = more consumption
- Equilibrium maintained... until it isn't

**Future Pressures**:
- What happens if population doubles?
- What happens if a plague kills half?
- What happens if war casualties spike?

The system is stable but not infinitely elastic. Major disruptions could cascade.

---

## Summary

The population paradox resolves through:

1. **Mixed heat sources**: Residue isn't the only heat; solar and geothermal provide baseline
2. **Animal Residue**: Most heating comes from livestock, not humans
3. **Concentration**: Residue flows from death-sites to settlements
4. **Premium human Residue**: Human death provides high-quality fuel for magic/Loom
5. **Sustainable death rates**: ~35-40 per 1,000 is high but not catastrophic
6. **Population management**: Pattern system shapes reproduction and death distribution

The math works. The economy functions. The horror is that it works *well enough to continue indefinitely*.
