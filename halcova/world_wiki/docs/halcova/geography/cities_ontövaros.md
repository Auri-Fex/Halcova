# Öntőváros: The Guild Metropolis

## Overview

**Öntőváros** (UN-tuh-vah-rohsh, "Foundry City") is the largest city in the Vent Lands and the industrial heart of Hálcova, with a population of approximately 180,000. Unlike Fonváros, where the Crown rules and the Concordat reads fate, Öntőváros is governed by the **Guild Congress**—an assembly of trade associations that has maintained effective independence from royal authority for three centuries.

The city's name comes from its founding industry: the great bronze and iron foundries that still dominate the riverside. But Öntőváros has grown far beyond metalwork. Every major craft guild maintains headquarters here, and the city produces everything from precision instruments to homunculi to ships.

This is where things are *made*. And the people who make things have decided they should rule themselves.

## Geography and Layout

### Location

Öntőváros occupies both banks of the **Tűzfolyó** (TOOZ-foh-yoh, "Fire River"), named for the way foundry slag once made the water glow at night. The river provides:
- Hydropower for workshops and manufactories
- Transportation for raw materials and finished goods
- Cooling water for industrial processes
- A natural division between old and new city

The surrounding landscape is scarred by centuries of extraction—quarries, mines, clay pits, and timber operations radiate outward from the city.

### The Five Quarters

Unlike Fonváros's organic districts, Öntőváros was deliberately planned around guild functions.
