# Szigetköz: The Harbor of Chains

## Overview

**Szigetköz** (SEE-get-kuhz, "Island-Crossing") is the largest settlement in the Shattered Reaches and the closest thing the island confederacy has to a capital, with a population of approximately 95,000. Built across seven islands connected by bridges, causeways, and ferry lines, the city serves as the central meeting point for the Reaches' notoriously independent captains and island lords.

Unlike Fonváros's centralized authority or Öntőváros's guild structure, Szigetköz operates on **negotiated chaos**—a constantly shifting web of alliances, debts, and agreements that somehow produces functional governance. The saying goes: "In Szigetköz, everything is for sale, including the people selling things."

The city's epithet, "Harbor of Chains," refers not to slavery (though that history exists) but to the chains of obligation, debt, and alliance that bind everyone to everyone else. No one stands alone here. No one is truly free. But everyone has leverage.

## Geography and Layout

### The Seven Islands

Szigetköz occupies an archipelago where warm and cold currents meet, creating fog, rich fishing, and unpredictable weather. The seven islands are connected but distinct:

#### 1. Kapitánysziget (Captain's Island)
**Size**: Largest island, central position
**Character**: Political and ceremonial heart

**Key Features**:
- **The Moot Hall** (Gyűlésterem): Where the Captain's Council meets
- **The Chain House** (Láncház): Where debts and alliances are registered
- **Harbor Master's Tower**: Controls all harbor access
- **The Old Fortress**: Ancient, now ceremonial, houses the Reaches Archive
- **Captain's Row**: Mansions of the wealthiest ship-owners

**Population**: ~18,000
**Dominant Interest**: Ship captains and major traders
**Notable**: Neutral ground by ancient compact; violence here triggers collective retaliation

#### 2. Kereskedősziget (Merchant's Island)
**Size**: Second largest, eastern position
**Character**: Commerce and warehousing

**Key Features**:
- **The Great Wharf**: Largest docking facility in the Reaches
- **Warehouse District**: Massive storage facilities
