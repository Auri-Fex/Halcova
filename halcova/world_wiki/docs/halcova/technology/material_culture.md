# Technology and Material Culture

## Overview

Hálcova operates at a late medieval to early Renaissance technological level, modified by the unique presence of Pattern Residue as an energy source and the Five Arts as supplements to mechanical innovation. Some technologies are more advanced than Earth equivalents; others lag behind or were never developed.

## The Baseline: What Exists

### Metallurgy

**Iron and Steel**:
- High-quality steel production, especially in the Vent Lands (geothermal forging)
- Pattern-engines require precision metalwork
- Armor and weapons comparable to 15th century Earth
- Specialty alloys for Residue containment

**Precious Metals**:
- Gold, silver, copper standard
- Electrum used in pattern-engine components
- Unknown metals in ancient ruins (cannot be replicated)

**What's Missing**:
- No aluminum (requires electrolysis)
- No industrial-scale production

### Construction

**Stone and Timber**:
- Advanced masonry (cathedrals, fortifications)
- Sophisticated timber framing
- Understanding of arches, domes, buttresses
- Multi-story construction common in cities

**Residue-Assisted**:
- Heated buildings using Residue burning
- Pattern-engines in major structures
- Some ancient structures use unknown construction methods
