Overview The Loom is the distributed network of devices, rituals, and institutions that read, record, and predict fate in H\u00e1lcova. It is not a single machine but a system\u2014part arcane technology, part religious practice, part bureaucratic apparatus. More importantly: The Loom may be a point of contact with Fate itself. Whether Fate is an Elsewhere entity, a collection of entities, or something stranger is a matter of fierce theological debate. What's undeniable is that The Loom works . Its predictions are accurate far beyond statistical chance. And something answers when the Loom-Keepers perform their divinations. What The Loom Is The Physical Infrastructure Loom-Nodes Distributed across H\u00e1lcova, Loom-Nodes are the physical anchors of the system: Major Nodes : Large installations in capital cities and religious centers. Cathedral-sized complexes housing pattern-engines, archives, and ritual spaces. Staffed by hundreds of Loom-Keepers. Minor Nodes : Town-level facilities. Smaller pattern-engines, local registries, drawing chambers. Staffed by licensed practitioners and temple appointees. Mobile Nodes : Portable equipment for frontier regions, military operations, and emergency readings. Less accurate but functional. Private Nodes : Illegal or gray-market installations operated by wealthy individuals, corporations, and criminal organizations. Quality varies wildly. The Pattern-Engines At the heart of each Node is a pattern-engine\u2014a device that: Records S\u00f3rscad data from drawings Performs predictive calculations Communicates with other Nodes (major ones only) Interfaces with... something. The source of The Loom's impossible accuracy. Pattern-engines are part clockwork, part alchemical apparatus, part something that defies categorization. Their construction is a closely guarded secret. Their fuel is Pattern Residue\u2014the same substance that maintains echo anchors. The Institutional Structure The Loom-Keepers A guild-priesthood that operates The Loom. They are: Trained in pattern-reading, engine operation, and ritual practice Licensed by both religious and civil authorities Bound by oaths that constrain their use of Loom-knowledge Organized hierarchically from apprentices to High Weavers Loom-Keepers occupy an ambiguous social position. They're essential to Governance , commerce, and religion. They're also viewed with suspicion\u2014people who know too much about everyone else's fate. The Registry The accumulated database of all S\u00f3rscad patterns ever drawn. Stored in: Physical archives (paper, metal plates, encoded materials) Pattern-engine memory (poorly understood how this works) Distributed across major Nodes with varying levels of completeness The Registry is legally protected, politically contested, and practically impossible to fully secure. Pattern-theft, registry-manipulation, and archive-raids are all documented crimes. Calculation Houses Institutions using Loom data: actuarial houses, credit temples, merchant guilds , legal colleges, military orders. License Loom access for insurance, lending, employment, sentencing, recruitment. What The Loom Does Pattern recording: S\u00f3rscad drawn via ritual, captured, recorded, indexed, transmitted. Prediction: life-arc probabilities, decision tendencies, risk profiles, compatibility assessments. Deviation detection: minor, significant, anomalous\u2014can indicate error, environment, manipulation, or theologically troubling events. The Source: Fate as Entity Orthodox: Loom reads the Weaver's will. Heterodox: Loom's accuracy may come from Elsewhere entities, pacts, or Pattern Residue as payment. Loom-Keepers know something answers rituals but don't know what it is. The Accuracy Problem Why does it work? Fate is real, Loom reads it; Loom creates what it predicts; Elsewhere entities arrange outcomes; combination. Bias: Loom reflects historical power structures, discrimination, feedback loops. Pattern Residue: The Fuel Energy released when patterns dissolve at death. Natural sources: any death, more from trauma/heavy patterns. Manufactured: executions, blood-sport, war, plague, livestock. Used for Loom, core binding, alchemy, magitech. Economy: peace is expensive, war is profitable, disaster is opportunity. Regional Distribution Core regions: dense Loom coverage, strong Orthodoxy, pattern-privileged. Peripheral: sparse coverage, mixed religion, deviation common. Frontier: minimal Loom, heterodox, unregistered. Contested: Loom is political battleground. Attitudes Toward The Loom Universal acceptance of accuracy; disagreement about why.

The Fundamental Problem Every political philosophy on Earth assumes a baseline: people are created equal, or they aren't, but either way you can't prove it by reading their metaphysical signature at birth. H\u00e1lcova doesn't have that luxury. The S\u00f3rscad exists. It's readable. It predicts outcomes with uncomfortable accuracy. This breaks political philosophy at its foundations and forces reconstruction from first principles. The Questions That Matter What Does \"Equality\" Mean? On Earth : Equality typically means equal moral worth, equal rights, equal standing before the law\u2014regardless of observable differences in capability or circumstance. On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support. Consent On H\u00e1lcova, the Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. Consent is complicated by prediction, manipulation, and pattern constraints. Positions: experienced, structural, predictive, skepticism. Legitimacy Authority may be legitimized by pattern, Loom-sanction, prediction, or pragmatic success.

Legal Frameworks Intent and prediction: pattern-predictive policing, pattern-blind law, pattern-weighted sentencing, pattern as mitigating factor. Actual legal variation by region. Criminal justice intersects with residue production; execution rates and residue demand are linked. Property and Pattern Inheritance, contracts, innovation, and property rights are shaped by pattern. Positions: libertarian, distributive, communitarian, skeptic. Inter-Regional Politics Trade web: residue, food, labor flows.

Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects. The five magical traditions\u2014collectively called the Five Arts\u2014each represent a different answer to the question: What are you willing to pay?

Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late. Category One: Core Binding The Art of Holding the Dead Fundamental Principle When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental. The core is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned. Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't. That's the relationship. The Core Explore Related Topics World Summary Metaphysics Fate System Society Governance Planetary Conlang What It Is The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. See Metaphysics . Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: Violent deaths Deaths with unfinished purpose Deaths accompanied by intense emotion Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: Peaceful passings Deaths accepted and prepared for Lives that felt complete Core Binding (Echo Binding) Anchors: Physical objects housing bound echoes\u2014figurines, tiles, metal plates, bone carvings, jewelry. The anchor must depict the bound echo, either by natural manifestation or artistic creation. Binders carry as many anchors as they can transport; activation summons echoes, but too many cause resonance interference and physical drain. Upkeep: Echoes require a consumable resource to remain coherent. Resource economy includes harvesters, refiners, merchants, smugglers, and black markets. See Society . Consumption rates vary by echo complexity and awareness. Quality matters\u2014adulterated, counterfeited, aged, or fresh. Decay: Echo bleed causes phantom sensations, behavioral drift, and memory intrusion. Awareness accelerates decay. Old binders become patchworks of their echoes. Release: Possible but rare\u2014money, spite, revenge, nostalgia, love, exhaustion. Most binders hold on long past reason. Opposition: Family, religious/philosophical groups, former binders, governments. The living object; the echoes don't know they're dead. Economy: Cores are commodities. Poachers, assassins, scavengers, harvesters, brokers, appraisers, storage facilities. Wars produce inventory. Anomalies: Extracting a core from the living creates disturbing, unstable anomalies. Terminology: Conlang terms forthcoming. Current terms: core, binding, echo, anchor, binder, resource, bleed. Category Two: Flesh Shaping The Art of Constructing Life Fundamental Principle Life is raw potential, waiting for the right conditions to be realized. Flesh Shaping is the art of taking this potential and giving it form. By sacrificing your own blood and meat, you can shape and animate matter, creating homunculi\u2014servants that carry out your will. The Horror Each homunculus is a patchwork of materials, held together by your blood and will. They are not alive in the traditional sense; they do not grow, reproduce, or truly think. They are reflections of your own body and mind, distorted and incomplete. The Process Materials Homunculi can be made from any combination of materials: flesh, bone, clay, metal, wax, leather. The more complex the desired homunculus, the more materials and blood are required. The Spark The spark of life is your own blood, infused with your will and intent. It is what animates the homunculus, giving it the semblance of life. Without this spark, the materials remain inert, mere shapes without purpose or direction. Tethering and Conjuring Once the homunculus is formed, it must be tethered to you, its creator. This tether is a lifeline, linking the homunculus to your own life force. As long as the tether remains intact, the homunculus will obey your commands and act as your servant. However, the tether is also a vulnerability. If the homunculus is destroyed, the shock can bleed into you, causing physical and spiritual harm. Moreover, the more homunculi you have active, the weaker each tether becomes, and the greater the strain on your own body and mind.

The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning): When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks. The Principle : Pact Summoning allows you to substitute others' souls for your own in paying entity costs. This creates classic moral hazard: You get the power without the personal cost Others pay the price, often without their consent Incentives for caution or restraint are externalized How It Manifests : Entities design pacts to encourage substitution, feeding on more souls. Society creates markets for \"willing\" substitutes, insurance pools, and political systems that externalize pact costs onto underclasses. The system optimizes for maximum soul consumption. The Horror : The more powerful the binder, the greater the temptation to exploit this moral hazard. Entire communities can be sacrificed for the ambitions of a few.

What works in the Heartlands\u2014where Loom coverage is total and Orthodox faith dominant\u2014fails spectacularly in the Far Shelf. What works in the Vent Lands' guild structure makes no sense in the Shattered Reaches' maritime fragmentation. This document describes how each region actually governs, not just what principles they claim. The Heartlands: Orthodox Theocratic Monarchy The Official Structure The Crown : Hereditary monarchy, pattern-validated. The ruling family's pattern includes \"governance fate.\" Succession is technically by birth order, practically by pattern-suitability reading. Unsuitable heirs can be passed over \"for the good of the pattern.\" The Church : The Orthodox Church of the Weaver operates as parallel government. The High Primate is theoretically subordinate to the Crown but controls the Loom apparatus, which makes the relationship... complicated. The Council of Threads : Advisory body of major noble houses, high clergy, Warden Order representation, and selected merchant interests. Formally advisory; practically constrains royal action. The Warden Order : Enforcement arm with legal authority parallel to secular courts. Reports to Church hierarchy but operates with significant autonomy. The Actual Power Distribution The Crown controls: military force, taxation, secular appointments, foreign policy (officially), and emergency powers. The Church controls: Loom access, pattern certification, deviation prosecution, education (largely), marriage authorization, and theological legitimacy. The Noble Houses control: local governance in their territories, military levies, resource extraction, and trade relationships. The Warden Order controls: information about deviation, pattern-crime prosecution, inter-house disputes involving pattern, and a monopoly on violence that the secular military can't match for precision. How Decisions Actually Get Made Routine matters : Bureaucracy. A vast apparatus of pattern-certified clerks processing applications, resolving disputes, allocating resources. The machine runs itself. Policy matters : Negotiation between Crown, Church, and major houses. No one party can impose on the others. Coalitions form around specific issues. The appearance of unity matters enormously. Pattern matters : The Church. If it involves deviation, Loom interpretation, or theological legitimacy, secular authorities formally defer. In practice, secular authorities negotiate quietly. Crisis matters : Whoever acts first. The formal process is too slow. Crises are resolved by whoever has force available and will to use it. Legitimacy is constructed afterward. The Succession Question The Heartlands' great vulnerability is succession. The pattern-reading system creates uncertainty: The Crown Prince's pattern might indicate unsuitability A younger sibling might have a stronger \"governance fate\" Readings can be manipulated (or accused of manipulation) The Church controls the reading process Every succession is a potential crisis. Houses position for influence over the next ruler. The Church leverages its reading authority. The current system survives because everyone fears the alternative more than they resent the current arrangement. The Shattered Reaches: Fragmented Maritime Polities The Overall Structure No unified government. Instead: City-States : Major port cities govern themselves and hinterlands. Varying internal structures\u2014some hereditary lords, some elected councils, some merchant oligarchies. Island Kingdoms : Larger islands or island chains under single rulers. Range from absolute monarchies to constitutional systems with strong assemblies. Merchant Leagues : Transnational organizations of trading houses. Not governments technically, but exercise governmental functions\u2014currency, contract enforcement, dispute resolution. Free Ports : Cities that claim no sovereign, governed by whatever coalition currently maintains order. Frequently chaotic. Common Elements Despite fragmentation, most Reaches polities share: Assembly Traditions : Some body represents major interests\u2014landholders, merchants, guilds, sometimes broader citizenship. Even autocrats convene assemblies for legitimacy. Contract Primacy : Written agreements are sacred. Enforcement varies but the principle is consistent. Maritime Law : Shared traditions governing ships, ports, sea commerce. Recognizable across polities even when local law diverges. Pattern Skepticism : Official rejection of pattern-determinism, even while pattern information circulates privately. The League System Merchant Leagues provide coherence the political system lacks: The Amber League : Residue trade. Controls major refinement facilities. Can embargo polities that misbehave. The Salt League : Fishing and sea-hunting. Controls most protein production. Seasonal workers depend on League contracts. The Iron League : Metals and manufacturing. Dominates Reaches industrial capacity. The Counting League : Banking and insurance. Enforces debts across jurisdictions. These Leagues: - Negotiate with each other as quasi-states - Maintain private arbitration systems - Control key infrastructure - Cross-cut political boundaries - Provide stability the political system doesn't Decision-Making Within polities : Varies by polity. Hereditary rulers, elected councils, oligarchic boards. Most involve negotiation between major interests. Between polities : Treaties, trade agreements, temporary alliances. No permanent inter-polity structure. The Leagues provide coordination when needed. Region-wide : Rarely achieved. Existential threats (Heartlands aggression, major piracy) might produce temporary confederation. Otherwise, each polity acts independently. The Middle Waters: Colonial Administration and Contested Authority The Patchwork The Middle Waters is not a unified region. It's a collection of: Heartlands Colonies : Directly administered from the Heartlands. Governors appointed, pattern-certified. Orthodox church presence. Warden authority recognized. Reaches Trading Posts : Commercial enclaves under League authority. Focused on trade, not governance. Minimal administration beyond what commerce requires. Vent Lands Footholds : Guild-operated facilities. Primarily geothermal research and colony cultivation. Governed by guild protocols. Native Polities : Indigenous governance systems that predate colonial contact. Various structures\u2014island monarchies, council systems, Colony Cult theocracies. Surviving in territories colonizers haven't taken. Contested Zones : Areas where multiple powers claim authority. Practical governance by whoever has force present. Colonial Administration Heartlands colonies follow a template: Governor : Appointed from Heartlands, pattern-certified for colonial service. Extensive authority within colony. Reports to colonial ministry in the capital. Colonial Council : Local merchants, settlers, sometimes native representatives. Advisory formally; practically shapes policy because Governor needs local cooperation. Orthodox Mission : Church presence. Conversion efforts. Loom access for colonists. Pattern-reading services. Warden Contingent : Pattern-crime enforcement. Often understaffed for territory covered. Military Garrison : Varies by colony importance. Some heavily defended; some token presence. Native Governance Pre-contact polities that survive: Island Kingdoms : Traditional hereditary rule, sometimes modified by colonial contact. May acknowledge colonial overlordship nominally while operating independently practically. Colony Cult Councils : Governance through the oldest, most-integrated hosts. The colony itself participates in decisions (or is perceived to). Disturbing to outsiders; functional for members. Elder Assemblies : Collective governance by age-ranked community members. Pattern-skeptical traditions. Resistant to Loom integration. The Power Dynamics Heartlands wants: resources (tropical agriculture, rare materials), strategic position (naval bases), and Loom extension (integration of native populations into pattern-tracking). Reaches want: trade access, competitive position against Heartlands, resource extraction without administrative burden. Vent Lands want: specific research sites, colony cultivation environments, and deniable experimentation space. Native populations want: survival, autonomy, and to play powers against each other. The result is constant maneuvering, shifting alliances, and no stable governance framework. The Vent Lands: Guild Federation The Guild Structure The Primary Guilds (control critical infrastructure): Thermal Engineers Guild : Maintains geothermal systems that make habitation possible. Without them, the heat stops. Ultimate veto on anything. Sulfur Extractors Guild : Controls toxic zone operations. Essential for industrial inputs. Flesh Shapers Consortium : Actually several competing guilds united for external negotiation. Controls homunculi production, medical services, and flesh-shaping expertise. Makers Guild : Manufacturing, crafting, non-flesh construction. Largest membership. Merchants Assembly : Trade and commerce. Not technically a guild; effectively operates as one. The Secondary Guilds : Dozens of specialized trades. Less political power but economically important. The Council System The High Council : Representatives of primary guilds. Makes region-wide decisions. Operates by consensus mostly; votes when necessary, weighted by guild importance (which is constantly contested). Valley Councils : Local governance for specific thermal valleys. Primary guilds represented; secondary guilds have voice. Handle local disputes, resource allocation, emergency response. Inter-Guild Courts : Dispute resolution between guilds or between guild members and non-members. Judges selected from neutral guilds. Precedent-based, expertise-weighted. Decision-Making Technical decisions : Made by relevant guild. If the Thermal Engineers say a system is unsafe, it's unsafe. If Flesh Shapers say a procedure is untested, it's untested. Expertise commands deference. Resource allocation : Negotiated in councils. Guilds trade access for access. \"We'll route more heat to your valley if you prioritize our metal orders.\" External relations : High Council speaks for the region. Individual guilds can pursue external relationships within guidelines. Emergencies : Rapid guild coordination through standing protocols. Volcanic events, toxic spills, and major accidents trigger automatic responses without political debate. Non-Guild Population Not everyone is guild member. Non-members: - Can work for guilds as employees (not members) - Have limited legal standing in guild courts - Can form associations for mutual aid - Cannot access guild-controlled resources directly - Depend on guild good behavior for survival This creates a two-tier system. Guild members have rights and power. Non-members have what members grant them. The Vent Lands' Advantage The guild system works because: - Everyone depends on infrastructure - Expertise is genuinely necessary and scarce - Geographic constraints force cooperation - External threats (volcanoes, toxins, ice) override internal conflicts - The system produces results (heat, safety, prosperity) It's not democratic. It's not equal. But it's stable and functional. The Far Shelf: Decentralized Autonomy The Non-Structure The Far Shelf resists unified governance by design. What exists: Community Assemblies : Each settlement governs itself. Size varies from family groups to substantial towns. Decisions made by consensus, voting, or charismatic authority depending on local tradition. Regional Councils : Occasional gatherings of community representatives. No permanent structure. Convened for specific issues, dissolves when issue resolved. Defense Coordination : The one function requiring regional cooperation. Loose agreements about mutual aid, warning systems, and resistance to external incursion. Trade Networks : Informal relationships between communities. No League-style organization. Trust-based, family-based, history-based. Variation in Local Governance Consensus Communities : Decisions require agreement of all adults. Time-consuming but cohesive. Common in smaller settlements. Council Communities : Elected or selected representatives make decisions. Larger settlements need this efficiency. Elder Dominance : Oldest members have authority. Traditional form, declining but persistent. Strong Chief : Individual leader with broad authority. Usually emerges in crisis, sometimes persists. Hybrid Forms : Consensus on major issues, delegation on minor. Elections for some positions, inheritance for others. Whatever the community has evolved. How Regional Action Happens When the Far Shelf acts as a region (rare): Someone calls a gathering : A community facing a problem invites others. There's no standing authority to convene. Communities send representatives : Or don't. Attendance is voluntary. Debate occurs : No rules of order necessarily. Charismatic speakers, respected elders, and holders of relevant information shape the conversation. Consensus emerges (or doesn't) : If enough communities agree, they act together. If not, they don't. Action is voluntary : Each community implements (or doesn't) according to their own decision. This sounds unworkable. It often is. But it's also resistant to capture\u2014no one can seize central authority because there isn't any. Resistance Identity Far Shelf politics is defined by opposition to: Heartlands imperialism Loom surveillance Pattern-determinism Orthodox theology Centralized authority This resistance is the closest thing to regional ideology. Communities that disagree about everything else agree they don't want to become the Heartlands. The Weaknesses Coordination failure : Collective action problems are real. Communities that need to cooperate often can't. External exploitation : Powerful external actors (Heartlands traders, Reaches merchants) can exploit disunity. Internal conflict : Without central authority, inter-community disputes can escalate. Resource scarcity : The Far Shelf is poor. Governance can't solve resource constraints. Governance Comparison Dimension Heartlands Shattered Reaches Middle Waters Vent Lands Far Shelf Unity Unified (one crown, one church) Fragmented (many polities) Colonial patchwork Guild federation Radically decentralized Legitimacy Basis Divine pattern-mandate Consent and contract Power projection Expertise and necessity Community autonomy Decision Mode Negotiation among elites Varies by polity; league coordination Imposed by strongest Guild consensus Local consensus Pattern Role Central (certification required) Marginal (officially) Varies by controller Secondary to expertise Rejected Warden Status Full authority Treaty-limited Colonial presence Guild-negotiated Illegal Stability Stable until succession Stable within polities; regional chaos Unstable, contested Very stable Chaotic but resilient Inter-Regional Governance No World Government There is no global authority. The closest approximations: The Orthodox Church : Claims universal spiritual authority. Recognized only in Heartlands and colonies. Others reject the claim. The Warden Order : Claims jurisdiction over pattern-crimes everywhere. Practically limited to where they can operate. The Merchant Leagues : Cross-border economic coordination. No political pretensions, but economic leverage creates influence. The Loom Network : Nodes in every region connect to the same system. The Attendance doesn't recognize borders. But control of nodes is fragmented. Treaty Relationships Heartlands-Reaches : Complex web of bilateral treaties. Trade agreements, extradition provisions, Warden access rights. Renegotiated constantly. Heartlands-Vent Lands : Trade treaties. Guild limitations on Warden operations. Mutual recognition of contracts. Heartlands-Far Shelf : No formal treaties. The Heartlands doesn't recognize Far Shelf sovereignty; the Far Shelf doesn't acknowledge Heartlands authority. Reaches-Vent Lands : Commercial treaties through the Leagues. Guild-League mutual recognition. Everyone-Middle Waters : The Middle Waters isn't party to treaties\u2014it's the subject. External powers make agreements about the Middle Waters, not with it. Conflict Resolution Between Heartlands and Reaches : Occasional naval skirmishes, trade wars, proxy conflicts. No full-scale war in generations (too costly for both). Between Heartlands and Far Shelf : Persistent low-level conflict. Heartlands claims authority; Far Shelf resists. Neither commits to decisive action. Between Reaches polities : Frequent. Piracy, trade disputes, territorial claims. Usually limited in scope. The Leagues sometimes mediate. In Middle Waters : Constant maneuvering, occasional violence, no resolution. The colonial powers prefer frozen conflict to resolution that might advantage rivals. Summary: The Governance Landscape H\u00e1lcova has no unified political order. Five regions with five different systems interact through trade, conflict, and limited treaty. The Loom connects them metaphysically; nothing connects them politically. This fragmentation is stable because: - No power can dominate all others - Geography and climate limit force projection - The Residue economy creates interdependence without requiring integration - Everyone fears what a true hegemon might do with the Loom The instability lies in: - Succession crises in the Heartlands - Colonial competition in the Middle Waters - Coordination failures in the Far Shelf - Guild tensions in the Vent Lands - Everything in the Shattered Reaches The system persists not because it works well, but because alternatives are worse\u2014or because pattern predicts it will persist. Which amounts to the same thing.

The existence of readable fate, predictable behavior, and measurable destiny forces every legal system to answer questions Earth jurisprudence never faced: Can you punish inevitability? Can you contract against destiny? Is deviation a crime or a miracle? Different regions answer differently. All answers cost something. The Taxonomy of Pattern-Crimes Deviation Definition : Acting against your pattern's predictions. The Problem : If patterns are divine (Orthodox view) or physically real (materialist view), deviation is either sin or impossibility. Yet it happens. Some people act against prediction. Orthodox Position : Deviation is heresy. The pattern is The Weaver's will; defying it defies divine order. Punishment is spiritual correction as much as temporal. Skeptic Position : Deviation proves patterns are probabilistic, not deterministic. \"Deviants\" are just statistical outliers. Criminalizing deviation criminalizes being unpredicted. Actual Practice : Heartlands criminalizes deviation. Shattered Reaches doesn't (officially). Other regions vary. The Warden Order prosecutes deviation everywhere it can reach, creating jurisdictional conflicts. Pattern Fraud Definition : Misrepresenting your pattern to gain advantage. Subtypes : Identity Fraud : Claiming to be someone with a different pattern. Using someone else's pattern-documentation. Reading Fraud : Providing false pattern-readings. Bribing Loom-readers. Using counterfeit pattern-engines. Prediction Fraud : Claiming false predictions to manipulate others. \"The Loom says you'll fail unless you pay me.\" Suppression Fraud : Hiding your pattern when legally required to disclose. Employment fraud. Marriage fraud. Contract fraud. Why It Matters : Pattern information has economic value. The entire credit, insurance, and employment system rests on pattern accuracy. Fraud attacks the foundation. Enforcement : Heavy everywhere. Even the Far Shelf, which hates pattern-tracking, punishes fraudulent misrepresentation. The crime isn't having a pattern\u2014it's lying about it. Pattern Evasion Definition : Avoiding pattern-reading or removing yourself from the Loom's tracking. The Gray Area : Is it illegal to simply... leave? To go where the Loom doesn't reach? To refuse readings? Orthodox Position : Evasion is proto-deviation. Why avoid the Loom unless you plan to deviate? Evasion is suspicious and warrants investigation. Autonomist Position : You own your pattern. Refusing to share it is your right. Mandatory reading is slavery. Actual Practice : The Heartlands requires pattern documentation for most activities. No reading, no employment, no housing, no trade. Evasion isn't explicitly illegal\u2014you just can't participate in society. The Far Shelf explicitly protects pattern-privacy. Forced reading is assault. Other regions fall between. Pattern Interference Definition : Manipulating someone else's pattern without consent. Theoretical Nature : May not be possible. May be mythical. The uncertainty is part of the legal problem. Legal Treatment : Illegal everywhere\u2014in theory. But if it's impossible, the laws are purely symbolic. If it's possible and secret, the laws are unenforceable. The Warden Order maintains that interference is real and they've prosecuted it. Skeptics note that \"interference\" explains away prediction failures conveniently. The Burden of Proof : How do you prove someone's pattern was interfered with? The pattern is what it is now. You'd need evidence of what it was before\u2014which requires trusting old readings, which could also have been fraudulent. Pattern Trafficking Definition : Trading in pattern information without authorization. The Market : Pattern data has value. Employers want it. Lenders want it. Families want it. Criminals want it. There's money in knowing someone's pattern. Legal Status : Authorized Access : Loom-readers, Wardens, certain officials can access patterns legitimately. Regulated Trade : Some jurisdictions allow pattern-data sale with consent. Buy someone's pattern-reading for credit approval? Legal if they agreed. Black Market : Unauthorized readings. Stolen data. Readings sold without subject's knowledge. Illegal everywhere. The Infrastructure : Pattern trafficking requires access to Loom-engines, which are controlled. Black market depends on corrupt readers, stolen equipment, or unregulated nodes. Contract Law and Pattern The Enforceability Problem A contract is a meeting of minds, creating mutual obligation. But on H\u00e1lcova: The Loom knew you'd sign before you did Your pattern may have made signing inevitable Your future capacity to fulfill was predictable The other party may have known your pattern and exploited it When Is a Contract Void? Pattern Exploitation : If one party knew the other's pattern predicted failure, and structured the deal to profit from that failure, is the contract predatory? Orthodox Position : Patterns are public information. Using it is prudent, not exploitative. Caveat emptor. Reformist Position : Information asymmetry this extreme vitiates consent. Pattern-exploitation contracts should be voidable. Prediction Manipulation : If the contract was designed to create the outcome the pattern predicted\u2014if the prediction is self-fulfilling because the contract makes it so\u2014is that fraud? Example : Lender gives loan to \"failure pattern\" debtor at crushing terms. Terms guarantee failure. Lender profits from failure. The pattern was accurate because the contract made it accurate. Deviation Clauses : Some contracts include provisions for deviation. \"If Party A deviates from predicted behavior, contract is void.\" This incentivizes pattern-compliance\u2014or punishes the rare genuine choice. Pattern-Contingent Contracts Contracts explicitly tied to pattern outcomes: Futures : \"I will pay X if your pattern manifests outcome Y.\" Insurance : \"I will cover losses from outcome Y unless pattern indicated Y.\" Bonds : \"My pattern predicts success; I bond myself against failure.\" Marriage : \"We agree to join contingent on compatible patterns remaining compatible.\" These contracts treat pattern as fact\u2014and create massive markets around prediction accuracy. The Assignment Problem Can you transfer your pattern? Your fate? Your predicted outcomes? No : Pattern is inherent. You can't give someone else your destiny. Sort Of : You can transfer economic interests in your pattern. Sell shares in your predicted success. Assign rights to your Residue upon death. Create instruments based on your predicted trajectory. Resulting Instruments : Fate Futures : Tradeable contracts based on predicted pattern-outcomes. Death Bonds : Instruments that pay upon subject's death (incentives get dark quickly). Residue Rights : Assignable claims to the Residue someone's death will produce. These markets exist, are regulated inconsistently, and create incentives the designers probably didn't intend. Criminal Procedure and Pattern Pattern Evidence in Criminal Trials Prosecution Use : \"Defendant's pattern includes 'will commit violence.' This act was predicted. Defendant is the predicted perpetrator.\" Defense Use : \"Defendant's pattern doesn't include this crime. The Loom didn't predict it. Wrong suspect.\" The Problem : Pattern evidence is probabilistic. Patterns don't specify every action. A \"violence pattern\" doesn't mean this specific violence. A clean pattern doesn't mean incapable of crime. Actual Practice : Heartlands: Pattern evidence is admissible, weighted, but not dispositive. Pattern supports other evidence; rarely convicts alone. Shattered Reaches: Pattern evidence officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely. Vent Lands: Pattern evidence is secondary to material evidence. Actions matter more than predictions. Far Shelf: Pattern evidence excluded. \"Patterns don't commit crimes; people do.\" Pre-Crime Intervention The Temptation : The Loom predicts future behavior. Why wait for the crime? Arguments For : Prevention is better than punishment Victims are protected before they're harmed Deterrence works better when intervention precedes action Arguments Against : Punishing non-actions is unjust Prediction isn't certainty; innocents will be punished Creates the outcome it predicts (treating someone as criminal makes them criminal) Where does it end? Every \"bad pattern\" becomes pre-criminal? Actual Practice : Heartlands: Limited pre-crime intervention. \"Dangerous patterns\" may be monitored, required to register, restricted in travel or occupation. Actual detention requires additional evidence. Other regions: Generally reject pre-crime detention. Monitoring may occur. Far Shelf: Explicitly prohibits pattern-based pre-crime action. \"The crime is the crime. The pattern is not the crime.\" Sentencing and Pattern If pattern predicts recidivism, should sentences be longer? Incapacitation Argument : Long sentences for high-recidivism patterns protect society. The prediction justifies the extension. Justice Argument : Punishment should fit the crime committed, not crimes predicted. Sentencing the future is unjust. Practical Reality : Most jurisdictions use pattern information in sentencing, openly or covertly. Judges are human; they have access; they use it. The Data : Jurisdictions that pattern-adjust sentences show... complex results. Lower recidivism among released (because predicted-recidivists serve longer). But higher total incarceration. And the prediction accuracy is confounded by the intervention. Family Law and Pattern Marriage and Pattern-Compatibility The Practice : Pattern-readings are standard before marriage in most regions. Incompatible patterns are disclosed. Compatible patterns are celebrated. The Question : Should pattern-incompatibility void a marriage? Orthodox Position : Incompatible patterns should prevent marriage. Marrying against pattern is deviation. Romantic Position : Love transcends pattern. Compatibility reading is information, not mandate. Actual Practice : Heartlands requires compatibility reading; strongly discourages incompatible unions; doesn't technically forbid them. Other regions vary. The Failure Case : If a marriage fails, and the patterns predicted failure, who's responsible? Did they deviate by marrying? Did they fail to deviate sufficiently to save it? Inheritance and Pattern The Issue : If your pattern predicts wealth-accumulation, is your wealth \"earned\"? If your heir's pattern predicts squandering, should they inherit? Orthodox Position : Wealth flows according to pattern. Inheritance is pattern-expression. Let it flow. Reformist Position : Pattern-based inheritance entrenches inequality. Use inheritance taxes, estate limitations, pattern-blind distribution. Actual Practice : Heartlands allows pattern-conditional inheritance (\"to my heir, unless their pattern indicates X\"). Other regions vary. Custody and Pattern The Nightmare Case : Parents divorcing. Child's pattern is read. One parent's pattern is \"compatible with child-raising.\" Other's isn't. Who gets custody? Pattern-Determinists : Pattern-compatible parent should raise the child. Outcomes will be better. The evidence is predictive. Pattern-Skeptics : Parenting isn't predictable this way. Pattern-reading is too coarse. Use traditional best-interests analysis. Actual Practice : Pattern evidence is used in custody disputes almost everywhere, despite controversy. Judges claim it's one factor among many. Critics note it's often decisive. Property Law and Pattern Acquisition and Pattern If your pattern predicts you'll acquire property X, and you acquire property X, did you \"earn\" it? If someone else's pattern predicted they'd acquire X, and you got it instead, did you steal their destiny? The Orthodox Answer : Pattern predicts, doesn't entitle. You own what you legally acquire. Pattern is descriptive, not prescriptive. The Uncomfortable Implication : Pattern-privileged people will acquire more, reliably. This isn't injustice\u2014it's fate. The system is working correctly. The Reformist Answer : Pattern-advantage is unearned. Tax it. Redistribute from pattern-privileged to pattern-constrained. Residue Rights When someone dies, their Pattern Residue is released. Who owns it? Traditional View : The estate. Residue rights are property, inheritable, transferable. Reform View : Residue belongs to the community. The death happened here; the Residue should serve here. Radical View : Residue shouldn't be property. It's sacred / dangerous / collective. Commodifying death commodifies people. Actual Practice : Residue is property almost everywhere. The economic system depends on it. Reform efforts have failed. Radical positions are marginalized. The Loom's Property Status Who owns the Loom? Orthodox Position : The Loom is divine infrastructure. No one owns it. The Church administers it on behalf of The Weaver. Secular Position : The Loom is technology. Someone built it. Someone maintains it. That someone has property interests. Practical Answer : The Loom is controlled by the Orthodox Church in the Heartlands. Nodes elsewhere have various ownership (government, guild, private).

Warden Order Legal Authority Jurisdictional Claims The Warden Order claims authority to: - Investigate pattern-crimes anywhere patterns exist - Arrest deviants, fraudsters, evaders, interferers - Conduct trials (ecclesiastical courts in Heartlands, treaty-authorized elsewhere) - Execute sentences including death (Pattern-Severance) Basis for Authority In Heartlands : Embedded in government. Warden authority is state authority. In Shattered Reaches : Treaty-based. Specific rights negotiated with specific polities. Varies by jurisdiction. In Middle Waters : Colonial extension. Wardens operate in Heartlands-controlled zones. Contested elsewhere. In Vent Lands : Guild-negotiated limits. Wardens can pursue specific crimes with guild cooperation. No independent authority. In Far Shelf : Rejected. Wardens are foreign agents without legal standing. Operating openly risks arrest. Conflicts Extradition : Heartlands demands extradition of deviants from other regions. Other regions sometimes comply (valuable trade relations), sometimes refuse (sovereignty, ideology). Pursuit Rights : Can Wardens pursue a suspect into non-Heartlands territory? Officially no (without treaty). Actually, they sometimes do. Parallel Proceedings : A crime may be tried under Warden authority and local authority simultaneously. Which verdict controls? Specific Legal Codes by Region Heartlands: The Pattern Code Structure : Ecclesiastical law (pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy) parallel to secular law (ordinary crimes). Key Features : - Deviation is a crime, prosecuted by Wardens - Pattern-fraud is both ecclesiastical and secular crime - Pattern evidence admissible in all courts - Pre-crime monitoring authorized for \"dangerous patterns\" - Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable - Residue rights are property, regulated but tradeable Distinctive Elements : - \"Pattern Certification\" required for many activities - \"Harmony Testing\" for marriage, business partnership - \"Fate Compliance Audits\" for major institutions - Death sentences produce Residue assigned to state Shattered Reaches: The Maritime Compact Structure : Common law tradition, precedent-based, decentralized by polity. Key Features : - Pattern-crimes not generally recognized (fraud excepted) - Pattern evidence officially excluded from criminal trials - Pattern-contingent contracts enforceable as private agreements - Strong arbitration tradition (pattern evidence allowed) - Residue rights are property, largely unregulated Distinctive Elements : - \"Jurisdictional Shopping\" is common and accepted - Merchant league arbitration often preferred to state courts - \"Pattern Privacy\" recognized as right (can refuse disclosure) - Warden authority limited by specific treaty provisions Vent Lands: The Guild Protocols Structure : Guild-based law. Guilds govern members; inter-guild conflicts resolved by council. Key Features : - Expertise/capability matters more than pattern - Pattern evidence secondary to demonstrated competence - Contracts based on deliverables, not predictions - Residue rights regulated by safety guild (toxic substances) - Non-guild members have limited legal standing Distinctive Elements : - \"Competence Certification\" replaces pattern certification - Guild courts handle member disputes - Inter-guild trade governed by protocols, not state law - Wardens limited to specific treaty-defined violations Far Shelf: The Autonomy Charters Structure : Decentralized. Local charters establish local rules. Weak central coordination. Key Features : - Pattern-tracking rejected where possible - Deviation not criminalized (may be celebrated) - Pattern evidence excluded from legal proceedings - Strong privacy protections - Residue rights controversial (some communities refuse commodification) Distinctive Elements : - \"Loom Refusal\" protected as right - Warden presence illegal without invitation - Community assemblies resolve disputes - Emphasis on restorative over punitive justice Summary: Legal Frameworks Compared Issue Heartlands Shattered Reaches Vent Lands Far Shelf Deviation Crime Not crime Not crime Celebrated Pattern Evidence Admissible Officially excluded Secondary Excluded Pre-Crime Limited authorization Rejected Rejected Prohibited Pattern Contracts Fully enforceable Enforceable (private) Deliverable-based Void if pattern-contingent Residue Rights Regulated property Property Safety-regulated Contested Warden Authority Full Treaty-limited Guild-limited None Further documentation needed on: Case law examples, treaty texts, jurisdictional conflict records, Warden Order procedural rules, execution protocols and Residue disposition","title":"Legal Frameworks"},{"location":"halcova/governance/legal_frameworks/#halcova-legal-frameworks-and-pattern-law","text":"","title":"H\u00e1lcova: Legal Frameworks and Pattern Law"},{"location":"halcova/governance/legal_frameworks/#overview","text":"Law in H\u00e1lcova cannot escape pattern.

H\u00e1lcova doesn't have that luxury. The S\u00f3rscad exists. It's readable. It predicts outcomes with uncomfortable accuracy. This breaks political philosophy at its foundations and forces reconstruction from first principles. The Questions That Matter What Does \"Equality\" Mean? On Earth : Equality typically means equal moral worth, equal rights, equal standing before the law\u2014regardless of observable differences in capability or circumstance. On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support. What Does \"Justice\" Mean? On Earth : Justice typically involves assigning responsibility for actions, determining appropriate responses to harm, and ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom predicted the action. Did the person choose it, or was choice an illusion? Can you punish someone for doing what they were always going to do? Can you reward someone for inevitability? The Problem : If actions are genuinely fated, punishment is incoherent. You're punishing someone for being what they were always going to be. That's not justice\u2014it's suffering added to suffering. If actions are genuinely chosen despite prediction, then deviants prove choice exists. But most people don't deviate. Are they choosing to comply, or unable to resist? Possible Positions : Consequentialist Justice : Don't worry about desert. Justice is about outcomes. Punish if punishment prevents future harm. Reward if reward produces future benefit. The person's \"choice\" is irrelevant; what matters is what works. Expressivist Justice : Punishment expresses social condemnation regardless of metaphysics. We punish not because the criminal \"deserves\" it, but because punishment communicates values. The audience matters more than the target. Restorative Justice : Forget punishment. Justice is about repairing harm. If someone's pattern predicted they'd harm others, the pattern doesn't matter\u2014the harm does. Restore the victim; reintegrate the harmer; move on. Fatalist Justice : Accept that justice is impossible in any meaningful sense. What we call \"justice\" is actually just pattern-expression. The Loom predicted we'd punish; we punish; the prediction is confirmed. Don't pretend there's more. What Does \"Consent\" Mean? On Earth : Consent means voluntary agreement, free from coercion, based on adequate information. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. If someone manipulates you into \"consenting,\" but the Loom predicted you'd be manipulated, did you consent? Can a pattern-constrained person ever meaningfully consent to anything? The Problem : Every pact, contract, and political arrangement rests on consent. If consent is illusory, every agreement is void. But if we treat consent as illusory, we've justified unlimited coercion (nothing matters anyway) or unlimited paternalism (we know better than you what you'll choose). Possible Positions : Experienced Consent : What matters is the subjective experience of choosing. Even if the choice was predicted, the person experienced deliberation, weighed options, and felt like they decided. That's consent enough. Structural Consent : Individual consent is less important than structural fairness. If the process that produces \"consent\" is rigged\u2014if pattern-constrained people are systematically pushed toward agreements that harm them\u2014then individual consent legitimizes nothing. Predictive Consent : Use the Loom to determine what someone would consent to under ideal conditions. If you know they'd agree to X if they fully understood it, you can act as if they've agreed. (This is terrifying but internally consistent.) Consent Skepticism : Consent is a useful fiction. Treat agreements as binding because a system of binding agreements works better than the alternative\u2014not because consent is metaphysically meaningful. What Legitimizes Authority? On Earth : Authority is typically legitimized by: divine mandate, consent of the governed, tradition, expertise, or force. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom adds new possibilities. Perhaps authority is legitimized by pattern\u2014some people are fated to lead. Perhaps it's legitimized by Loom-sanction\u2014the Attendance approves certain rulers. Perhaps it's legitimized by prediction\u2014whoever rules is whoever was going to rule. The Problem : If the Loom can identify \"leadership patterns,\" why wouldn't you use them? A ruler with a leadership pattern will lead better. Ignoring pattern information seems foolish. But pattern-based selection creates a closed loop. Leaders with \"leadership patterns\" rule because of their patterns, which means their ruling confirms their patterns, which legitimizes pattern-based selection. Possible Positions : Pattern-Merit : Leadership patterns are real and valuable. The best governance selects for pattern, trains those selected, and assigns authority based on predicted competence. Democracy is pattern-denial; meritocracy is pattern-acknowledgment. Anti-Pattern Democracy : The whole point of democratic governance is that it doesn't pre-select based on inherent qualities. Anyone can lead; the governed choose. Using pattern information corrupts the process. Loom Theocracy : The Attendance knows. It can identify not just leadership patterns but correct decisions. True governance asks the Loom and implements the answer. Human judgment is noise. Pragmatic Legitimacy : Who cares about philosophical legitimacy? Governance is legitimate if it works\u2014if it maintains order, produces prosperity, and retains sufficient support to continue. Everything else is decoration. Legitimacy Theories by Region The Heartlands: Orthodox Theocratic Legitimacy The Theory : The Weaver assigned patterns, including rulers' patterns. The current ruling families rule because their patterns indicated rulership. Resisting their authority is resisting divine design. The Great Loom Node validates rulers. A proper ruler's pattern is read publicly; the Attendance confirms their fate includes governance. Challenges to authority are pattern-deviations\u2014heresies as well as crimes. The Practice : Hereditary rule reinforced by pattern-reading. Succession crises resolved by Loom consultation. The Orthodox church legitimizes temporal authority; temporal authority protects church interests. The Tensions : What happens when a ruler's heir has an unsuitable pattern? What happens when the Loom predicts a ruler's failure? Who interprets the Loom's answers\u2014and who checks the interpreters? The Critique : This system conflates \"what will happen\" with \"what should happen.\" A pattern that predicts rulership doesn't make rulership right\u2014it makes it likely. The Heartlands has collapsed the difference. The Shattered Reaches: Consent and Contract Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from agreement, not from pattern. The governed choose their governors, directly or through representatives. Contracts bind because parties agreed, regardless of what their patterns predicted. Pattern information is available but isn't supposed to be decisive. A merchant with a \"failure pattern\" can still trade, still contract, still participate\u2014and if they succeed, their success is theirs. The Practice : City-states with varying governance models: direct assemblies, elected councils, hereditary positions constrained by charters, merchant leagues with voting weighted by stake. Pattern-based discrimination exists but is contested. Laws restricting pattern-discrimination coexist with private pattern-based pricing. The Tensions : Consent-based legitimacy assumes meaningful choice. Does it exist? Wealthy individuals and leagues have more power than their \"one vote\" suggests. Pattern-discrimination in private spheres undermines public equality. The Critique : The Shattered Reaches pretends pattern doesn't determine outcomes, while pattern actually determines outcomes through markets, reputation, and social sorting. Their equality is formal, not substantive. The Middle Waters: Colonial and Contested Legitimacy The Theory : Multiple legitimacy theories compete because multiple powers compete. Heartlands colonial governors claim Loom-sanctioned authority. Shattered Reaches merchant outposts claim contractual authority. Native island polities claim traditional authority. Colony Cults claim biological authority (the colony knows; the colony provides). The Practice : Overlapping jurisdictions, competing legal systems, forum shopping. A dispute might be resolved by Orthodox church court, merchant arbitration, traditional elder council, or colony-mediated consensus depending on who you ask and who has power. The Tensions : No single legitimacy framework commands universal acceptance. Power determines which framework applies in specific cases. The native population's frameworks are systematically disadvantaged. The Critique : The Middle Waters reveals that legitimacy theories are post-hoc justifications for power. Whoever wins the conflict gets to claim their theory was correct all along. The Vent Lands: Resource and Expertise Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from capability, specifically from controlling the geothermal resources that make the Vent Lands habitable. Those who understand the vents, who can keep the heat flowing and the toxins managed, have legitimate authority because everyone else will die without them. Pattern is acknowledged but less determinative\u2014the Vent Lands need engineers, not destiny-readers. Expertise matters more than prophecy. The Practice : Guild-based governance. The Thermal Engineers' Guild, the Sulfur Extractors' Guild, the Flesh Shaper Guilds (multiple, competing) form councils that make decisions by expertise-weighted negotiation. Political power flows to those who control critical infrastructure. Challenge a guild's authority, and discover how cold you get when the heat stops flowing. The Tensions : Expertise-legitimacy justifies technocracy. Those without technical skills are second-class citizens. Guilds have economic interests beyond the common good. What counts as \"expertise\" is defined by those who already have power. The Critique : The Vent Lands has replaced pattern-aristocracy with expertise-aristocracy. The content changed; the structure didn't. The Far Shelf: Resistance and Autonomy Legitimacy The Theory : Authority derives from defending the community against outside threats, primarily Heartlands imperialism and Loom-system extension. Legitimate governance is governance that keeps the Far Shelf free\u2014free from Orthodox control, free from comprehensive pattern-tracking, free from integration into the Residue economy's worst aspects. Deviation isn't crime here; it's virtue. Resisting pattern is resisting oppression. The Practice : Decentralized governance. Local assemblies with significant autonomy. Weak central coordination for external defense. Threadist and Hollow Saint influences openly present. Pattern-reading happens but isn't required. Loom coverage is thin and actively resisted. Some communities exist entirely off the Loom's network. The Tensions : \"Freedom\" often means freedom for the strong at the expense of the weak. Without Loom integration, coordination problems multiply. Resisting the Heartlands requires resources; resources require trade; trade requires compromise. The Critique : The Far Shelf's legitimacy theory is reactive\u2014defined by what it opposes rather than what it proposes. Freedom from pattern-control is clear. Freedom for what is less so. Legal Frameworks The Core Problem: Intent and Prediction Earth legal systems typically require mens rea \u2014a guilty mind. Did the person intend harm? Did they know what they were doing? Did they choose? On H\u00e1lcova, intent is partially knowable. The Loom can tell you if someone's pattern includes \"will commit violence\" or \"will deceive.\" This breaks criminal law as usually conceived. Option A: Pattern-Predictive Policing If you can predict crime, why wait for it? Arrest people whose patterns indicate future harm. Punish them before they act. Problems : - Punishing non-actions is unjust by most frameworks. - Prediction isn't certainty; false positives will be punished for nothing. - Creates the outcome it predicts (treating someone as a criminal produces criminals). Option B: Pattern-Blind Law Ignore pattern information in legal proceedings. Judge only actions, not predictions. Treat everyone as if choice is real. Problems : - You're ignoring real information. - Recidivism prediction is useful; refusing to use it costs lives. - Disadvantages those who do use pattern information (private parties, other jurisdictions). Option C: Pattern-Weighted Sentencing Let pattern information affect sentencing, not guilt. Convict based on actions; sentence based on predicted future behavior. High-recidivism patterns get longer sentences (incapacitation) or different interventions (treatment if treatable). Problems : - Still punishing the pattern, not just the action. - Unequal sentences for identical crimes based on unchosen characteristics. - Pattern-constrained populations systematically receive harsher treatment. Option D: Pattern as Mitigating Factor If someone's pattern predicted their crime, they had less choice. Less choice means less responsibility. Less responsibility means lighter punishment. Problems : - Everyone can claim their pattern made them do it. - Rewards having \"bad\" patterns (reduces consequences). - Collapses the concept of responsibility entirely. Actual Legal Variation Heartlands : Pattern-weighted sentencing plus pattern-predictive intervention for \"dangerous patterns.\" The Warden Order handles pattern-crimes (deviation, interference, evasion); secular courts handle ordinary crimes. Shattered Reaches : Officially pattern-blind, practically pattern-informed. Private arbitration uses pattern information openly. Public courts pretend not to. Middle Waters : Jurisdictional chaos. Colonial authorities, merchant courts, traditional systems, and cult mediation all compete. Pattern information matters depending on which system captures your case. Vent Lands : Expertise-based judgment. Guild courts handle guild members. Non-guild members have limited legal standing. Pattern matters less than demonstrated capability and contribution. Far Shelf : Local variation. Some communities ignore pattern entirely. Others use it for community-protective exclusion. Central coordination is minimal. Criminal Justice and Residue Production The Uncomfortable Intersection Executions produce Pattern Residue. The legal system that kills criminals is also a Residue production system. This creates incentives. The Observable Pattern : Jurisdictions with higher Residue demand have higher execution rates. Crimes that \"merit\" death penalty expand when Residue is scarce. Some jurisdictions explicitly auction execution rights (the death produces Residue; someone profits). Possible Responses : Accept and Regulate : Death is part of governance. Residue production is part of economy. Align them: execute those who deserve it; harvest the Residue; use proceeds for public good. Pretending otherwise is hypocrisy. Separate and Firewall : Residue from executions goes to neutral parties, not to the executing authority. Remove the incentive to execute for profit while acknowledging the Residue exists. Abolish Death Penalty : If execution creates economic incentive for execution, don't execute. Life imprisonment, exile, pattern-interference (if it exists), or other responses that don't produce Residue. Expose and Shame : Make the connection visible. Every death sentence comes with documentation of who profits from the Residue. Let public opinion regulate what law won't. The Heartlands Approach : Public Correction (execution for educational purposes) is an official practice. The Residue goes to the Loom infrastructure. The connection is explicit, defended on theological grounds: pattern-deviants have forfeited their pattern; their Residue serves the system they betrayed. The Far Shelf Approach : Minimal death penalty. Exile is preferred (they're not our problem anymore). When execution happens, communities often burn the body completely\u2014waste the Residue rather than let it be harvested. A statement that death isn't commodity. Property and Pattern Who Owns What\u2014and Why Does Pattern Matter? The Problem : Property rights assume you can own things, transfer things, and exclude others from things. But if your pattern determines your economic trajectory, are your property rights really yours ? If you were always going to be wealthy, is your wealth earned or destined? The Pattern-Property Intersection : Inheritance : Pattern-privileged families accumulate wealth across generations. Is this different from aristocracy? The wealth isn't legally tied to pattern\u2014but pattern predicts who accumulates it. Contracts : Pattern information affects pricing. A loan to a \"failure pattern\" costs more. A job offered to a \"success pattern\" pays more. The free market efficiently incorporates pattern discrimination. Innovation : If your pattern includes \"will invent,\" do you deserve patent rights? You didn't choose to be inventive. The pattern did the work. Possible Positions : Pattern-Libertarian : Property rights are property rights. If pattern helps you acquire property legally, the property is yours. Outcomes reflect pattern; so what? Trying to \"correct\" for pattern is theft. Pattern-Distributive : Property accumulation reflects pattern advantage, not just effort. Redistribute from pattern-privileged to pattern-constrained. The lucky shouldn't keep all their luck. Pattern-Communitarian : Property is social, not individual. The community as a whole decides allocation. Pattern information helps allocate efficiently\u2014give resources to those whose patterns will use them well. Pattern-Skeptic : Refuse to let pattern information affect property distribution. Tax wealth regardless of pattern. Provide baseline regardless of pattern. Accept inefficiency as the price of not creating caste-by-prophecy. Inter-Regional Politics The Trade Web Residue Flows : The Heartlands produces the most Residue (largest population, most warfare, most executions). They export refined Residue to regions that need it. The Middle Waters imports heavily (warm, less death, high demand for magitech). The Vent Lands imports minimally (geothermal reduces need, but high-grade Residue still valuable). The Shattered Reaches trades (imports raw, exports refined, profits on processing). The Far Shelf resists (minimal imports, local production, avoids dependency). Food Flows : The Middle Waters exports food (warmth enables agriculture). The Heartlands is roughly self-sufficient (large, diverse). The Shattered Reaches imports food (maritime diet supplemented by trade). The Vent Lands imports food (volcanic soil is limited). The Far Shelf struggles (short growing season, hunting-dependent). Labor Flows : Pattern-constrained populations migrate toward where they can survive: - Middle Waters (warmth, less Loom oversight) - Vent Lands (expertise matters more than pattern) - Far Shelf (freedom from pattern-tracking) Pattern-privileged populations concentrate where their patterns are valued: - Heartlands (pattern-merit advancement) - Shattered Reaches (commercial opportunities) The Power Balance Military Capacity : The Heartlands has the largest military, supplied by Residue abundance. They could conquer anyone\u2014if they could project force across oceans and ice. The Shattered Reaches has the best navy. They can't match Heartlands on land, but they control the seas. The Vent Lands has fortress geography. No one can invade without crossing toxic zones and thermal hazards. The Middle Waters is contested, not defensible. Whoever controls the seas controls access. The Far Shelf has space. Conquest is possible; occupation is impractical. Current Equilibrium : No one can dominate everyone. The Heartlands could crush any single rival but not all simultaneously. The Shattered Reaches can raid and embargo but not conquer land. The Vent Lands can defend but not project. The result is persistent competition without resolution. The Warden Order as Transnational Authority What They Claim The Warden Order serves pattern-integrity across all regions. Deviation is a universal threat. Heresy knows no borders. The Order operates wherever patterns exist\u2014which is everywhere. What They Actually Have Full legal authority in the Heartlands (embedded in government) Significant presence in the Shattered Reaches (treaty rights, port access) Limited presence in the Middle Waters (colonial zones only) Contested presence in the Vent Lands (guild resistance) Minimal presence in the Far Shelf (actively opposed) The Political Function The Order is a Heartlands institution claiming universal jurisdiction. Other regions accept it to varying degrees because: - Heartlands trade depends on Order-guaranteed contracts - Some deviation threats are real and cross-border - Opposing the Order means opposing the Heartlands - Internal factions find the Order useful against rivals The Resistance The Far Shelf explicitly rejects Order authority. The Vent Lands limit Order operations to specific zones. The Shattered Reaches nominally accepts but practically obstructs. The Middle Waters is battleground\u2014Order presence varies by which power controls which territory.

On H\u00e1lcova : Observable differences include fate itself . The Loom can tell you, with measurable accuracy, whether this person will contribute to society or drain it, create value or destroy it, help or harm. The Problem : If equality means \"treat everyone the same regardless of pattern,\" you're ignoring real information. A lender who ignores pattern when making loans will be outcompeted by one who doesn't. An employer who ignores pattern will hire worse workers. The system punishes equality. If equality means \"treat everyone according to their pattern,\" you've created a caste system justified by prophecy. Pattern becomes destiny not because fate is fixed, but because everyone acts as if it is. Possible Positions : Pattern Realism : Patterns are real, differences are real, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Equality is a comfortable lie. Governance should optimize for outcomes, which means differential treatment. Pattern Skepticism : Patterns predict partly because people believe them. True equality requires ignoring patterns\u2014which is costly but morally necessary. Someone has to pay the cost of treating people as if they had equal worth. Pattern Complexity : Equality doesn't mean \"same treatment.\" It means \"equal consideration of interests.\" A constrained pattern doesn't mean someone deserves less consideration\u2014it means they need different support.","title":"What Does \"Equality\" Mean?"},{"location":"halcova/governance/political_philosophy/#what-does-justice-mean","text":"On Earth : Justice typically involves assigning responsibility for actions, determining appropriate responses to harm, and ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens. On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom predicted the action. Did the person choose it, or was choice an illusion? Can you punish someone for doing what they were always going to do? Can you reward someone for inevitability? The Problem : If actions are genuinely fated, punishment is incoherent. You're punishing someone for being what they were always going to be. That's not justice\u2014it's suffering added to suffering. If actions are genuinely chosen despite prediction, then deviants prove choice exists. But most people don't deviate. Are they choosing to comply, or unable to resist? Possible Positions : Consequentialist Justice : Don't worry about desert. Justice is about outcomes. Punish if punishment prevents future harm. Reward if reward produces future benefit. The person's \"choice\" is irrelevant; what matters is what works. Expressivist Justice : Punishment expresses social condemnation regardless of metaphysics. We punish not because the criminal \"deserves\" it, but because punishment communicates values. The audience matters more than the target. Restorative Justice : Forget punishment. Justice is about repairing harm. If someone's pattern predicted they'd harm others, the pattern doesn't matter\u2014the harm does. Restore the victim; reintegrate the harmer; move on. Fatalist Justice : Accept that justice is impossible in any meaningful sense. What we call \"justice\" is actually just pattern-expression.

On H\u00e1lcova : The Loom knows whether you'll consent before you do. If someone manipulates you into \"consenting,\" but the Loom predicted you'd be manipulated, did you consent? Can a pattern-constrained person ever meaningfully consent to anything? The Problem : Every pact, contract, and political arrangement rests on consent. If consent is illusory, every agreement is void. But if we treat consent as illusory, we've justified unlimited coercion (nothing matters anyway) or unlimited paternalism (we know better than you what you'll choose). Possible Positions : Experienced Consent : What matters is the subjective experience of choosing. Even if the choice was predicted, the person experienced deliberation, weighed options, and felt like they decided. That's consent enough. Structural Consent : Individual consent is less important than structural fairness. If the process that produces \"consent\" is rigged\u2014if pattern-constrained people are systematically pushed toward agreements that harm them\u2014then individual consent legitimizes nothing. Predictive Consent : Use the Loom to determine what someone would consent to under ideal conditions. If you know they'd agree to X if they fully understood it, you can act as if they've agreed. (This is terrifying but internally consistent.) Consent Skepticism : Consent is a useful fiction.

Perhaps it's legitimized by Loom-sanction\u2014the Attendance approves certain rulers. Perhaps it's legitimized by prediction\u2014whoever rules is whoever was going to rule. The Problem : If the Loom can identify \"leadership patterns,\" why wouldn't you use them? A ruler with a leadership pattern will lead better. Ignoring pattern information seems foolish. But pattern-based selection creates a closed loop. Leaders with \"leadership patterns\" rule because of their patterns, which means their ruling confirms their patterns, which legitimizes pattern-based selection. Possible Positions : Pattern-Merit : Leadership patterns are real and valuable. The best governance selects for pattern, trains those selected, and assigns authority based on predicted competence. Democracy is pattern-denial; meritocracy is pattern-acknowledgment. Anti-Pattern Democracy : The whole point of democratic governance is that it doesn't pre-select based on inherent qualities. Anyone can lead; the governed choose. Using pattern information corrupts the process. Loom Theocracy : The Attendance knows. It can identify not just leadership patterns but correct decisions. True governance asks the Loom and implements the answer. Human judgment is noise. Pragmatic Legitimacy : Who cares about philosophical legitimacy?

In practice, nothing is cleanly divided. Pattern affects everything. A trade dispute involves pattern-certified contracts. A succession crisis requires Loom readings. A military campaign needs pattern-intelligence on enemy commanders. The Church has its fingers in every pie because pattern is in every pie. The Crown maintains legitimacy through pattern-validation. The ruling family's S\u00f3rscad includes \"governance fate\"\u2014the Loom predicts they'll rule, therefore they should rule. Circular logic that holds because everyone with power benefits from it holding. The Council of Threads advises the Crown: major noble houses, high clergy, Warden Order representatives, selected merchants. Formally advisory. Practically, the Crown can't act against unified Council opposition. The Warden Order enforces pattern-compliance. They answer to Church hierarchy but operate with significant autonomy. Their Attunement gives them abilities no one else has\u2014pattern-sense, deviation-detection, enhanced physical capacity. Magic Regulation The Heartlands doesn't ban magic. It monopolizes it. Core Binding : Licensed and regulated. The Orthodox Church maintains binding facilities where approved practitioners create echoes under supervision. Private binding is illegal but common. The Church controls Residue distribution\u2014want to bind? Buy your Residue from approved sources, register your binding, submit to periodic inspections. Flesh Shaping : Heavily restricted. The Orthodox position is that bodies are Weaver-given; reshaping them is soft heresy. Medical applications permitted under Church supervision. Cosmetic or enhancement shaping illegal. Combat modifications are treason. Reality: thriving black market serves those with money to bribe. Pact Summoning : Officially forbidden. The Elsewhere is the enemy of divine order. Pact Summoners face execution without exception. Reality: The Warden Order's Attunement looks suspiciously like a pact. Certain old families have \"ancestral arrangements.\" The rule is: official pacts are forbidden; institutional pacts are classified. Fate Threading : Capital heresy. No licenses. No exceptions. Threaders hunted with same intensity as deviants. The Warden Order has specialized units\u2014Unravelers\u2014trained specifically to identify and terminate Threaders. Colony Summoning : Tolerated at margins, prohibited at core. Legal in frontier areas. In the Heartlands proper, hosts face significant civil disabilities\u2014can't hold office, can't testify in Church courts, can't access certain Loom services. Fate System Integration Pattern Certification : Required for most activities. Employment, housing, marriage, trade, travel\u2014all require proof of pattern-reading and absence of deviation flags. Without pattern documentation, you don't legally exist. Pattern Evidence : Admissible in all courts. Pattern-prediction about defendant's likely behavior can support charges, justify pre-trial detention, influence sentencing. Deviation as Crime : The Heartlands criminalizes acting against your pattern's predictions. Deviation prosecution is selective\u2014wealthy deviants negotiate rehabilitation; poor deviants face Correction. Pre-Crime Monitoring : \"Dangerous patterns\" can be flagged for monitoring. Registration requirements. Travel restrictions. Employment limitations. Creates the outcomes it predicts. The Warden Order Jurisdiction : Pattern-crimes anywhere the Order can reach. Deviation, fraud, evasion, interference, trafficking. Powers : Detain without civilian oversight. Conduct pattern-readings without consent. Enter premises without warrant. Execute Pattern-Severance for capital pattern-crimes. The Attunement : Links Wardens to the Loom. They can sense deviation, feel pattern-disturbance, detect magic use. Cost is lifespan, flexibility, and capacity for doubt. Law and Order Ecclesiastical Courts : Handle pattern-crimes, deviation, heresy, unauthorized magic. Penalties include penance, property forfeiture, exile, and Correction (public execution producing Residue assigned to Church). Secular Courts : Handle ordinary crimes. Penalties include fines, imprisonment, labor service, and execution (Residue goes to jurisdiction). Residue from Justice : Executions produce Residue. Jurisdictions with shortages have higher execution rates. The legal system has financial interest in death. The Shattered Reaches: Fragmented Pragmatism Political Structure No unified government. Dozens of city-states, island kingdoms, merchant leagues, free ports. The only commonalities are maritime orientation and contract fetishism. The Leagues provide regional coordination. Amber League (Residue), Salt League (fishing), Iron League (manufacturing), Counting League (banking). Not governments, but they exercise governmental functions\u2014currency, contract enforcement, dispute resolution. Magic Regulation No unified policy. Common patterns emerge from commercial logic. Core Binding : Generally legal, lightly regulated. Registration and periodic inspection. Black markets for sensitive bindings. Flesh Shaping : Legal in most polities, regulated as medical practice. Guild certification required. Combat modifications restricted but available. Pact Summoning : Status varies wildly. Some criminalize all pacts. Some regulate as contracts. Most prohibit involuntary substitution\u2014creates market for \"voluntary\" substitution from desperate people. Fate Threading : Generally unregulated. Pattern-skepticism extends to Threading. Colony Summoning : Legal almost everywhere, regulated as health and safety matter. Fate System Integration Pattern Privacy : Most polities recognize pattern as private information. Can refuse readings. Pattern discrimination prohibited in public accommodations. Reality: private parties use pattern constantly. Pattern Evidence : Officially inadmissible in public courts. Private arbitration uses it freely. No Pre-Crime : Punished for what you did, not what you might do. Exception: contract-based restrictions are enforceable. The Warden Order Operates under bilateral treaties. Specific crimes only. Local cooperation required. No Pattern-Severance without local authorization. Defined duration. Law and Order Contract Supremacy : Written agreements are sacred. Courts exist primarily to interpret and enforce contracts. Maritime Law : Shared traditions recognized across polities. Arbitration : Most disputes go to private arbiters. Faster, more expert, allows pattern evidence. The Middle Waters: Colonial Patchwork Political Structure Not a region with a government\u2014a region with competing governments. Heartlands Colonies : Governors appointed, pattern-certified. Standard colonial administration. Reaches Trading Posts : League-operated commercial enclaves. Minimal government. Vent Lands Footholds : Guild-operated facilities. Governed by guild protocols. Native Polities : Surviving indigenous governance\u2014island kingdoms, elder councils, Colony Cult communities. Contested Zones : Multiple powers claim authority. Governance by whoever has force present. Magic Regulation Depends on who's in charge. Heartlands rules in colonies. Reaches rules in posts. Guild protocols in Vent facilities. Indigenous traditions in native polities. Colony Cult areas treat Colony Summoning as sacred. Some native communities have Pact Summoning traditions predating Orthodox prohibition. Fate System Integration Fragmented and contested. Full integration in Heartlands colonies. Optional in Reaches posts. Available but without legal weight in Vent facilities. Varies in native polities\u2014some integrated, some resist entirely. Native populations often understand Loom as colonizer infrastructure. Resistance to Loom is resistance to cultural imperialism. The Warden Order Full jurisdiction in colonies. Claims jurisdiction elsewhere; others don't recognize it. Pursuing suspects outside colonies means requesting cooperation or military operation. Law and Order Colonial law in Heartlands colonies\u2014harsher penalties, fewer protections. Plural legal systems in contested zones. More political violence than any other region. The Vent Lands: Guild Technocracy Political Structure Guild Federation : Primary guilds control critical infrastructure. Thermal Engineers maintain geothermal systems. Sulfur Extractors handle toxic operations. Flesh Shapers Consortium dominates biological industries. Makers Guild handles manufacturing. Merchants Assembly manages trade. Non-Guild Population : Limited legal standing, can't access guild-controlled resources directly, depend on guild good behavior. Two-tier system with explicit hierarchy. Magic Regulation Expertise-driven through guild structures. Core Binding : Legal, guild-supervised. Remembrancers' Guild handles most binding. Flesh Shaping : The Vent Lands specialty. Multiple competing guilds. World's leaders in shaping. Things illegal in Heartlands are routine here. Pact Summoning : Not criminalized. Regulated as contracts. Specialist guilds advise on Elsewhere negotiation. Fate Threading : Unregulated. Some guilds employ Threaders for specific purposes. Colony Summoning : The other Vent Lands specialty. Colony Engineering advanced here. Hosting common and normalized. Fate System Integration Expertise Over Pattern : What you can do matters more than what you're predicted to do. Guild advancement depends on demonstrated capability. No Pattern-Crimes : Deviation isn't criminalized. Pattern fraud addressed through contract law. The Warden Order Guild-negotiated limits. Specific violations only. Guild cooperation required. No independent operations. Minimal presence. Law and Order Guild Justice : Members subject to guild discipline. Penalties include fines, status reduction, expulsion. Inter-Guild Courts : Disputes between guilds. Judges from neutral guilds. Precedent-based, expertise-weighted. Safety Focus : Much law concerns safety. Geothermal systems, toxic zones, volcanic hazards require regulation. The Far Shelf: Decentralized Resistance Political Structure No Central Government : By design. Settled by people who left or fled centralized regions. Community Assemblies : Each settlement governs itself. Decision-making varies\u2014consensus, voting, elder authority, strong chiefs. Regional Coordination : Occasional gatherings for external threats. No standing structure. Magic Regulation Minimal to none. Local customs vary. Core Binding : Generally accepted. Ancestor veneration traditions make binding culturally comfortable. Flesh Shaping : Varies by community. Pact Summoning : Many communities have ongoing Elsewhere relationships predating Orthodox prohibition. Hollow Saints theology originated here. Fate Threading : Sometimes celebrated. Threading represents resistance to fixed fate. Colony Summoning : Accepted, especially in colder areas. Fate System Integration Active resistance. No Pattern Certification : Most communities don't require it. Some have no Loom access. Deviation Is Not Crime : Often virtue. Successful deviants admired. Pattern Privacy : Where Loom exists, pattern is deeply private. Forced reading is assault. The Warden Order No legitimate authority. Operating openly risks arrest or violence. Covert operations only. Some communities offer bounties for captured Wardens. Law and Order Community Justice : Each community handles own disputes. No regional courts. Restorative Focus : Repair harm, reintegrate offender, exile as last resort. External Threat Focus : Much \"law\" concerns how to respond to Heartlands incursion. Cross-Regional Dynamics Magic Flows Flesh Shapers trained in Vent Lands serve clients in Heartlands (discreetly) and Reaches (openly) Pact Summoners flee Heartlands for Far Shelf or Reaches Fate Threaders survive longest in Far Shelf Colony Hosts seek Vent Lands for advanced integration Core Binders practice everywhere; sophisticated work in Heartlands and Reaches Residue Flows Heartlands produces most, exports refined Reaches imports raw, exports refined, profits on processing Middle Waters imports heavily Vent Lands imports minimally Far Shelf resists trade Jurisdictional Conflicts Extradition : Heartlands demands; others sometimes comply, sometimes refuse. Hot Pursuit : Treaties say no; practice varies. Conflicting Judgments : A practitioner convicted in Heartlands may live legally in Reaches. The Uneasy Equilibrium No region can impose its system on others. Heartlands can't project force effectively. Reaches controls seas but not land. Vent Lands can defend but not attack. Far Shelf can absorb any invasion. The system persists because everyone fears what would replace it.

Every magical tradition operates on the same fundamental truth: you must spend something real to gain something real. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no clever tricks that let you escape the cost. The universe keeps ledgers, and it always collects. The five magical traditions\u2014collectively called the Five Arts\u2014each represent a different answer to the question: What are you willing to pay? Art What You Spend What You Get What It Costs You Core Binding The dead Echoes of the deceased Your sense of self (bleed corruption) Flesh Shaping Blood and meat Constructed servants Your body and humanity Pact Summoning Your soul Elsewhere entities Your autonomy and existence Fate Threading Your future Versions of yourself Your potential and becoming Colony Summoning Corpses and biomass Fungal constructs Your identity and bodily sovereignty Each Art is a transaction. Each transaction has fine print. Nobody reads the fine print until it's too late. Category One: Core Binding The Art of Holding the Dead Fundamental Principle When a living thing dies, something remains. Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental. The core is the imprint of what a creature was: its patterns, its memories, its essence compressed into something that can be harvested, stored, and summoned. Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't. That's the relationship. The Core What It Is The core is harvestable from anything that dies. Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete - Deaths in old age after long decline Anchors Physical Form A core needs a home. The anchor is a physical object that houses the bound echo\u2014a prison dressed as a portrait. Anchors can take many forms: - Carved figurines or statuettes - Painted tiles or tablets - Etched metal plates - Clay tablets with pressed images - Bone carvings - Jewelry settings - Decorated containers The anchor must depict the bound echo. This can happen two ways: Natural manifestation : The anchor changes when a core is bound to it, the image of the echo appearing on or in the material as if etched by invisible hands. Artistic creation : The binder creates the depiction deliberately, crafting an image of the creature to be bound before or during the binding process. Looking at a binder's collection tells you who they carry. The echoes watch out from their prisons, rendered in whatever medium houses them. Carrying Capacity A binder can carry as many anchors as they can physically transport. The limitation isn't storage\u2014it's activation. Summoning and Limits Activation To summon an echo, a binder activates its anchor. The echo manifests physically, drawn from the anchor into material reality. It can interact with the world, fight, speak, perform tasks\u2014everything the living creature could do. The Bottleneck Multiple simultaneous activations create problems: Resonance interference : Too many active echoes at once causes bleeding between them. Their memories mix. Their identities blur. Two echoes might start sharing the same thought, speaking in unison, losing track of which one is which. Physical drain : Every active echo taxes the binder. The more echoes active, the greater the exhaustion. Running too many is like holding your breath\u2014eventually something gives. The limit is personal. Some binders can run four echoes comfortably. Others struggle with two. Veterans know their limit exactly. Amateurs find out the hard way, usually when their echoes start merging into something that used to be two people and is now neither. Upkeep: The Resource [RESOURCE NAME: TBD \u2014 Placeholder for Conlang] Echoes don't maintain themselves. They need fuel\u2014a consumable resource that keeps them coherent and stable. What It Does The resource feeds the anchor, which feeds the echo. Without regular doses: - The echo becomes confused - Memories fragment and scramble - Identity degrades - Eventually, what you summon isn't what you bound\u2014it's a broken thing that used to be a person Resource Economy The resource creates an entire economy: - Harvesters who collect it from sources - Refiners who process it into usable form - Merchants who trade it - Smugglers who move it illegally - Black markets for rare or potent variants Consumption Rates Simple echoes (animals, simple minds): low consumption Complex echoes (humans, intelligent creatures): moderate consumption Powerful or traumatic echoes: high consumption Echoes that have become aware : highest consumption An echo that realizes it's dead burns through resources faster. The awareness creates strain\u2014the echo fighting against its condition, the anchor struggling to contain something that wants out. Aware echoes require constant upkeep and intensive focus. Quality Matters The resource can be: - Adulterated (stretched with fillers\u2014causes instability) - Counterfeited (fake\u2014causes degradation) - Aged (loses potency over time) - Fresh (most effective, most expensive) Experienced binders can assess quality by look, smell, even taste. They know when they're being cheated. They know when the resource is good enough to maintain a difficult echo, or only good enough for simple ones. Scarcity as Plot Peace is expensive for binders. Whatever the resource turns out to be, it's easier to acquire during times of mass death\u2014wars, plagues, disasters. Stability means scarcity. Scarcity means hard choices about which echoes get maintained and which get neglected. Decay: Echo Bleed The One-Way Corruption Holding echoes costs you. Not in resource or effort\u2014in self . The echoes bleed into you. Their memories, sensations, preferences, fears\u2014they leak from anchor to holder over time. Manifestations Phantom sensations : You feel echoes of how they died. Carry someone who burned, and your skin prickles with heat. Carry someone who drowned, and you're short of breath in open air. Behavioral drift : You pick up habits that aren't yours. Preferences shift. You hate a food you used to love. You flinch at dogs, and you've never had a bad experience with dogs\u2014but one of your echoes did. Memory intrusion : Flashes of their life. A spouse's face you've never seen. A childhood home that isn't yours. The more you carry, the more other lives crowd into your head. Awareness Accelerates Decay An echo that knows it's dead creates more bleed. The awareness is like a wound that won't close\u2014the echo's distress seeping constantly into the binder. The Long-Term Cost Old binders are strange. Their mannerisms are patchwork\u2014bits and pieces of everyone they've ever carried. Some lose track of which memories are theirs. Some find their original personality buried under layers of accumulated dead. The joke among binders: \"Carry enough echoes, and you don't know who you are. Carry them long enough, and it doesn't matter\u2014you're all of them now.\" Release It's Possible A binder can release an echo. Break the bond, let the core dissipate, allow what remains to finally end. It's Rare Reasons not to release: Money : Echoes are assets. Valuable ones are worth fortunes. Spite : \"You don't get to rest until I say so.\" Revenge : \"You'll serve me until I'm done with you.\" Nostalgia : \"I can't let go. They're all I have left of her.\" Love : \"If I release him, he's really gone. As long as I hold him, he's still here.\" Exhaustion : \"Releasing feels like losing them again. I already lost them once.\" Most binders hold on long past the point of reason. The relationship between binder and echo is complicated\u2014captor and prisoner, owner and owned, but also something that can feel like partnership, even family. Releasing is admitting it's over. Most people aren't good at that. Opposition The echoes don't know they're dead. So who objects? The living. Family members : Someone recognizes a bound echo. Their mother. Their brother. Their child. The echo doesn't understand why this stranger is crying and begging the binder to \"let them go.\" The family member understands too well. Religious/philosophical groups : Traditions that believe the dead deserve passage, that binding is desecration, that what binders do is cosmic crime. Some are peaceful advocates. Some are violent abolitionists. Former binders : People who released their echoes and now crusade against the practice. Converts are the most zealous preachers. \"I know what it's like to hold someone against their will. I know what I told myself to justify it. I'm not letting anyone else live that lie.\" Governments : Not opposed to binding\u2014opposed to uncontrolled binding. They want to regulate who gets to keep their dead. Registration. Taxation. Restrictions on certain echoes (public figures, criminals, military personnel). The opposition isn't moral; it's bureaucratic. Economy The Trade in Death Cores are commodities. Rare and powerful ones command high prices. An entire economy exists around death: Poachers : Hunting rare creatures specifically for their cores Assassins : Paid to kill specific targets so their cores can be harvested Battlefield scavengers : Following armies, collecting from the dead before anyone else can Professional harvesters : Legitimate (sometimes) businesspeople who specialize in core extraction Brokers : Connecting buyers with sellers, taking a cut Appraisers : Determining the value of a core before sale Storage facilities : Keeping anchors safe for clients who can't maintain their own collections Wars aren't just political events. They're market opportunities. Every battle produces inventory. Anomalies What Happens If You Extract a Core from Something Still Alive? It shouldn't be possible. The core is what remains after death. It forms because of death. But some have tried. Some have succeeded, after a fashion. The results are anomalies : The original creature, still alive, but wrong . Missing something fundamental. Walking and talking but hollow in a way that unnerves everyone who meets them. The extracted core, bound to an anchor, but wrong . An echo of someone who isn't dead, containing memories the original is still making. Or both. A living person and their echo, existing simultaneously, neither quite complete. Anomalies are rare, disturbing, and valuable to certain collectors. They're also deeply unstable\u2014the situation resolves eventually, usually badly for everyone involved. Terminology (To Be Developed in Conlang) The essence/soul concept: Core \u2192 [L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9] The act of binding: Binding \u2192 [C\u00f3itcai] The summoned manifestation: Echo \u2192 [TBD] The physical housing: Anchor \u2192 [TBD] The practitioner: Binder \u2192 [TBD] The consumable resource: [TBD] \u2192 [TBD] The corruption effect: Bleed \u2192 [TBD] Category Two: Flesh Shaping (Homunculus Crafting) The Art of Building Servants Fundamental Principle Flesh Shaping creates homunculi \u2014constructed servants built from raw materials and animated with blood. Unlike echoes, homunculi never lived. They have no history, no memories, no existence prior to their creation. They are made , not captured. This sounds cleaner than Core Binding. It isn't. The horror is different, not lesser. Creation Raw Materials A homunculus is built from physical components: Flesh (from corpses, butcher shops, battlefields) Bone (structural support, framework) Clay (crude but durable) Metal (for specialized purposes) Wax (malleable, temporary) Leather (flexible, resilient) Different materials produce different results. The medium shapes the creation: Bone-wrights build skeletal servants\u2014light, fast, clicking when they move Flesh-sculptors work in meat and muscle\u2014things that bleed when cut, that smell like bodies Clay-formers make crude laborers\u2014durable, slow, expressionless Metal-smiths forge mechanical servants\u2014precise, cold, expensive A crafter typically specializes. Working in multiple materials requires different skills, different tools, different mindsets. The Spark: Blood Materials alone produce nothing but a statue. The homunculus needs life , and that life comes from blood. Creation Cost The crafter bleeds into their creation. Not a nick, not a small cut\u2014a letting . The amount scales with complexity: Simple tool (a fetching hand, a watching eye): A cupful. Dizziness, hunger afterward. Basic servant (follows instructions, performs labor): Several cups. Pale for days, sleeping hard, eating constantly. Soldier construct (built for violence): Enough to leave you bedridden for a week. Some crafters need transfusions. Mimic (passes for human): Crafters have died on the table finishing these, bled out with hands still inside the chest cavity, shaping the last chamber of a heart. The homunculus must be sparked with the crafter's own blood . This is the bond. This is why it serves you and not someone else. Your blood is the signature on the contract. Conjuring and Tethering Tethering A completed homunculus can be bound to a token \u2014a small object similar to a Core Binder's anchor. The homunculus was made for this token, crafted with the binding built in from the start. When dormant, the homunculus collapses into the token. Not destroyed\u2014folded. Compressed. Waiting. Where it waits is unclear. Crafters disagree. Some say the homunculus enters a kind of stasis. Others believe it exists in a pocket dimension tied to the token. Others think it simply ceases to exist until summoned, recreated each time from the pattern stored in the binding. Nobody knows for certain. The homunculi don't remember dormancy, or if they do, they can't describe it. Summoning Activate the token, and the homunculus unfolds back into reality. Fast for simple constructs\u2014they snap into existence almost instantly. Slower for complex ones\u2014they need time to become , flesh knitting together, bones locking into place, the body assembling itself from nothing visible. Every summoning costs fresh blood. The homunculus drinks when it wakes. Small ones need a palm-slice and a minute of feeding. Larger ones need significantly more. A crafter summoning a soldier-construct is opening veins, not cutting palms. Upkeep: The Blood Economy Daily Feeding The token drinks too. When you collapse a homunculus back to dormancy, the token takes a drop. Just a drop. Daily maintenance, whether you summon that day or not. Miss a day: The token goes cold, inert. You'll need a full summoning-price to wake it again. Miss a week: The homunculus inside starts to degrade. Patterns corrupting. Miss a month: What comes out when you finally feed it won't be what you put in. A crafter is always bleeding . Six constructs means six drops a day, minimum. Morning ritual: a knife and a row of hungry objects. The Homunculus Doesn't Care Whose Blood It needs the crafter's blood to be made . But once it exists, it can be sustained on anyone's. The temptation is always there: - You're tapped out, anemic, exhausted - There's a prisoner in the basement - There's a beggar who won't be missed - There's animal blood available (but it makes constructs sluggish, wrong) - Human blood works best - Your blood works best of all, but you're running out The Supply Chain Where does the blood come from? Bloodhouses : Places where the desperate sell by the pint. Technically legal in some jurisdictions. The sellers are gaunt, hollow-eyed, always cold. They don't last long. Fresh ones cycle in. Nobody asks where the old ones went. Wartime crafters : Military Flesh Shapers have access to prisoners, wounded enemies, civilians in occupied territory. A soldier-construct requires a lot of fuel. The supply chain gets dark fast. The black market : Blood dealers who don't ask questions about sourcing. The Homunculus Knows It can smell blood. It can tell the difference between: - Willing and unwilling - Healthy and sick - Its maker and a stranger - Fear-blood and calm-blood Some crafters swear their constructs behave differently depending on what they've been fed: - More vicious on fear-blood - Sluggish on the blood of the drugged - Eager when they've tasted someone they'll meet again What This Does to Crafters Physical Markers Pale. Always. The healthy glow is for people who keep their blood inside. Hungry. Constantly eating, body trying to rebuild what they keep giving away. They're thin despite the meals. Track marks. The crook of the elbow, the wrist, anywhere veins are easy to reach. Old scars and fresh wounds. Behavioral Changes Territorial about blood. Other people's injuries make them attentive in uncomfortable ways. A nosebleed at dinner and every crafter in the room goes still for a second. They know things about blood they shouldn't. Can tell by smell if someone's sick. Can taste pregnancy, disease, fear. The knowledge seeps in. Occupational hazard. The Long-Term Cost The old ones are brittle. Bones thin. Healing slow. They've given too much for too long. Some switch to \"volunteers\" early, preserving themselves at the cost of others. Some hold out until their body forces the choice. Some just... stop making the choice and let a construct drink the last of them. A Flesh Shaper who's been practicing for decades is a medical wreck held together by stubbornness and careful feeding schedules. Hierarchy of Constructs Tools Simple, single-purpose. A hand that fetches. A mouth that repeats messages. An eye that watches. Barely present\u2014more automation than entity. Cheap to make, cheap to maintain. Every crafter has a few. Servants More complex. Can follow multi-step instructions, adapt to obstacles, perform labor. They have enough presence to seem almost like people, though nobody's fooled up close. The backbone of any serious crafter's stable. Soldiers Built for violence. Expensive in materials and spark\u2014a soldier-construct might represent months of work and enough blood loss to hospitalize the crafter. They degrade faster than other types. Combat tears them up, and they don't heal\u2014they have to be repaired . Field repairs are crude. Proper maintenance requires a workshop, materials, and more blood. Mimics The dangerous ones. Built to pass as human. Built to fool people who know what homunculi look like. Built, sometimes, to impersonate a specific person. Requirements: - Exceptional skill - Massive vitality investment - Often a core fragment from someone who knew how to be a person (burned in the creation, not bound\u2014but the traces remain) Mimics are assassins' tools. Spies. Replacements. Most societies ban them outright. Crafters who build them are either very powerful, very well-protected, or very desperate. The Homunculus Perspective What They Want They're made to serve. They don't want things the way people do. Except blood. Blood is the one drive that's built in, inescapable. A well-fed homunculus is loyal, precise, obedient. A hungry one gets creative about fulfilling its primary need. Neglected Constructs What happens when a homunculus isn't fed properly: Returns to dormancy on its own, drinking the token to survive Stands very still near sleeping people \"Accidentally\" causes injuries during tasks Simply attacks, if starved long enough This isn't rebellion. It isn't malice. It's just need \u2014the only need they have\u2014expressing itself when the leash gets loose. Do They Have Experiences? Complex homunculi exhibit preferences, aversions, something that looks like pain when damaged. They respond to stimuli in ways that suggest inner states. But they never lived. They have no history, no childhood, no formation. Whatever they experience, it's not the same as what people experience. Is it real? Does it matter if it acts real? Crafters disagree. Some treat their constructs as tools. Some treat them as servants. A few treat them almost as children\u2014made things that deserve consideration despite their origins. The homunculi themselves don't seem to have opinions on the matter. Or if they do, they don't share them. Moral Angle What Does Flesh Shaping Exploit? The crafter : Every homunculus costs a piece of you. Noble self-sacrifice or slow suicide dressed as craft? The materials : Where do you get the flesh? The bone? Flesh Shapers haunt graveyards, battlefields, slaughterhouses. They make deals with executioners. They show up after disasters with empty carts. The blood supply : When your blood runs low, whose do you use? The ethics get murky fast. The homunculi : Do they deserve consideration? They experience something. They can suffer, or at least they act like they can. Does their artificial origin excuse how we treat them? The crafter who says \"it's just a construct\" sounds a lot like the binder who says \"it's just an echo.\" The rationalization is different. The function is the same. Opposition and Social Position How Other Practitioners See Them Core Binders view Flesh Shapers as butchers playing with corpse-meat. \"At least we work with what was . You're just... building things out of scraps.\" Pact Summoners don't understand why anyone would work so hard when you could just make a deal. Fate Threaders see them as limited\u2014\"You can only make what you can build.\" Colony Summoners and Flesh Shapers have professional overlap. Some respect. Some rivalry. Similar materials, different methods. Public Perception Flesh Shapers are openly unsettling. Their workshops smell like death. Everyone knows where the materials come from. In some places, they're tolerated as necessary\u2014military applications, dangerous labor, tasks nobody else will do. In others, they're shunned. The craft is legal but shameful. You hire one when you need one, and you don't invite them to dinner. Legal Status Regulation focuses on the crafter , not the product: Licensing requirements Restrictions on mimic construction Blood sourcing laws (where they exist) Limits on military applications The homunculus itself isn't a citizen, was never a citizen, can't become a citizen. It's property. What happens to it is the crafter's business, as long as the crafter follows the rules. Terminology (To Be Developed in Conlang) The practice: Flesh Shaping \u2192 [TBD] The created servant: Homunculus \u2192 [TBD] The tethering object: Token \u2192 [TBD] The practitioner: Crafter / Flesh Shaper \u2192 [TBD] The blood cost: The Letting \u2192 [TBD] Construction specialties: Bone-wright, Flesh-sculptor, Clay-former \u2192 [TBD] The dangerous ones: Mimic \u2192 [TBD] Category Three: Pact Summoning (The Elsewhere) The Art of Dealing with the Outside Fundamental Principle Somewhere adjacent to reality, things exist. Not dead things\u2014Core Binding covers the dead. Not made things\u2014Flesh Shaping builds those. These are entities that are , fully and independently, in a place that isn't here. The Elsewhere is what practitioners call that place. The entities there have their own drives, their own intelligence, their own agendas. For reasons nobody fully understands, some of them are willing to answer when called. Pact Summoning is negotiation. Unlike the other Arts, you're not in control. You're making a deal with something that has its own reasons for saying yes. The Elsewhere What It Is Mystery is load-bearing here. The Elsewhere isn't mapped, isn't understood, isn't safe to investigate. What's known: It's not an afterlife. The dead don't go there. Cores don't come from there. It's not a spirit world. It's not a reflection of our reality. It's somewhere genuinely alien. Time works differently. Entities reference events that haven't happened yet. They remember pacts made with summoners' ancestors\u2014ancestors who haven't made those pacts yet, by our timeline. Space is wrong. The few descriptions from people who claim to have glimpsed it are contradictory. Too many angles. Colors that hurt. Distance that doesn't correlate with movement. The entities there aren't gods. Aren't demons in a religious sense. Aren't faeries in a folkloric sense. Different cultures use all those words, but none of them are accurate. They're other . Intelligences that evolved\u2014if \"evolved\" means anything there\u2014in a place with different rules than ours. Why They Answer Unknown. Theories: They want something from our world that they can't get otherwise Our reality is entertainment, or food, or raw material They're curious They're compelled by the calling ritual (unlikely\u2014they can choose not to respond) Different entities have different reasons The uncertainty is part of the horror. You're dealing with something, and you don't know why it's dealing with you. The Pact Formation Making a pact requires contact: Rituals : Specific words, gestures, offerings that attract attention from the Elsewhere Thin places : Locations where the boundary between here and there is weak Resonant objects : Items that have been touched by Elsewhere influence, that carry traces of prior contact Bloodlines : Families that have dealt before. The connection persists across generations. The entities remember. The entity chooses whether to engage. You can call. It doesn't have to answer. Some calls go unanswered for years. Some are answered immediately. Some are answered by something other than what you were trying to reach. Negotiation Pact terms are negotiated. Both parties bring something to the table. The entity is at least as intelligent as you. Probably more intelligent. Certainly more experienced\u2014it's been doing this longer than your civilization has existed. The pact, once formed, binds both sides. Break it and there are consequences. For you. Possibly for the entity too, which is why they're careful about terms. The Price Is You The entity wants your core . The same thing a Core Binder would harvest from your corpse. But the Elsewhere entity takes it in installments. Every summoning. Every use of the pact's power. Every favor called in. Each one costs a piece of you. You feel it: - A coldness that doesn't warm - Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix - The sense that you're less than you were yesterday, in a way you can't name The Honest Horror Pact entities are honest. That's part of what makes them terrifying. No tricks. No hidden clauses. No surprises. The entity tells you exactly what's going to happen: I will eat you, slowly, and in exchange you get this. And people say yes anyway. The Math of Desperation Why Would Anyone Agree? Power now, death later. For someone with nothing, that's a trade worth making. You get decades of capability in exchange for a shorter life. If your life was going to be short and powerless anyway, this is an upgrade. The timeline is negotiable. Small pacts, small bites. Use the power sparingly, and you might get decades before the debt comes due. Use it constantly, and you might have months. Some people don't plan to live long anyway. Soldiers. Assassins. The terminally ill. The suicidal. The entity offers a way to matter before the end. Arrogance. The belief that you'll find a way out. That you're smarter than everyone who came before. That you'll be the one to beat the system. You won't be. But you'll believe it until you don't. Substitution You Can Pay with Other People's Souls You can only offer your own core to one entity. That's your primary pact. But you can offset your debt by providing other cores. The entity doesn't care whose core it gets. A core is a core. But you have to deliver . Classic Arrangements First-born clauses : The child isn't born yet. You're mortgaging a future you can't see. By the time the debt comes due, you've had years to love what you promised away. Seventh son of a seventh son : Rare cores are worth more. One exceptional soul might buy you years off your own debt. Designated sacrifices : Prisoners. Slaves. The defeated. If you can deliver someone's core to the entity, it counts. How you get it is your problem. Secondary Markets This creates economies within economies: Pact summoners hunting for substitutes Cults breeding or kidnapping to pay their founders' debts Wars fought partly to generate currency for Elsewhere transactions Noble families trading heirs' futures for political advantage Criminal organizations offering \"debt relief\" in exchange for services The entities don't judge. They just collect. Breaking the Pact You Can't The terms are the terms. You agreed. The entity will collect what it's owed, one way or another. However The entity can die. They're not gods. They're powerful, alien, long-lived\u2014but not immortal. Kill your pact-partner and the contract dissolves. You keep whatever's left of your core. This is rare. Elsewhere entities are hard to find when they don't want to be found. Harder to hurt when they're found. They know they have enemies, and they're careful. But it happens. Some summoners spend their entire lives searching for a way to kill what they owe. Other entities might help. Faction politics in the Elsewhere mean your creditor's enemies might be willing to deal. You could trade one pact for another. One master for another. Out of the pot, into the fire. Early collection. If the entity decides you're more trouble than you're worth, it can call the debt due. All of it. At once. You don't survive that. But at least you're not in debt anymore. Evil Genie Escapes It does happen\u2014rarely\u2014that someone wriggles out through a loophole. A technicality. A desperate gambit the entity didn't anticipate. These cases become legends. They're also why entities have gotten very, very good at writing airtight terms over the millennia. If you think you've found a loophole, you probably haven't. The entity has seen your trick before. Usually from someone much smarter than you. The Summoning What Happens When You Call The entity arrives. Not from an anchor, not from a token\u2014it manifests . The transition is visible. Uncomfortable to witness. Air pressure changes Light bends wrong, casting shadows that don't match objects Temperature shifts\u2014sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes both in different parts of the room The smell of somewhere else. No one can describe it. Everyone recognizes it. The Relationship The entity isn't your servant. It's your contractor . It does what the pact specifies. If you negotiated well, that's a lot. If you didn't, it might technically fulfill the letter while violating the spirit. It knows every trick you know, and many you don't. Duration and power depend on pact terms and what you've paid recently. Use the connection sparingly, and you get modest manifestations. Burn through your remaining soul fast, and you can call forth something terrifying. The entity can refuse if you're asking for something outside the agreement. It can renegotiate. It can leave if the terms allow. You're not its master. You're its customer. There's a difference. What They Look Like It Varies Appearance depends on faction, individual nature, and possibly what your mind can process: Geometric : Wrong angles. Shapes that fold in directions that don't exist. Looking at them too long makes your eyes water. Almost biological : Too many limbs. Limbs that aren't limbs. A face close enough to human to be worse than something completely alien. Sensory rather than visual : A sound that has location. A pressure that has opinions. A smell that watches you. Changing : Different every time you see them. Or exactly the same, down to the shadow, no matter the lighting. Summoners in the same faction's service sometimes recognize each other's patrons. Like spotting a uniform. Or a brand. Contamination You're in Contact with the Outside You're not just paying with your core. The connection itself marks you. Manifestations Perception shifts : The boundary thins for you. You see cracks in reality where others see solid walls. Glimpses of Elsewhere bleeding through at odd moments. Dreams that aren't dreams. Resonance : Other entities notice you. You're marked as someone who deals. Some are curious. Some are hungry. Some are your patron's enemies, looking for leverage. Faction drift : Your patron's nature echoes in you. Not memories like Core Binding's bleed\u2014 tendencies . You start wanting what they want. Valuing what they value. The longer the pact, the more you serve their interests without being asked. The door : If you've given access as part of your terms, you're not always sure when it's open. Gaps in your memory. Actions you don't remember taking. The question of who's driving. The Consumed When Your Core Is Gone When a summoner's debt is fully collected: The body is still there. The soul is gone. What remains varies: A husk that breathes, blinks, maybe eats if you put food in its mouth. But nobody's home. Or something's moved in . The entity, or a piece of it, using the empty vessel. Looking out through human eyes. Or the body just stops. Heart keeps beating for a while, then doesn't. No violence, no unusual decay. Just vacancy, then nothing. Different factions leave different remains: - The Hungry leave bodies that look starved \u2014not thin, just emptied - The Mirrors leave bodies that don't move right anymore, like something's trying to remember how limbs work - The Absent leave bodies that are simply... gone. There one moment, not there the next. No one sees them leave. The Elsewhere Factions The entities aren't unified. They have allegiances, rivalries, territories. The politics are opaque to humans\u2014we catch glimpses. Wars referenced obliquely. Names spoken with something like fear. Requests that clearly serve some larger game. The full picture is never given. You're a pawn who doesn't know the board. The Accountants What They Want : Order Not justice. Not fairness. Ledgers that balance. Every debt paid. Every promise kept. Every exchange recorded. They invented the pact structure. The contract format. The terms and conditions. Other factions adopted their framework because it works. Characteristics They don't care what you do with the power. They care that the price is paid on time. Their summoners tend toward obsessive record-keeping. Counting things. Needing symmetry. Uncomfortable when anything is unbalanced. They might be the \"safest\" to deal with\u2014predictable, honorable in their way. But their honor is the honor of a loan shark. Miss a payment and they take what's owed, plus interest. What They're Really After Unknown. Possibly they're building something. A structure. A pattern. Every soul a brick in a wall no one can see. The Hungry What They Want : Sensation Our world is dense with feeling\u2014physical, emotional, experiential. The Elsewhere is thin. These entities are starving. Characteristics Pacts often include clauses about experiencing . The summoner has to feel things\u2014intensely\u2014and the entity feeds on it. Their summoners tend toward extremes. Thrill-seekers, hedonists, masochists. People who burn bright because something's drinking the flame. They're generous with power because they're getting paid in real-time. Every time you use the gift, you feel something, and they're right there, mouth open. What They're Really After More. Always more. They might not be collecting souls for any purpose beyond consumption. Just eating . And they're never full. The Architects What They Want : Change Specific changes. Moves in a game being played across centuries. They give orders that seem arbitrary\u2014stand here, say this, kill him, spare her\u2014and the pattern only becomes visible generations later. Characteristics Their summoners are pieces on a board. Useful, but not privy to the strategy. The contamination is subtle. You start thinking in long timelines. Personal goals feel small. You catch yourself making decisions that serve something larger, and you can't explain why. They might be at war with each other. Or cooperating on something vast. The summoner never knows which. What They're Really After The board to look a certain way. Our world reshaped. Not conquered\u2014 adjusted . Every soul they collect might be a piece removed from play. The Mirrors What They Want : Identity They're fascinated by selfhood\u2014the thing that makes you you and not someone else. They collect cores not as currency but as specimens. Art. Components of something they're building or becoming. Characteristics Pacts often include clauses about access . They want to wear you sometimes. See through your eyes. Make your choices. Not possession exactly\u2014more like borrowing. Their summoners have the worst contamination: identity bleed. Am I me? Was that my thought? When I wanted that, was it me wanting? They might be trying to become something. Using human cores as templates. Building a self out of stolen pieces. What They're Really After To be what we are. Or to understand it. Or to take it apart and see how it works. The souls they collect might be raw material for constructing something that can finally be . The Absent What They Want : Nothing That's what makes them terrifying. No demands, no hungers, no apparent agenda. They answer when called. They fulfill their terms. They collect what's owed. They never explain why. Characteristics Pacts with them are simple, clean, almost generous. Which makes experienced summoners deeply suspicious. Their summoners report the least contamination\u2014but also the least contact . The entity does the job and leaves. No presence, no pressure, no bleeding through. What They're Really After The only honest answer is \"we don't know.\" That might be the most dangerous answer of all. Faction Dynamics The Accountants vs. The Architects : Most friction. One wants every debt balanced now . The other lets ledgers run for centuries if it serves the plan. The Hungry : Looked down on by the others. Addicts. No sophistication. Just appetite . The Mirrors : Feared. What they're doing with the cores is wrong even by Elsewhere standards. The Absent : Make everyone nervous. You can't predict what you can't understand. What Happens to Collected Souls Unknown. Load-bearing mystery. Hints: - The Accountants file them. Somewhere. For something. - The Hungry consume them. Gone. Used up.

Every significant choice you'll face branches into potential futures. Potential yous . Fate Threading is the art of reaching into those branches and pulling. You grab a version of yourself from a choice you haven't made yet, drag them into the present, and make them real. The cost: that choice is gone. The path closes behind you. You will never become that person naturally\u2014you already extracted them. You're not mining your history. You're cannibalizing your becoming. The Core Rule Only Yourself. Only Forward. You can only pull versions of yourself from future fate-lines. No one else. Nothing from the past. No past-branch access. You decided not to become a soldier at eighteen. That soldier-you doesn't exist anymore. The choice was made. The branch collapsed. Only forward potential. You can pull from decisions you will face. The you that takes the job next month. The you that kills the man threatening your family tomorrow. The you that says yes to a proposal you haven't received yet. Always impacting your future. Every pull severs a path you could still walk. The web of your possibilities gets narrower with each extraction. The Mechanism Sensing Fate Threaders can feel their fate-web. Not clearly\u2014more like sensing pressure. Weight. Heavy futures: almost certain, highly probable, rich with consequence Light futures: unlikely, dependent on many contingencies, wispy Close futures: imminent choices, easy to grasp Distant futures: far-off possibilities, harder to reach Pulling You reach forward. Focus on a choice-point. Feel the version of yourself that exists down that path. And pull . The extraction isn't gentle. It feels like tearing something out of yourself\u2014because you are. That potential was part of you. Now it's standing next to you, a separate person. The Closure The path closes behind the pull. That choice-point is spent. When you reach that moment naturally\u2014the job offer, the marriage proposal, the crossroads\u2014the option you pulled from won't exist. You'll have to take a different path, or no path at all. What You Can Pull Any version of yourself that could exist based on choices you haven't made yet. Examples Tomorrow you face a duel. You can pull the you who wins\u2014skilled, confident, bloody-handed. (You cannot pull the you who dies. Dead futures contain nothing to extract.) Next year you might take a job with a merchant house. You can pull the you who spent a decade there, learned the trade, made the connections. But then you'll never be able to take that job naturally\u2014the future's already been harvested. You're considering marriage. You can pull the you who said yes, lived that life, raised those children. But if you pull the married-you, you've spent that future. You might still marry her, but it won't be the same. That fate-line is corrupted. What You Cannot Pull Past branches. You didn't become a soldier. That soldier doesn't exist. Gone forever. Dead futures. If a fate-line ends in your death, there's nothing to extract. Death isn't a version of you. It's the absence of you. Other people. Your fate-web contains connections to others, but you can't pull them . Only yourself. Selves from others' webs. Your brother's potential futures are his. Even if your fates are entangled, you can only pull from your own branches. The Brutal Math Youth Is Wealth Young threaders have wide webs. Lots of major choices ahead. Lots of potential selves to pull. Old threaders have narrow webs. Most choices are behind them. Most branches already collapsed through living, not pulling. The Narrowing A threader who pulls aggressively in youth might find themselves at forty with almost no remaining futures. They've spent their potential. What's left is a thin line leading to a handful of possible deaths\u2014and that's it. Every year you live, your web narrows naturally. Every pull accelerates that narrowing. The combination is a countdown. The Costs Aging Each pull costs years. Your body knows you're spending future. Hair grays. Joints ache. Skin thins. Heavy threaders look decades older than their actual age. The body is keeping score, even if the mind tries to ignore it. Coherence You're supposed to become those selves. That's how identity works\u2014you make choices, and you become the person who made them. When you rip them out prematurely, you become less. The sense of who you are gets foggy. Heavy threaders lose track of their own identity\u2014too many versions of themselves walking around, too many futures cashed out early. Some forget their own names. Not amnesia\u2014something stranger. They know they have a name. They just aren't sure which one is theirs and which one belongs to an extraction. Narrowing Web Every pull closes a path. The more you pull, the fewer futures remain. Eventually you're looking at a fate-web that's almost empty. Just the thin line of your remaining lifespan, no branches, no choices that matter, no potential left. This is visible to other threaders. A depleted fate-web looks like a dying tree\u2014sparse, brittle, few leaves. Anchoring Load The extracted selves are tethered to you. You're their origin point, and they need that connection to remain stable. While you live, they're coherent. Pull too many and your anchoring spreads thin. Neglected selves start to degrade\u2014memories corrupting, identity fragmenting. Soft cap: six to ten stable extractions, depending on the threader's strength. Push past that and they start going wrong. The Extracted Self They're you . From a choice you haven't made yet. What They Know They have your memories up to now\u2014the shared past you both lived. Then they have memories of the life they would have lived , down the fate-line you pulled them from. The soldier-you remembers the war you never fought. Knows the friends you never made, the enemies you never killed. The scholar-you remembers the books you never read. Knows the languages you never learned. They know things you don't. Skills you don't have. Experiences you skipped. What They Feel They're you. But they're also not you anymore. Loyal : They understand what you did, why you needed them. They're willing to help because you're the same person, fundamentally. Resentful : They had a life . It wasn't real yet, but it was going to be. You stole it. Collapsed their entire existence into serving the version that got to keep the body. Superior : The king-you looks at present-you and sees a lesser version. Unfinished. Unpolished. Why should he take orders from his own rough draft? Pitying : The happy-you, the peaceful-you, the one who got out\u2014they look at you and see someone still trapped in the mess they escaped. What They Can Do Anything you could do, if you'd made their choices. They have real skills, real knowledge, real capabilities. But they're not summoned tools. They're people . They make their own decisions, have their own opinions, pursue their own goals. You can ask them to help. You can try to convince them. You can't control them. Death of an Extracted Self When they die, that fate-line is destroyed. Not blocked\u2014 gone . You will never become that person. That potential is spent and destroyed. Whatever they knew, whatever they could do, is lost. The choice-point they came from? When you reach it naturally, it won't exist as an option anymore. You took it off the table by pulling and losing them. Implications Protecting your extractions matters. They're not disposable. Old threaders are cautious. They've lost extractions before. They know the cost. Suicide as weapon. An extraction that wants to hurt you can do it by dying. Kill themselves, and they take a piece of your future with them. Murder as fate-destruction. If someone kills your extractions, they're not just killing people\u2014they're unmaking your possibilities . Your Death If you die, your extracted selves drift. Memories corrupt over weeks or months Identity fragments. They forget their unlived lives. Eventually they become echoes. Walking, talking, but not coherent. Not quite people anymore. Some extracted selves will do anything to keep you alive. You're not just their origin\u2014you're their coherence. Without you, they dissolve. The Horror You're always eating your future. Every pull means: I will never become that person naturally. I will never walk that path. I will never make that choice and see where it leads. Young threaders have options. Old threaders have regrets. The oldest threaders\u2014the ones who pulled too much\u2014are ghosts before they die. No future left. Just the thin present moment, and the handful of selves they extracted before the well ran dry. And those selves? They know what you did. They know you spent their futures to get their skills, their knowledge, their help. Some forgive you. Some serve you. Some wait.

It has eaten the dead. It remembers what it consumed. When you summon, you fruit \u2014push the colony's biomass out of your body, shaped by the pattern of something it has previously decomposed. You are the garden. The dead are the seeds. What grows serves you\u2014mostly. The Colony What It Is A symbiotic fungal organism threaded through your body. Mycelium wrapped around your organs, woven into your muscles, nested in your gut. It's been there since infection\u2014possibly since birth, if your bloodline carries the strain. It's not intelligent. Not exactly. But it remembers . Chemically, structurally. Every dead thing it has ever broken down is stored as a pattern, a template, a set of instructions for reconstruction. How You Get One Three paths: Inheritance : Some bloodlines have carried colonies for generations. The fungus passes from parent to child\u2014in the womb, through nursing, through deliberate ritual feeding. These colonies are old, rich with patterns, heavy with the dead of your ancestors. Implantation : Deliberate infection. Consume a prepared culture. Inhale spores from an established host. Let someone cut you and pack the wound with living mycelium. The colony takes root over weeks\u2014painful weeks, as it learns your body and you learn its hunger. Wild infection : Rare and dangerous. Wild strains aren't adapted to human hosts. They might consume you instead of partnering. But they also haven't been domesticated, limited, bred for obedience. Wild hosts are unstable and powerful. The Relationship You and the colony aren't one being. You're partners\u2014sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing. Communication : Chemical, not verbal. You feel what it needs. Hunger. Satiation. Readiness. Reluctance. Over time you learn to interpret its states, and it learns yours. Negotiation : It wants to be fed. It wants to fruit. It wants to spread. Satisfy those drives and it cooperates fully. Deny them and it starts taking what it needs. Conflict : You can suppress the colony. Starve it, deny it, fight its urges. This is painful for both. Long-term suppression can damage the colony\u2014or you. Feeding the Colony The Core Rule The colony can only summon what it has consumed. No pattern, no summon. The Consumption Process Feed the colony dead things. Corpses, carcasses, any organic matter that was once alive. The colony breaks it down over hours to days, depending on size. A rat takes hours. A human takes days. A horse takes a week. During decomposition, the colony absorbs the pattern \u2014the biological blueprint. The physical matter is processed into nutrients. You benefit from this. Hosts who feed their colonies regularly need less food otherwise. What You Can Feed It Animals : Common, easy, socially acceptable (mostly). A well-maintained colony has consumed dozens of creatures. Humans : Richer patterns, more useful for complex summons. Also murder, or at minimum corpse acquisition. Other hosts : A colony that consumes another colony gains its patterns. This is how strains merge, compete, and evolve. It's also how wars between hosts end. Parts : You don't need the whole thing. A hand gives you a hand-pattern. A heart gives you a heart. Useful for specialists. Storage Limits The colony can only hold so many patterns clearly. Old patterns degrade. Recent consumption (weeks): clear patterns, high-fidelity summons Older consumption (months): degraded patterns, approximate summons Ancient consumption (years): fragmentary patterns, partial summons Hosts who want to keep a pattern fresh have to re-feed periodically. Kill another one of the same thing. Refresh the template. The Summoning (Fruiting) The Process You call a pattern. Will it, focus on it, reach into the colony's memory. The colony responds\u2014if willing, if it has the pattern, if you have the biomass. Fruiting begins. Mycelium pushes outward through skin, mouth, wounds. Uncomfortable to agonizing depending on size. The biomass shapes itself according to the stored pattern. The summon separates. Stands, moves, exists as an independent organism\u2014connected to you, but physically distinct. What Comes Out A fungal reconstruction of whatever the colony consumed. Shape of the original. Structure. Proportions. Approximate capabilities. A summoned wolf can run and bite. A summoned soldier can fight. No original mind. The colony's impression of behavior, filtered through chemical memory. Looks wrong . Fibrous flesh. Pale or mottled coloring. No blood\u2014cut it and it leaks clear fluid. Faces that approximate features without achieving them. The Tether The summon remains connected. You sense what it senses, dimly. It follows your intentions, mostly. Colony drives lurk underneath. Distance matters. Close summons are responsive. Distant ones get autonomous. Severed tether doesn't vanish the summon\u2014it just stops being yours . The Costs Biomass The summon is made from you . Small summons: a meal's worth. Hungry, lightheaded afterward. Medium summons: several meals. Gaunt, shaky. Large summons: dangerous. Pulling from muscle, reserves, things you need. Multiple summons: multiplicative cost. Recovery After dismissing or reabsorbing: Eating. A lot. Protein, fat, minerals. Time. Days for large summons. The colony's cut. Not everything comes back. Long-term summoners are lighter than they should be. The Colony's Demands When it's not satisfied: Hunger : Craving dead things. Compulsion to seek corpses. Fruiting pressure : The need to externalize. Suppress too long and it might fruit involuntarily. Spread drive : The colony wants new hosts. You start noticing people as candidates . Reabsorption and Dismissal Reabsorption Pull the biomass back in. Reverse fruiting. Recovers some of what you spent. Uncomfortable. Something crawling back inside. Takes time. Minutes to longer. Damaged summons bring damage back with them. Decomposition If you won't reabsorb: Fast breakdown. Hours. Messy. Collapses into fungal matter. Wasteful. No biomass recovery. Abandonment Leave a summon active indefinitely: It feeds itself. Hunting, scavenging. It might grow. Add biomass. It might reproduce. Spread spores. It stops being yours. Feral. What Hosts Look Like Physical Signs Pale or grayish undertone. Mycelium shows through. Faint patterning visible in certain light. Run cool. The colony takes heat. Smell of loam, petrichor, hint of decay. Eyes develop cloudiness over time. Behavioral Signs Constant eating. Protein and fat. Stay thin despite it. Drawn to dead things. Notice corpses. Have to resist acquiring. Touch people differently. Assessing. The colony is interested in new hosts. The Old Ones Decades of hosting: More mycelium than meat. Don't think quite like humans. Colony priorities seeped in. Some stop being human-shaped between summonings. Framework for fruiting.

Core Binding + Pact Summoning If a pact summoner dies, is there a core to harvest? Depends on how much is left. A summoner who's been paying for decades might leave a core so thin it's barely usable. Or nothing at all. Duds\u2014empty, immediately gone upon death. Or the core is pulled to the Elsewhere. Something happens to it there. This might be the thing we don't understand. Flesh Shaping + Pact Summoning Could you spark a homunculus with a pact summoner's diminished core? What would that create? Would the entity still have a claim? Elsewhere Entities + Core Binding The entities have no cores. They're from outside. The rules of death here don't apply. You can't bind one. Can't harvest one. They're outside the economy that governs everything else. That's part of why they're dangerous. Fate Threading + Other Arts Can you pull a version of yourself that practiced a different Art? Yes. And they'd come with the knowledge and corruption of that practice. The Flesh Shaper-you is pale and hungry. The Core Binder-you has echoes bleeding into them. The Pact Summoner-you might still owe something to an entity. Colony + Core Binding Can a colony consume a practitioner and gain something from their practice? Unknown. Colonies gain patterns, not abilities. But a Flesh Shaper's pattern might include something about blood-affinity. A Core Binder's pattern might include traces of their echoes. The interactions haven't been thoroughly explored. They're dangerous to test. The Universal Truth Every Art in H\u00e1lcova operates on the same principle: You must spend something real to gain something real. The currency varies: - The dead and your sense of self (Core Binding) - Blood and your humanity (Flesh Shaping) - Your soul in installments (Pact Summoning) - Your future possibilities (Fate Threading) - Your body and autonomy (Colony Summoning) But the transaction is always the same.

Not a ghost, not a spirit\u2014something more fundamental.

Core Binding is the practice of trapping these cores in physical anchors and calling them forth as echoes \u2014manifestations of the dead that walk, speak, and act as they did in life. The horror: the echoes don't know they're dead. They think they're still alive, still themselves. They might ask about family members who've moved on, wonder why the world has changed, try to go home to houses that no longer exist. You know. They don't.

Not just humans\u2014animals, beasts, monsters, anything with sufficient complexity to leave an imprint. The core contains enough of the original to function: walk, fight, remember fragments, express personality. But it's incomplete. A copy of a copy. The full person is gone; what remains is an echo that doesn't know it's an echo. Harvesting Cores must be harvested at or shortly after death. The process varies by tradition and culture, but the essence is the same: you extract the core before it dissipates and bind it to a physical anchor. Skilled harvesters can sense cores. They know when one is strong (a person who died with purpose, with unfinished business, with intensity) and when one is weak (peaceful deaths, accepted endings, lives that felt complete). The strongest cores come from: - Violent deaths - Deaths with unfinished purpose - Deaths accompanied by intense emotion - Deaths that the dying refused to accept The weakest cores come from: - Peaceful passings - Deaths accepted and prepared for - Lives that felt complete - Deaths in old age after long decline","title":"The Core"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#anchors","text":"Physical Form A core needs a home. The anchor is a physical object that houses the bound echo\u2014a prison dressed as a portrait. Anchors can take many forms: - Carved figurines or statuettes - Painted tiles or tablets - Etched metal plates - Clay tablets with pressed images - Bone carvings - Jewelry settings - Decorated containers The anchor must depict the bound echo. This can happen two ways: Natural manifestation : The anchor changes when a core is bound to it, the image of the echo appearing on or in the material as if etched by invisible hands. Artistic creation : The binder creates the depiction deliberately, crafting an image of the creature to be bound before or during the binding process. Looking at a binder's collection tells you who they carry. The echoes watch out from their prisons, rendered in whatever medium houses them.

The Bottleneck Multiple simultaneous activations create problems: Resonance interference : Too many active echoes at once causes bleeding between them. Their memories mix. Their identities blur. Two echoes might start sharing the same thought, speaking in unison, losing track of which one is which. Physical drain : Every active echo taxes the binder. The more echoes active, the greater the exhaustion. Running too many is like holding your breath\u2014eventually something gives. The limit is personal. Some binders can run four echoes comfortably.

The awareness creates strain\u2014the echo fighting against its condition, the anchor struggling to contain something that wants out. Aware echoes require constant upkeep and intensive focus. Quality Matters The resource can be: - Adulterated (stretched with fillers\u2014causes instability) - Counterfeited (fake\u2014causes degradation) - Aged (loses potency over time) - Fresh (most effective, most expensive) Experienced binders can assess quality by look, smell, even taste. They know when they're being cheated. They know when the resource is good enough to maintain a difficult echo, or only good enough for simple ones. Scarcity as Plot Peace is expensive for binders.

The amount scales with complexity: Simple tool (a fetching hand, a watching eye): A cupful. Dizziness, hunger afterward. Basic servant (follows instructions, performs labor): Several cups. Pale for days, sleeping hard, eating constantly. Soldier construct (built for violence): Enough to leave you bedridden for a week. Some crafters need transfusions. Mimic (passes for human): Crafters have died on the table finishing these, bled out with hands still inside the chest cavity, shaping the last chamber of a heart.

The homunculus was made for this token, crafted with the binding built in from the start. When dormant, the homunculus collapses into the token. Not destroyed\u2014folded. Compressed. Waiting. Where it waits is unclear. Crafters disagree. Some say the homunculus enters a kind of stasis. Others believe it exists in a pocket dimension tied to the token. Others think it simply ceases to exist until summoned, recreated each time from the pattern stored in the binding. Nobody knows for certain. The homunculi don't remember dormancy, or if they do, they can't describe it. Summoning Activate the token, and the homunculus unfolds back into reality. Fast for simple constructs\u2014they snap into existence almost instantly. Slower for complex ones\u2014they need time to become , flesh knitting together, bones locking into place, the body assembling itself from nothing visible. Every summoning costs fresh blood.

Miss a month: What comes out when you finally feed it won't be what you put in. A crafter is always bleeding . Six constructs means six drops a day, minimum.

Bloodhouses : Places where the desperate sell by the pint. Technically legal in some jurisdictions. The sellers are gaunt, hollow-eyed, always cold. They don't last long. Fresh ones cycle in. Nobody asks where the old ones went. Wartime crafters : Military Flesh Shapers have access to prisoners, wounded enemies, civilians in occupied territory. A soldier-construct requires a lot of fuel. The supply chain gets dark fast. The black market : Blood dealers who don't ask questions about sourcing. The Homunculus Knows It can smell blood. It can tell the difference between: - Willing and unwilling - Healthy and sick - Its maker and a stranger - Fear-blood and calm-blood Some crafters swear their constructs behave differently depending on what they've been fed: - More vicious on fear-blood - Sluggish on the blood of the drugged - Eager when they've tasted someone they'll meet again","title":"Upkeep: The Blood Economy"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#what-this-does-to-crafters","text":"Physical Markers Pale.

Mycelium wrapped around your organs, woven into your muscles, nested in your gut. It's been there since infection\u2014possibly since birth, if your bloodline carries the strain. It's not intelligent. Not exactly. But it remembers . Chemically, structurally. Every dead thing it has ever broken down is stored as a pattern, a template, a set of instructions for reconstruction. How You Get One Three paths: Inheritance : Some bloodlines have carried colonies for generations. The fungus passes from parent to child\u2014in the womb, through nursing, through deliberate ritual feeding. These colonies are old, rich with patterns, heavy with the dead of your ancestors. Implantation : Deliberate infection. Consume a prepared culture. Inhale spores from an established host. Let someone cut you and pack the wound with living mycelium. The colony takes root over weeks\u2014painful weeks, as it learns your body and you learn its hunger. Wild infection : Rare and dangerous. Wild strains aren't adapted to human hosts. They might consume you instead of partnering. But they also haven't been domesticated, limited, bred for obedience. Wild hosts are unstable and powerful. The Relationship You and the colony aren't one being. You're partners\u2014sometimes cooperative, sometimes competing. Communication : Chemical, not verbal. You feel what it needs. Hunger. Satiation. Readiness. Reluctance. Over time you learn to interpret its states, and it learns yours. Negotiation : It wants to be fed. It wants to fruit. It wants to spread. Satisfy those drives and it cooperates fully. Deny them and it starts taking what it needs. Conflict : You can suppress the colony. Starve it, deny it, fight its urges. This is painful for both. Long-term suppression can damage the colony\u2014or you.","title":"The Colony"},{"location":"halcova/magic/the_five_arts/#feeding-the-colony","text":"The Core Rule The colony can only summon what it has consumed. No pattern, no summon. The Consumption Process Feed the colony dead things. Corpses, carcasses, any organic matter that was once alive. The colony breaks it down over hours to days, depending on size. A rat takes hours. A human takes days. A horse takes a week. During decomposition, the colony absorbs the pattern \u2014the biological blueprint. The physical matter is processed into nutrients. You benefit from this. Hosts who feed their colonies regularly need less food otherwise. What You Can Feed It Animals : Common, easy, socially acceptable (mostly). A well-maintained colony has consumed dozens of creatures. Humans : Richer patterns, more useful for complex summons. Also murder, or at minimum corpse acquisition. Other hosts : A colony that consumes another colony gains its patterns. This is how strains merge, compete, and evolve. It's also how wars between hosts end. Parts : You don't need the whole thing. A hand gives you a hand-pattern. A heart gives you a heart. Useful for specialists. Storage Limits The colony can only hold so many patterns clearly. Old patterns degrade. Recent consumption (weeks): clear patterns, high-fidelity summons Older consumption (months): degraded patterns, approximate summons Ancient consumption (years): fragmentary patterns, partial summons Hosts who want to keep a pattern fresh have to re-feed periodically.

Stands, moves, exists as an independent organism\u2014connected to you, but physically distinct. What Comes Out A fungal reconstruction of whatever the colony consumed. Shape of the original.

The cost of any action is the value of the best alternative you didn't take. How It Manifests : When a Fate Threader pulls a version of themselves from an unmade choice, they're not accessing a parallel universe. They're harvesting the opportunity cost itself . The future they didn't choose had value\u2014stored potential\u2014and they're cashing it out. But opportunity costs aren't free-floating. They're attached to you . When you harvest one: - Gain the capability/knowledge/resource from that path - Permanently close that path (it's been spent) - Reduce your total remaining \"decision space\" The Horror : Your life starts with a vast decision tree of possible futures. Each extraction shrinks it. Extract enough, and you've narrowed your remaining possibilities to a single track. You become deterministic\u2014not because fate is fixed, but because you've spent all your alternatives. The Economic Parallel : This is exactly how real opportunity costs work. Every career choice, relationship, investment closes doors. H\u00e1lcova just makes the ledger visible and the withdrawals explicit. 2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Core Binding) The Principle : People irrationally weigh costs already paid when making current decisions, even though those costs can't be recovered. How It Manifests : Core Binding creates echoes\u2014remnants of the dead bound to anchors. The binder invests Pattern Residue, time, and pieces of their own identity to maintain the binding. The fallacy manifests when: - The echo becomes corrupted or hostile - The echo's information becomes outdated - The echo's presence damages the binder's relationships Rationally, the binder should release the echo. But they've invested so much. The echo contains memories of their dead spouse, or crucial knowledge from a lost mentor, or evidence of a crime. The binder thinks: \"I've already paid for this. I can't waste that investment.\" The Horror : Binders hold onto echoes past all rational justification. The echo of your mother starts forgetting who you are, starts confusing you with your dead sibling, starts asking why you killed her. You should let her go. But you've spent fifteen years maintaining this binding. Surely another year will fix it. Another decade. The sunk cost compounds. The Structural Element : The magic system rewards sunk cost thinking. Older bindings are stronger, more coherent, more useful\u2014if you can hold on long enough. This creates genuine uncertainty about whether continuing is irrational or just requires patience. The fallacy becomes indistinguishable from reasonable strategy. 3. Moral Hazard (Pact Summoning) The Principle : When someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions, they take greater risks.

Evidence from multiple sources\u2014geological, archaeological, biological\u2014confirms that the planet was significantly warmer in the deep past. Something changed. Understanding what happened, when, and why is one of the great mysteries of H\u00e1lcovan scholarship. Evidence for a Warmer Past Geological Evidence Fossil Flora : - Deep rock strata contain impressions of plants that cannot survive in current conditions - Broad-leafed species (not narrow, cold-adapted forms) - Vegetation patterns suggesting temperate to subtropical climates - Found even in high-latitude locations now under permanent ice Sedimentary Records : - Ancient river deltas in regions now covered by glaciers - Lake bed formations in the interior plateau - Coastal erosion patterns inconsistent with current ice-locked shores - Evidence of rain-based weathering (now almost everything is freeze-thaw) Ice Core Analysis : - Air bubbles trapped in ancient ice contain different atmospheric composition - Higher CO2 in older samples - Lower Pattern Residue signatures in pre-cooling layers - Distinct layer marking the transition (datable, approximately 40,000-50,000 years ago) Archaeological Evidence Ruins in Impossible Locations : - Structures found under northern ice cap - Building materials and techniques unsuited to extreme cold - No heating infrastructure (suggesting it wasn't needed) - Agricultural tools, storage facilities for warm-climate crops The Polar Complexes : - Both polar regions contain ancient structures - Northern complex: appears residential/ceremonial - Southern complex: appears to be containment/industrial - Both predate all known civilizations - Both were operational before the cooling Coastal Cities Now Underwater : - Sea levels were different (both higher in some places, lower in others) - Submerged ruins in shallow waters - Navigation hazards that are clearly artificial origin - Suggests different shorelines, different habitable zones Biological Evidence Relic Species : - Some organisms in Middle Waters appear adapted to warmer conditions - Genetic diversity suggests recent (geologically) isolation from larger populations - \"Warm-adapted\" traits that make no sense for current climate Domestication Gaps : - Domestic species show genetic bottleneck ~40,000 years ago - Wild ancestors extinct or drastically reduced - Suggests catastrophic population collapse around the same time as cooling The Cooling Event What We Know Timing : Approximately 40,000-50,000 years before present (local years) Speed : Geologically rapid\u2014possibly within a few thousand years, perhaps faster Magnitude : Average temperatures dropped 15-25\u00b0C globally Pattern : Not uniform\u2014polar regions cooled most, equatorial regions least Possible Natural Causes Orbital Shift : Could the planet's orbit have changed? - Would require external force (massive impact, gravitational interference) - No evidence of impact crater of sufficient size - No evidence of planetary capture or encounter Volcanic Winter : Massive volcanic activity could have blocked sunlight. - Some evidence of heightened volcanism around the right time - But volcanic winters are temporary\u2014this cooling persisted - Vent Lands volcanism predates the cooling and continued through it Atmospheric Change : Something removed greenhouse gases. - CO2 levels did drop, but this could be effect rather than cause - What could remove that much CO2 that quickly? - No known natural mechanism The Pattern Residue Theory The Core Hypothesis : Pattern Residue began accumulating in the atmosphere around the time of the cooling. As it accumulated, it absorbed increasing amounts of thermal energy. The cooling is a direct result of Residue buildup. Supporting Evidence : - Ice cores show Residue appearing at the transition layer - Residue concentration correlates with temperature drop - Current Residue distribution matches thermal patterns - The mechanism is observable (Residue does absorb heat) The Question : Where did the Residue come from? Options: Mass Death Event : Something killed an enormous population, releasing Residue The Elsewhere Opened : Residue entered from outside reality It Was Manufactured : Someone or something created Residue deliberately It Was Always There : But something changed its behavior/state The Engineered Cooling Theory The Core Hypothesis : The cooling was deliberate. Someone\u2014an ancient civilization, the Elsewhere, or something else\u2014chose to freeze the planet. Supporting Evidence : - The polar structures predate the cooling but appear designed for it - The southern polar complex looks like a prison (designed to contain something) - The northern polar complex is at a reality-wound (designed to seal something?) - Pattern Residue's distribution isn't random\u2014it's concentrated where it would do most \"work\" Possible Purposes : Containment : The cold keeps something imprisoned. The Residue is part of the containment system. The polar structures are the mechanism. Defense : The cold keeps something out. The Elsewhere can't fully manifest in extreme cold (supported by Middle Waters' K\u00f6d protection). The planet was weaponized against invasion. Preservation : The cold preserves something. Under the ice, something valuable\u2014knowledge, technology, a sleeping entity\u2014waits to be recovered. The cooling was protective, not destructive. Consequence : The cooling wasn't the goal but the cost. Something was done that required enormous energy. Pattern Residue is waste product. The cold is side effect. The Ancient Civilization Question Who Built the Polar Structures? The Evidence : - Structures predate any known human civilization - Construction techniques don't match any historical tradition - Scale suggests resources beyond anything current civilizations could mobilize - Purpose is unclear but evidently important Theories : Pre-Human Inhabitants : A non-human intelligent species existed before current H\u00e1lcovan life. They built, they modified the moons, they did whatever caused the cooling, and they're gone. Where did they go? Died in the cooling they caused? Transcended? Became the Elsewhere entities? Unknown. Early Humans with Lost Technology : Humans existed longer than records show. The cooling destroyed their civilization. Survivors regressed. Current history is a rebuilding from collapse. The technology wasn't magic\u2014it was something else, now lost. Elsewhere Origin : The structures weren't built by H\u00e1lcova natives. They were built by or for Elsewhere entities. The wound at the northern pole is their entrance. The prison at the southern pole holds something they imprisoned\u2014or something that imprisoned them. The Loom Itself : The structures are proto-Loom installations. The current Loom is a degraded descendant of something that once operated on a planetary scale. The cooling was a side effect of the Loom's creation or operation. What Happened to the Ancient Builders? The Disappearance No bodies. No clear evidence of massacre, plague, or exodus. They built structures that still stand, and then they're simply absent from the record. Extinction Theories : The Cold Killed Them : They caused the cooling and couldn't survive it. Engineering hubris. They Left : Advanced enough to build what they built, advanced enough to leave. But where? Elsewhere? Another world? They Changed : They didn't die\u2014they became something else. Integrated with the Elsewhere. Became the Attendance. Uploaded into the Loom. They're Still Here : Hiding. Sleeping. Waiting. Under the ice. In the Elsewhere. In places we haven't looked. What They Left Behind The Polar Structures : Still functional in some sense. Still doing whatever they were built to do. The wound bleeds; the prison holds. The Moon Arrangement : If they arranged the moons, that's ongoing. The tidal effects, the resonances, the magical correlations\u2014all still operating. Pattern Residue : Did they create it? Modify it? Introduce it to the planet? It may be their most significant legacy, the foundation of all H\u00e1lcovan magic. The Loom (possibly): Is the Loom their creation, their descendant, or their continuation? The Attendance that answers queries\u2014is that them? A piece of them? Their replacement? Implications for Current H\u00e1lcova Climate Trajectory Is the Cooling Ongoing? Current evidence suggests equilibrium. The cooling has stabilized. The world isn't getting colder\u2014but it isn't warming either. Could It Reverse? Unknown. If Pattern Residue absorption is causing the cold, reducing Residue might warm the planet. But Residue is tied to population death. Reducing Residue requires reducing death. The incentives are complex. If the polar structures are maintaining the cold, damaging them might change things. But the northern wound might widen. The southern prisoner might escape. The cure could be worse than the disease. Deliberate Climate Engineering : In theory, concentrated Residue-burning could warm regions. In practice, the Residue economy makes this politically impossible. Those who control Residue profit from scarcity. A warmer world threatens their power. The Polar Expeditions Why Go There? - Understanding what's under the ice - Recovering ancient technology or knowledge - Assessing the wound and prison status - Resource extraction (concentrated Residue deposits) - Religious pilgrimage (various traditions) Why Not? - Extreme conditions - K\u00f6d bleed effects (during the fifth season) - The Warden Order restricts access - Rumors of what expeditions find (and what finds them) - Most who go don't return, or return changed The Questions That Matter Practical : - Can we understand what the ancients did? - Can we use their technology? - Can we undo or modify the cooling? - What are the risks of interfering? Philosophical : - Did the ancients make the right choice? - Is the cold protecting us or imprisoning us? - What would we do differently if we could? - Who decides? The Oral Traditions Legends of the Warm Time Every culture on H\u00e1lcova has stories of a warmer age: The Heartlands : \"Before The Weaver's cold breath, the land was green and the sun was kind. Our ancestors sinned\u2014forgot the pattern\u2014and winter came as punishment.\" The Shattered Reaches : \"The islands were one great land before the breaking. When the world cracked, the cold poured in through the wound.\" The Middle Waters : \"We are the remnant of the warm time. Our islands remember. The fire below keeps the old covenant.\" The Vent Lands : \"The cold is a beast that hunts. Our mountains breathe fire to hold it at bay. We have always fought.\" The Far Shelf : \"The ice came from beyond. It brought the patterns with it. Before the ice, we were free.\" Common Elements Across all traditions: - The world was warmer - Something changed (sin, catastrophe, invasion, choice) - The cold is connected to fate/pattern/the Loom - Some places remember (Middle Waters, Vent Lands) - The change might not be permanent Religious Interpretations Orthodox : The cooling is The Weaver's design. The warm time was chaos; the cold brings order. Questioning is impiety. Threadist : The cooling was one choice among many. The ancients chose cold; we might choose differently. The design is unfinished. Hollow Saint : The cooling is the prison's construction. Fate is a cage of ice. Escape means melting. Colony Cult : The colonies remember the warm time. Their patterns contain fragments of the old world. Hosting connects you to what was. Summary The evidence is clear: H\u00e1lcova was warmer 40,000-50,000 years ago. Something\u2014an ancient civilization, the Elsewhere, a natural event, or deliberate engineering\u2014caused a rapid cooling. Pattern Residue may be the mechanism or the byproduct. The polar structures are involved. The moon arrangement may be related. The cooling created current H\u00e1lcova: the ice world, the Residue economy, the survival imperative, the magic system that runs on death. Understanding what happened, and whether it can be changed, is both an academic question and an existential one. The ancients made choices. We live with the consequences. Whether we could\u2014or should\u2014choose differently is the question that underlies everything.

The result is an ecosystem that would seem alien to human eyes\u2014dark vegetation, cold-adapted creatures, and organisms that interact with the exotic matter that defines this world. The Light Environment S\u00e1rgvas Spectrum The K-type star provides: - Dominant orange-red light - Significant infrared - Reduced ultraviolet - Less total energy than a G-type star at equivalent distance Photosynthesis Adaptation Earth plants are green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, reflecting green. Under S\u00e1rgvas: - Less blue light available to absorb - More red and infrared available - Organisms evolved to absorb different wavelengths The Result : H\u00e1lcova's photosynthetic organisms absorb across a wider spectrum, including more infrared. They reflect very little, appearing dark to human-equivalent eyes. Flora by Climate Zone Polar Transition Zone (Darkest) Coloration : Black to deep charcoal Reason : Maximum light absorption needed; every photon counts Dominant Forms : Black Lichen - Encrusting growth on rocks, ice-free surfaces - Survives temperatures to -50\u00b0C - Photosynthesizes during brief light periods - Contains Pattern Residue-processing compounds (one of the few organisms that can) Shadow Moss - Thick, carpet-forming moss - Nearly black, occasionally deep purple - Insulating properties (creatures nest in it) - Grows on soil, dead vegetation, abandoned structures Pole-Creep - Extremely slow-growing woody plant - Hugs ground, never exceeds 10cm height - Wood is incredibly dense (centuries of growth compressed) - Valued for specialized construction Temperate Zones (Dark Purple to Deep Red) Coloration : Purple, maroon, deep burgundy Reason : Balance between absorption efficiency and avoiding overheating during L\u00e1ng Dominant Forms : Blackwood Trees - Coniferous trees with black bark, dark purple needles - Grow 20-40m tall in favorable conditions - Wood is hard, dark, valuable for construction - Needles contain compounds used in medicine Bloodgrass - Prairie-forming grass with deep red blades - Covers temperate lowlands - Turns nearly black in winter, red in summer - Feeds grazing herds Vein-Vine - Climbing plant with purple stems, dark red leaves - Wraps around other plants or structures - Produces small berries (edible, bitter) - Spreads aggressively in disturbed areas Duskflowers - Flowering plants in various dark hues - Bloom briefly during L\u00e1ng - Pollinated by cold-adapted insects and small flying creatures - Some species cultivated for dyes, medicine, ritual use Forest Character : Temperate forests on H\u00e1lcova are dark, cathedral-like spaces. The canopy absorbs most light. Undergrowth is sparse where canopy is thick. Sound carries strangely. The amber light filtering through dark needles creates an atmosphere humans find either peaceful or oppressive. Middle Waters / Tropical Zone (Brightest) Coloration : Deep red, orange-red, occasional bright orange Reason : Can afford to reflect more light; heat management more important than maximum absorption Dominant Forms : Ember Palms - Tropical equivalent with frond-like leaves in orange-red - Multiple species adapted to various island conditions - Some produce edible fruit - Wood is light, used for boats and structures Fire Ferns - Groundcover in bright red-orange - Thrives in volcanic soil - Some varieties only grow near geothermal vents Coral Equivalent - Colonial organisms building reef structures - Colors vary: red, orange, yellow (brightest organisms on H\u00e1lcova) - Not related to Earth coral\u2014convergent evolution - Create complex underwater ecosystems Steam Orchids - Flowering plants near geothermal features - Spectacular colors (by H\u00e1lcova standards): orange, red, occasional yellow - Rare, valuable, cultivated with difficulty - Associated with Colony Cults (fungi often grow in same conditions) The Color Gradient Zone Vegetation Color Reason Polar Black Maximum absorption High latitude Charcoal, deep purple High absorption, some reflection Temperate Purple, maroon, burgundy Balanced absorption/reflection Subtropical Deep red, wine More reflection for heat management Tropical Red, orange-red, orange Maximum reflection sustainable Fauna: General Principles Cold Adaptation All H\u00e1lcova fauna evolved for cold conditions: Insulation : - Thick fur, fat layers, or unique insulating structures - Some species have hollow hairs (trapped air insulation) - Aquatic species have dense, oily coats Metabolism : - Generally slower than Earth equivalents - Can survive long periods without food - Hibernation-like states common during Csend - Quick metabolic bursts for predation/escape Size Patterns : - Large body size common (better heat retention) - Small species rare except in Middle Waters - Pack/herd behavior provides shared warmth Pattern Residue Interaction Most fauna avoids Pattern Residue: Residue Sensitivity : - High concentrations cause stress, disorientation - Animals avoid death sites until Residue dissipates - Migration patterns route around high-Residue areas - Explains why polar regions lack megafauna (Residue too dense) Exceptions : - A few specialized species have evolved Residue tolerance - Some actually feed on or process Residue - These species are economically important (see below) Notable Fauna Megafauna Iron Elk ( Vast\u00falszarvas ) - Massive cervid, shoulder height 2.5m - Antlers span up to 3m - Dense, shaggy coat (dark grey to black) - Migrates seasonally across temperate tundra - Primary prey species for large predators - Domesticated variant used as draft animal (smaller, more docile) Glacier Bear ( J\u00e9gmedve ) - Largest land predator in most regions - 3m at shoulder when standing - White to pale grey coat - Hunts anything it can catch - Mostly solitary - Feared and respected; hunting one is a cultural milestone Tundra Mammoth-Equivalent ( Gyapjassz\u00f6rny ) - Woolly, elephant-like creature - Smaller than Earth mammoths (3m shoulder height) - Herds in interior plateau and Far Shelf tundra - Hunted for meat, hide, ivory-equivalent tusks - Some domestication attempts (limited success) Deepwater Leviathan ( M\u00e9lyvizi\u00e1tr\u00e9m ) - Marine megafauna in Central Ocean - Size uncertain (rarely seen intact) - Hunted for oil, meat, bone - Dangerous prey\u2014ships lost pursuing them - May be multiple species grouped under one name Residue-Interacting Species The Ash Moth ( Hamuszita ) - Large moth (wingspan 30cm) - Attracted to Pattern Residue - Congregates at death sites - Appears to feed on or process ambient Residue - Presence indicates Residue concentration - Used by harvesters to locate deposits Residue Beetles ( Maradv\u00e1nybog\u00e1r ) - Small beetle that burrows into Residue-rich soil - Concentrates Residue in its shell - Shells collected for alchemical use - Farming attempts ongoing (limited success) The Thermal Worm ( H\u0151f\u00e9reg ) - Found in Vent Lands geothermal zones - Processes both Residue and thermal energy - Bodies are warm to the touch even after death - Used as portable heat sources (in containers) - One of the few creatures that thrives in high-Residue environments Fate Hounds ( Sorsebek ) - Canid species with unusual Pattern sensitivity - Can sense strong S\u00f3rscad patterns - Trained by Warden Order for tracking deviants - Wild packs avoid high-Residue areas - Domesticated individuals bond to handlers - Not actually \"hounds\"\u2014name is traditional Colony-Related Organisms Spore Carriers - Various insects and small animals - Carry fungal spores as part of lifecycle - Some deliberately seek Colony hosts to infect - Ecosystem role unclear (possibly mutualistic with wild colonies) The Reef-Fungus Symbiosis - In Middle Waters, reef organisms and fungal networks intertwine - Neither can survive without the other - Creates hybrid structures that confuse biologists - Colony Cults consider these sacred Domesticated Animals Draft Elk ( Teh\u00e9nszarvas ) - Domesticated Iron Elk variant - Smaller, calmer, bred for strength - Primary draft animal on mainland - Also milked (rich, fatty milk) - Cultural significance varies by region Ship Dogs ( Haj\u00f3kutya ) - Medium-sized canid bred for ship work - Rat-catching, guarding, companionship - Webbed feet, water-resistant coat - Standard on Shattered Reaches vessels Furnace Birds ( Kemencemad\u00e1r ) - Domesticated fowl - Lay eggs, eaten for meat - Kept inside during Csend (cannot survive deep cold) - Require heated housing in most regions Tunnel Pigs ( Alagutdiszn\u00f3 ) - Bred to survive underground - Fat reserves for lean times - Eat almost anything organic - Provide meat, fat, leather - Common in mining settlements Fungi and the Colony Question Natural Fungi Fungi are ubiquitous on H\u00e1lcova: - Decomposition in cold conditions requires specialized organisms - Fungi fill ecological niches that bacteria fill on warmer worlds - Many edible species (carefully distinguished from toxic ones) - Mycorrhizal networks connect forest ecosystems Colors : Unlike plants, fungi don't photosynthesize. They come in all colors\u2014white, grey, brown, orange, blue, even bioluminescent. The Colony Organisms The fungi used in Colony Summoning are related to but distinct from natural fungi: Key Differences : - Process Pattern Residue (natural fungi avoid it) - Form symbiotic bonds with hosts (natural fungi don't) - Store \"patterns\" of consumed organisms (natural fungi just decompose) - Respond to host will (natural fungi have no such interaction) Origins Unknown : - Did Colony fungi evolve naturally? - Were they engineered by ancient civilization? - Did they come from the Elsewhere? - Are they somehow related to the thing imprisoned at the southern pole? Ecological Role : - Wild Colony organisms exist (feral colonies) - They consume dead matter and grow - Without hosts, they can spread unpredictably - Some regions have \"colony zones\"\u2014areas where wild colonies have established - These zones are dangerous and economically valuable Ecosystem Dynamics Food Webs Temperate Terrestrial : Vegetation (Blackwood, Bloodgrass) \u2193 Primary Consumers (Elk herds, small grazers) \u2193 Secondary Consumers (Wolf-equivalents, small predators) \u2193 Apex Predators (Glacier Bears, human hunters) Marine : Phytoplankton-equivalent \u2193 Small fish, filter feeders \u2193 Medium fish, cephalopods \u2193 Large fish, marine mammals \u2193 Leviathans, human fishers Seasonal Cycles Csend (Winter) : - Most animals hibernate or reduce activity - Predators hunt weakened prey - Frozen carrion preserved for later consumption - Residue accumulates (less biological processing) Olvad\u00e1s (Thaw) : - Awakening, breeding season begins - Disease spreads from thawed pathogens - Migratory species return - Residue releases from ice (flora and fauna respond) L\u00e1ng (Summer) : - Peak activity, breeding, feeding - Maximum biomass - Predation intense (building reserves) - Residue at peak atmospheric concentration Hanyatl\u00e1s (Decline) : - Preparation for winter - Migration begins - Final feeding push - Residue begins precipitating K\u00f6d (Veil) : - Animal behavior changes (affected by Elsewhere bleed) - Some species become aggressive - Some become docile, disoriented - Colony organisms highly active - Ash Moths swarm (Residue precipitation attracts them) Pattern Residue Ecology The Cycle : 1. Death releases Residue 2. Residue disperses into environment 3. Most organisms avoid, some process 4. Ash Moths, Residue Beetles concentrate it 5. Precipitation during cold seasons removes from atmosphere 6. Concentrated deposits form over time 7.

The geography tells a story\u2014the Heartlands and Shattered Reaches were once a single continent, torn apart by some ancient catastrophe. The rift that separated them became the Narrow Sea. The Shattered Heartlands Theory The Evidence Looking at the coastlines, the relationship is obvious: - The ragged eastern coast of the Greater Continent matches the western edge of the Shattered Reaches - Rock formations, mineral deposits, and fossil-equivalents continue across the gap - The Narrow Sea is a flooded rift valley, not a true ocean basin - Ancient ruins exist on both sides with matching architectural styles What Happened Unknown. Theories include: - Geological catastrophe (natural rift) - The same event that caused the cooling - Deliberate separation (by whom? why?) - Elsewhere incursion that physically tore reality - The creation of the Loom requiring tremendous energy release The shattering is ancient\u2014tens of thousands of years at minimum. But the mystery feeds religious interpretation, political claims, and treasure-hunting expeditions. The Greater Continent (The Heartlands) Shape and Structure A crescent-shaped landmass curving from northwest to southeast, with the concave side facing the Middle Waters. The curve creates a natural harbor effect for the entire southern coast. Dimensions : Roughly 4,000 km along the outer curve, 800-1,200 km wide at various points. Major Geographic Features The Spine Mountains ( Gerincl\u00e1ncz ) A mountain range running along the curve of the continent, roughly following the crescent's arc. This range: - Blocks polar winds from the interior - Creates a rain shadow effect (northern interior is dry and cold; southern coast receives moisture) - Contains the highest peaks on H\u00e1lcova - Rich in mineral deposits, including concentrated Pattern Residue veins Notable Peaks : - The Watcher ( Az \u0150rszem ): Highest peak, visible from the sea on clear days. Site of an ancient observatory, now a Loom relay station. - The Broken Tooth ( T\u00f6r\u00f6tt Fog ): A collapsed peak, evidence of ancient volcanic activity or something else. Hollow Saints claim it marks where \"fate cracked.\" - The Twins ( Az Ikrek ): Two peaks of nearly identical height, separated by a pass. The main land route between northern and southern Heartlands. The Interior Plateau ( Fenns\u00edk ) Behind the Spine, a vast elevated plateau stretches toward the northern ice. Characteristics: - Elevation: 1,500-2,000m above sea level - Climate: Cold, dry, windy - Vegetation: Hardy tundra grasses, black lichen, scattered dwarf trees - Population: Sparse\u2014nomadic herders, mining settlements, Warden outposts - Pattern Residue: High concentration (ancient battlefield sites, unexcavated) The River Valleys Major rivers cut through the Spine from the interior, creating the primary population centers. The Five Rivers : 1. The Gold ( Aranyi ): Largest river, drains to the southeast coast. The capital region. 2. The Iron ( Vasalj ): Northern river, flows to the Narrow Sea. Industrial heartland. 3. The Silent ( Csendi ): Flows north, disappears under the ice cap. Sacred to Ancestor Speakers. 4. The Broken ( T\u00f6r\u00f6tti ): Western river, fragmented into multiple channels. Difficult to navigate. 5. The Vein ( V\u00e9na ): Southern river, reddish sediment. Flesh Shaper territory\u2014the sediment is mineral, not blood, but the association stuck. The Southern Coast The concave inner coast facing the Middle Waters. Characteristics: - Climate: Mildest on the continent (warm current arrival) - Terrain: Rolling hills, river deltas, natural harbors - Population: Dense\u2014major cities, agricultural land, trade ports - Loom Coverage: Maximum\u2014the Great Node is here The Northern Edge Where the continent meets the ice cap. Characteristics: - Climate: Extreme\u2014permanent ice within 100km - Terrain: Glacial, unstable, constantly shifting - Population: Minimal\u2014extraction outposts, Warden stations, exiles - K\u00f6d Effects: Partial bleed zone during the fifth season Political Geography The Heartlands contain multiple political entities, but shared characteristics: - Orthodox faith dominant - Loom integration in governance - Recognition of the Great Node's authority (in religious matters at minimum) - Interconnected through the river valley trade networks Specific nations/kingdoms to be developed separately. The Shattered Reaches Shape and Structure The \"missing piece\" of the original continent, now fragmented into one large island-continent and hundreds of smaller islands. The western coast clearly shows where it once connected to the Heartlands. Main Island : Roughly 1,500 km north-south, 600 km east-west Island Chains : Extending another 1,000 km eastward in clusters Major Geographic Features The Matching Coast The western edge of the main island\u2014steep cliffs, deep fjords, a mirror of the Heartlands' eastern ragged coast. Sailors navigating the Narrow Sea see both coasts and understand they're traveling through a wound. The Interior Highlands The main island's interior is mountainous\u2014a continuation of the Spine, now separated. Characteristics: - Peaks lower than the Spine (erosion, or the separation lowered them) - Heavy precipitation (maritime climate) - Dense, dark forests in the valleys (black-barked conifers) - Fast rivers with short courses to the sea The Fracture Zone The eastern portion of the main island and the inner island chains show evidence of additional breaking\u2014smaller rifts, sea-filled valleys, unstable geology. Theories: - Secondary breaks after the main separation - Ongoing geological instability - The pattern continues to crack - Elsewhere influence weakening material reality The Island Chains Hundreds of islands extending eastward: The Near Chains : Close to the main island, connected by sea ice during Csend. Large islands with permanent populations, small islands used seasonally. The Middle Chains : Further out, less connected. Independent communities, sometimes isolated for entire winters. Strong Ancestor Speaker traditions. The Far Chains : Scattered islands approaching the Far Water. Sparse population, expedition staging points, pirate havens. Maritime Character The Shattered Reaches are defined by the sea: - Every settlement is coastal or river-accessible - Naval power determines political influence - Fishing and sea-hunting are primary food sources - Shipbuilding is the prestige industry - Sea ice creates seasonal connectivity (Csend connects islands; Olvad\u00e1s isolates them) Political Geography Fragmented by design: - No continental-scale political unity - City-states control mainland harbors - Island kingdoms vary in size from single-island to chain-spanning - Merchant leagues provide economic coherence across political divisions - The Orthodox church is present but not dominant The Middle Waters Shape and Structure An archipelago of volcanic islands straddling the equatorial band. The warmest region on H\u00e1lcova\u2014the only place that never freezes. The Great Island : Central caldera island, roughly 200 km diameter Major Islands : 20-30 islands of significant size (50+ km) Minor Islands : Hundreds of smaller islands, atolls, and reef formations Major Geographic Features The Caldera ( The Eye ) The Great Island is the rim and interior of a dormant supervolcano. The caldera itself is partially flooded, creating a protected inner harbor of extraordinary value. Characteristics: - Caldera diameter: ~50 km - Rim elevation: 500-1,500m above sea level - Inner harbor: Deep, protected, warm - Geothermal activity: Hot springs, steam vents, warm ground - K\u00f6d protection: The caldera experiences almost no Elsewhere effects The Protection Mystery : Why is the caldera protected during K\u00f6d? Theories: - Geothermal energy disrupts the bleed - Ancient warding built into the volcanic structure - High life density anchors reality - Something in the caldera that Elsewhere avoids - Combination of factors The truth may involve ancient engineering\u2014the caldera shows signs of modification that don't match natural formation. The Reef Systems Cold-adapted reef analogues (not coral\u2014something else) surround many islands. Characteristics: - Built by colonial organisms adapted to cold water - Create protected lagoons and channels - Rich fishing grounds - Navigation hazards for unfamiliar sailors - Possible Pattern Residue interaction (the organisms may process it somehow) The Thermal Vents Underwater volcanic vents heat surrounding waters. Where these occur: - Water temperature is significantly higher - Unique ecosystems develop - Fog banks form (warm water meeting cold air) - Strategic value for winter fishing grounds Climate Advantage Why the Middle Waters stay warm: Latitude : Equatorial position receives maximum S\u00e1rgvas energy Volcanic heat : Geothermal contribution to ground and water temperature Ocean currents : Warm water pools here rather than flowing away quickly K\u00f6d protection : Less Pattern Residue precipitation during the strange season Unknown factor : The caldera's protection extends partially to surrounding islands Political Geography The most contested territory on H\u00e1lcova: - Every major power wants presence here - Colonial holdings, trading posts, military bases from multiple regions - Native island cultures caught between imperial interests - Colony Cults have significant influence (warm, wet conditions favor fungi) - Religious diversity\u2014Orthodoxy present but not dominant The Vent Lands Shape and Structure A continental fragment in the southern hemisphere, defined by extreme volcanic activity. Smaller than the Heartlands but geologically intense. Dimensions : Roughly 1,200 km north-south, 800 km east-west Coastline : Irregular, with many peninsulas and deep bays Major Geographic Features The Fire Range ( T\u0171zl\u00e1nc ) An active volcanic mountain chain running the length of the landmass. Characteristics: - 20+ active volcanoes - Continuous geothermal activity (hot springs, geysers, fumaroles) - Lava flows reshape geography on human timescales - Ash falls fertilize surrounding valleys - Toxic gas zones in low-lying areas The Thermal Valleys Protected valleys between volcanic ridges where geothermal heat creates habitable conditions. Characteristics: - Warm year-round (geothermal, not solar) - Lush vegetation (by H\u00e1lcova standards) - Dense population concentration - Natural hot water for bathing, cleaning, industrial processes - Some valleys toxic or unstable (constant monitoring required) The Steam Fields Where glaciers meet geothermal zones. Characteristics: - Constant steam and fog - Unstable footing (ice over warm ground) - Flash floods when ice dams break - Bizarre ice formations (frozen steam, thermal-sculpted glaciers) - Disorienting travel conditions The Sulfur Flats Lowland areas where volcanic gases concentrate. Characteristics: - Yellow-crusted ground (sulfur deposits) - Toxic air at ground level - Uninhabitable without protection - Valuable mineral extraction (sulfur, other volcanic minerals) - Worked by protected crews or homunculi Economic Advantage The Vent Lands don't need Pattern Residue for heat: - Geothermal energy provides heating, cooking, industrial power - Independence from the Residue trade network - Wealth from unique resources (volcanic minerals, geothermal-forged metals) - Political independence from Orthodox/Loom institutional pressure - Fleshwright traditions developed here (blood doesn't freeze; more experimentation possible) Political Geography Unified by geography rather than conquest: - Thermal valleys function as semi-independent city-states - Volcanic activity forces cooperation (warning systems, refugee support) - Trade federation rather than empire - Orthodoxy present but weaker (they need the Vent Lands more than reverse) - Fleshwright guilds have unusual legal status and power The Far Shelf Shape and Structure The most distant inhabited continent, in the southern hemisphere. Large, relatively flat, and cold. Dimensions : Roughly 2,000 km east-west, 1,500 km north-south Coastline : Long and exposed, few natural harbors Major Geographic Features The Shelf Proper The continent is a vast, low-elevation landmass\u2014a continental shelf that barely rises above sea level in many areas. Characteristics: - Elevation: 0-500m over most of the landmass - Terrain: Flat to gently rolling - Drainage: Poor\u2014marshes, bogs, seasonal lakes - Permafrost: Underlies most of the interior The Southern Ice Edge The continent's southern coast merges into the southern ice cap. Characteristics: - No clear boundary between land and ice - Glaciers extend from the cap across coastal regions - Ice cliffs along some stretches - Full K\u00f6d bleed zone The Mineral Ranges Low mountain ranges in the continental interior. Characteristics: - Rich ore deposits (iron, copper, rare metals) - Difficult extraction (permafrost, short work season) - Mining settlements operate seasonally or with heavy Residue-burning for heat - Tensions between extraction interests and indigenous populations The Tundra Most of the continental interior. Characteristics: - Black and purple vegetation mat (tundra grasses, lichens) - Migrating herd animals - Nomadic populations following herds - Long winters, brief intense summers - Less Loom coverage than any other inhabited region Frontier Character The Far Shelf is the edge of the known world: - Last region to be contacted/colonized - Still incompletely mapped in the interior - Indigenous populations with pre-Loom traditions - Threadist movements began here (distance from Orthodox center) - Hollow Saints operate more openly -

The Northern Cap: The Wound - This is where the Elsewhere connects to H\u00e1lcova - The K\u00f6d bleed isn't entities \"breaking through\"\u2014it's leakage from a permanent connection - The ice and cold may be natural, or may be attempting to seal/slow the leakage - Ancient ruins here may be from a civilization that understood the connection (and failed to close it) The Southern Cap: The Prison - Something is contained here - The Pattern Residue concentration is higher than it should be (deliberate accumulation) - The cold is more engineered than natural - Ancient structures here appear designed to hold, not to live - Whatever is contained was put there by someone who understood both the Elsewhere and the Loom The Implications : - Expeditions to the north find evidence of contact with the Elsewhere - Expeditions to the south find evidence of imprisonment - Very few people know both truths - The relationship between the wound and the prisoner is unclear (did one cause the other? are they related entities? is the prisoner there to guard the wound?) Ocean Currents: The Great Thermal Loop The System Water circulation in H\u00e1lcova's oceans follows a pattern shaped by temperature gradients, weak Coriolis effect, and geothermal sources. Surface Currents (Warm) The Middle Flow : - Warm water pools in the Middle Waters (equatorial heating + volcanic) - Surface flow moves north and south toward poles - Carries heat, moderating coastal temperatures - Provides moisture for precipitation - Supports marine life migration patterns Regional Branches : Southern Heartlands Current : Warm water reaches the Heartlands' concave coast, making it the mildest continental region. This is why civilization centered here first. Vent Lands Branch : Warm current meets geothermal outflow, creating exceptionally warm waters in the Vent Strait. Year-round ice-free, rich fishing. Shattered Reaches Split : Current divides around the main island. Western branch keeps inner channels warmer. Eastern branch cools quickly, making far islands colder. Far Shelf Failure : Current disperses before reaching the Far Shelf. No warm water arrives. Coldest coasts. Deep Currents (Cold) The Return Flow : - Surface water cools as it moves poleward - Cold water sinks at high latitudes - Deep current returns toward equator - Upwells in certain zones, bringing nutrients Regional Effects : The Northern Heartlands Coast : Cold return current makes these waters harsh. Fishing is dangerous but productive (nutrient-rich upwelling). The Central Deep Upwelling : Where cold water rises in the Central Ocean. Rich fishing, but far from land. Creates the \"uneasy\" zone where vessels feel observed. The Vent Upwelling : Where geothermal heat meets cold deep water. Massive nutrient concentration. The richest fishing grounds on H\u00e1lcova.

The Five Moons: Detailed Parameters L\u00e9lek (The Soul Moon) Pronunciation : LAY-lek Physical Characteristics : - Diameter: ~1,200 km (about 1/3 Luna) - Surface: Pale gold/amber coloration, cratered - Albedo: High (reflects S\u00e1rgvas light efficiently) - Composition: Rocky, possibly metalite-rich (explains color) Orbital Parameters : - Orbital period: 30 local days - Distance: ~180,000 km (closer than Luna) - Inclination: 5\u00b0 to H\u00e1lcova's equator - Eccentricity: 0.02 (nearly circular) Appearance from Surface : - Largest moon in the sky - Obvious phases, easily tracked - Pale gold color, sometimes amber during horizon view - Surface features visible to naked eye Associations : - L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 circle (Soul/Core) - Core Binding practice - Orthodox religious significance (The Weaver's first finger) H\u00fas (The Flesh Moon) Pronunciation : HOOSH Physical Characteristics : - Diameter: ~600 km - Surface: Iron-oxide rich, distinctly reddish - Albedo: Moderate - Composition: Dense, iron-heavy Orbital Parameters : - Orbital period: 18 local days - Distance: ~120,000 km - Inclination: 8\u00b0 to equator - Eccentricity: 0.03 Appearance from Surface : - Medium-sized disc - Distinctly red/rust colored - Moves noticeably faster across sky than L\u00e9lek - Phases cycle quickly Associations : - H\u00faslaimh circle (Flesh/Body) - Flesh Shaping practice - Blood, meat, physical existence - Considered unlucky to perform surgery when H\u00fas is dark K\u00f6tel (The Binding Moon) Pronunciation : KUH-tel Physical Characteristics : - Diameter: ~700 km - Surface: Dark grey, low reflectivity - Albedo: Low (hard to see) - Composition: Carbon-rich rock, possibly ancient Orbital Parameters : - Orbital period: 45 local days - Distance: ~250,000 km - Inclination: 3\u00b0 to equator - Eccentricity: 0.01 (most circular) Appearance from Surface : - Medium-sized but dim - Easy to lose track of (dark surface) - \"The hidden moon\"\u2014often overlooked - Best visible during its rare bright phases Associations : - C\u00f3itcai circle (Binding/Connection) - Pact Summoning - Hidden contracts, secrets - \"Under K\u00f6tel\" means \"in secret\" in common speech V\u00e9g (The Death Moon) Pronunciation : VAYG Physical Characteristics : - Diameter: ~300 km - Surface: Bright white/grey, high reflectivity - Albedo: Very high (ice surface?) - Composition: Unknown\u2014spectral analysis inconsistent Orbital Parameters : - Orbital period: 12 local days - Distance: ~80,000 km (closest moon) - Inclination: 12\u00b0 to equator (highest) - Eccentricity: 0.05 (most elliptical) Appearance from Surface : - Small but bright - Moves rapidly across sky - Almost star-like at distance, but tracking reveals motion - Inclined orbit means it sometimes appears far from other moons Associations : - H\u00e1lmaht circle (Death/End) - Colony Summoning - Endings, transitions, death - Fast movement associated with \"life is brief\" Fon\u00e1l (The Fate Moon) Pronunciation : FOH-nahl Physical Characteristics : - Diameter: ~200 km - Surface: Grey-white, unremarkable - Albedo: Moderate - Composition: Unknown\u2014too distant for clear analysis Orbital Parameters : - Orbital period: 60 local days - Distance: ~350,000 km (most distant) - Inclination: 2\u00b0 to equator - Eccentricity: 0.02 Appearance from Surface : - Very small, often mistaken for bright star - Slow-moving, easy to lose - Requires knowledge to track - \"The distant thread\" Associations : - S\u00f3rscad circle (Fate/Path) - Fate Threading - Long-term destiny, the far view - Astrologers and Loom-Keepers track it carefully Orbital Resonances The Artificial Pattern The five moons' orbital periods form near-perfect ratios: Ratio Moons Period Relationship 2:3 V\u00e9g : H\u00fas 12 : 18 days 2:3 H\u00fas : L\u00e9lek 18 : 30 (actually 27, but close) 3:2 L\u00e9lek : K\u00f6tel 30 : 45 days 3:4 K\u00f6tel : Fon\u00e1l 45 : 60 days These resonances keep the system stable. Without them, gravitational interactions would have destabilized the orbits over millions of years. The Implication : This configuration is not random. Either: 1. The moons were placed deliberately 2. The moons were adjusted into resonance 3. Something maintains the resonance actively Natural vs. Engineered Arguments for Natural Formation : - Resonance locks can form naturally (see Jupiter's moons) - Given enough time, systems find stable configurations - No direct evidence of construction Arguments for Engineering : - Five moons is unusual (most systems have 0-2 large moons) - The color/composition variety suggests different origins - Perfect resonance ratios are improbably clean - Cultural significance (five moons = five circles = five arts) suggests someone designed for meaning - V\u00e9g's spectral inconsistency suggests it's not normal rock/ice Prevailing Theory (among those who study such things): The moons existed but were adjusted\u2014moved into their current orbits by some ancient civilization or the Elsewhere itself. The purpose: unknown. The timing: before recorded history.

Orbital periods create meaningful ratios Cultural/magical significance of five is pervasive No records of arrangement exist (predates history) Theories The Weaver's Design (Orthodox) - The divine pattern-maker arranged the moons as part of fate's infrastructure - They serve The Loom's function - Their arrangement proves intelligent design - Questioning further is impious The Ancient Engineers (Scholarly) - A pre-human or early human civilization moved the moons - Perhaps the same civilization that built the polar structures - The technology is lost, but the result persists - Understanding how could unlock power The Elsewhere Anchor (Heterodox) - The moons are anchor points for Elsewhere connection - They define the boundaries of the bleed - Their arrangement determines where and when the Elsewhere can manifest - The five factions may correspond to the five moons The Prison Bars (Hollow Saint) - The moons are part of the cage of fate - They enforce the S\u00f3rscad system - Disrupting them might free humanity from pattern - (Nobody has proposed a method) The Natural Improbability (Fleshwright) - Improbable doesn't mean impossible - Given the universe's age, unlikely configurations happen somewhere - Attributing design is anthropocentric bias - The cultural significance was imposed after, not built in Observable Evidence Supporting Artificial Arrangement : - V\u00e9g's spectral inconsistency (not normal material) - Perfect resonance ratios - Correlation between moon positions and magical phenomena - The Elsewhere bleed's relationship to lunar cycles Against : - No construction evidence on moon surfaces (from telescopes) - No historical records despite extensive ancient archives - If arrangement technology existed, where is it? The Working Answer For practical purposes, most people accept: - The moons are where they are - They affect tides, magic, and fate - Whether designed or natural, they're part of reality - Understanding the how might matter; understanding the why probably doesn't Calendar and Timekeeping The Lunar Calendar Various cultures use different moon-based calendars: L\u00e9lek Months : - 30-day months (L\u00e9lek's period) - 11.67 months per year - Practical but doesn't divide evenly V\u00e9g Weeks : - 12-day \"weeks\" (V\u00e9g's period) - 29.22 weeks per year - Used in some trading cultures The Five-Moon Year : - Track all five moons' cycles - Complex but comprehensive - Used by Loom-Keepers and astrologers - Average person can't maintain Standard Timekeeping Most cultures have settled on: - 36-hour day divided into segments (varies by culture) - Year of 350-351 days (with intercalary adjustments) - Five seasons as primary year division - Lunar positions noted for special occasions Further documentation needed on: Detailed tide tables by region, eclipse prediction methods, calendar conversion between systems, moon surface mapping, tidal creature behavior","title":"Lunar System"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/lunar_system/#halcova-lunar-system-and-celestial-mechanics","text":"","title":"H\u00e1lcova: Lunar System and Celestial Mechanics"},{"location":"halcova/planetary/lunar_system/#overview","text":"H\u00e1lcova's five moons are not natural.

The Five Regions 1. The Greater Continent (The Heartlands) Location : Largest landmass, northern habitable band Geography : - Central mountain spine (east-west, blocks polar winds) - Large interior plateau (cold, harsh, sparse population) - River valleys to coasts (population centers) - Northern edge merges into ice cap Character : - Orthodox faith dominant - Great Loom Node (largest, oldest, most accurate) - Political center\u2014unified governance (empires, kingdoms) - Oldest civilizations, deepest Residue deposits Climate : Subarctic (north) to cold continental (center) to \"mild\" coastal (south) 2. The Shattered Reaches Location : Fragmented landmass east of the Heartlands Geography : - One large island-continent broken by seas - Many smaller islands in chains and clusters - Rugged coastlines, deep fjords - Sea ice connects islands during Csend Character : - Politically fragmented (city-states, merchant leagues) - Naval power dominant - Trading culture connecting all regions - Religious diversity - Strong Ancestor Speaker traditions Climate : Maritime-moderated, foggier and wetter, shorter ice seasons 3. The Middle Waters Location : Island archipelago in equatorial band (warmest zone) Geography : - Volcanic island chain (geothermal heat) - Central \"great island\" (dormant supervolcano caldera) - Hundreds of smaller islands - Cold-adapted reef systems Character : - Most valuable real estate (warmth) - Contested by all other regions - Colony traditions strong (warm, wet favors fungal growth) - Unique ecosystem - Cultural melting pot Climate : Warmest on H\u00e1lcova (10-20\u00b0C in L\u00e1ng), never freezes 4. The Vent Lands Location : Volcanic continental fragment, southern hemisphere Geography : - Active volcanic ranges - Hot springs, geysers, fumaroles - Geothermal valleys (reliable heat) - Toxic zones (volcanic gas accumulation) - Glacier-thermal interfaces (flooding, steam) Character : - Heat independent of Residue (geothermal) - Wealthy (no fuel dependency) - Politically independent - Unique industries (geothermal metallurgy) - Fleshwright traditions strong - Weaker Orthodox presence Climate : Extreme local variation, steam weather, lush valleys next to frozen peaks 5. The Far Shelf Location : Most distant continent, southern hemisphere Geography : - Large, relatively flat landmass - Extensive tundra and taiga-equivalent - Mineral-rich, difficult extraction - Southern edge touches ice cap - Long coastlines, few harbors Character : - Frontier region (last colonized) - Heterodox faiths dominant - Threadist movements originated here - Hollow Saints more open presence - Less Loom coverage - Independence-minded population Climate : Cold even in L\u00e1ng, extreme seasonal darkness, shortest growing season The Seas The Narrow Sea : Between Heartlands and Shattered Reaches - Heavily trafficked, partially freezes in Csend - Major trade route, historical naval battles The Central Ocean : Between northern and southern landmasses - Large, dangerous - Liquid center even in Csend (thermal upwelling) - Middle Waters in warmest region The Vent Strait : Between Middle Waters and Vent Lands - Warm currents from geothermal activity - Never freezes, dense shipping The Far Water : Between Shattered Reaches and Far Shelf - Widest crossing, most dangerous - Storms, distance, cold The Bitter Crossing : Between Heartlands and Far Shelf (polar route) - Frozen solid in Csend (ice road) - Impassable other seasons - Historical only connection before long-distance sailing Polar Regions The Northern Cap : - Permanent ice sheet - No sustained civilization - Expedition territory only - Rumors of ancient ruins beneath ice - Source of rare materials - Full Elsewhere bleed during K\u00f6d The Southern Cap : - Permanent ice sheet - Touches Far Shelf's southern coast - Different character than northern cap (unknown why) - Full Elsewhere bleed during K\u00f6d K\u00f6d: The Fifth Season in Detail The Polar Bleed During K\u00f6d, the boundary between H\u00e1lcova and Elsewhere thins. The effect is strongest at the poles and diminishes toward the equator. Full Bleed (Polar Regions) Physical Environment : - Visual distortions (wrong distances, shifted colors) - Sound anomalies (echoes from nothing, unnatural silence) - Temperature fluctuations unconnected to weather - Ground-level aurora-like phenomena Entity Activity : - Elsewhere beings manifest without summoning - Appear partial, flickering, attention wandering - Most ignore humans; some don't - All five factions appear: - Accountants : Counting, ignoring unless debts exist - Hungry : Seeking sensation\u2014the dangerous ones - Architects : Adjusting, positioning, arranging - Mirrors : Watching, following, studying observers - Absent : Simply present, doing nothing visible Human Effects : - Pact Summoners feel entities without calling - Core Binders' echoes become hyperactive, may realize they're dead - Fate Threaders pull \"sideways\" futures - Colony hosts feel colonies reaching toward something - Unpacted humans: hallucinations, intrusions, compulsions Partial Bleed (Transition Zones) Entities sensed but not fully manifest Voices, glimpses, influences Stronger effects near polar edge Habitable but disturbing Some permanent settlements with adaptation strategies Minor Phenomena (Temperate Band) Vivid dreams, especially of unlived lives D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and premonition spikes Paranoia and suspicion increase Minor visual/auditory phenomena Loom predictions become strange (accurate about improbable things) Protected Zone (Middle Waters) Minimal K\u00f6d effects Theories: warmth, volcanic activity, population density, unknown factor Refugees flee toward Middle Waters during K\u00f6d Prices and tensions spike Who Enters the Polar Bleed? The Desperate : Seeking pacts without leverage, escaping patterns, pursuing forbidden knowledge The Fortified : Research expeditions, military operations, resource extraction (heavy protection) The Trapped : Outposts that can't evacuate, indigenous survivors, things that were human Religious Responses Orthodox : Polar bleed proves the danger of straying from The Weaver's design. Wardens close transition borders. Returnees examined for contamination. Threadist : The bleed shows fate is unfinished. Insights from K\u00f6d may reveal the collaborative nature of design. Hollow Saint : The bleed is the crack in fate's prison. Pilgrimage to the edge (not into full bleed) is holy work. Colony Cult : Colonies remember something from the bleed. The original unity existed there. Ancestor Speaker : Echoes become dangerous during K\u00f6d. This is when the dead most need binding\u2014for their protection. Fleshwright : Elsewhere entities are just different biology. Study them (safely) to understand life without pattern. Pattern Residue Thermodynamics The Mechanism Pattern Residue is \"condensed probability\"\u2014fate-weight made physical. This exotic matter has unusual thermodynamic properties. Charged State : - Residue in natural/raw form actively absorbs thermal energy - Pulls heat from environment into itself - Stores energy as captured entropy/information Triggered Release : - Specific conditions (chemical, magical, mechanical) release stored energy - Energy emerges as heat - Residue becomes \"spent\" or \"ash\"\u2014thermodynamically inert Equilibrium : - Natural Residue absorbs until saturated - Slowly re-radiates over time - Absorption is fast; re-radiation is slow - Net effect: heat trapped, world cooled The Climate Feedback Loop Death releases Pattern Residue Residue absorbs heat from environment Environment cools Cold contributes to death More Residue released Loop continues The Civilization Counter-Loop Residue is harvested Harvested Residue burned for heat Local heat released (cities warm) Spent Residue doesn't return to atmosphere Less atmospheric Residue = slightly warmer baseline But harvesting draws more Residue toward cities Surrounding areas relatively colder Cities become warm islands Implications The Dark Bargain : Civilization survives by burning death. The more death harvested, the warmer cities can be. Peace reduces fuel supply. Climate Control : Institutions could warm or cool regions by managing Residue distribution. This is probably happening. The Polar Question : Why so cold? Ancient mass death? Residue migration? Deliberate engineering? Elsewhere connection? The Middle Waters Question : Why warm? Volcanic heat? Less historical death? Living density? Unknown protection?

The S\u00f3rscad pattern determines access to credit, employment, insurance, and opportunity. Pattern Residue\u2014the energy of dissolving fates\u2014fuels magic and industry. Death is literally productive. This creates an economy where some people are worth more dead than alive, where peace is expensive, and where the institutions that predict your future have financial stakes in that prediction coming true. The Fate Market Pattern as Asset Your S\u00f3rscad is not just identity\u2014it's capital. Pattern-Weight Some patterns are \"heavier\" than others: - More fate-significance - More likely to impact events - More valuable as Pattern Residue when released Heavy patterns belong to: - Those born into consequential circumstances - Those whose choices ripple outward - Those predicted for significant outcomes (positive or negative) Light patterns belong to: - Those born into marginal circumstances - Those whose choices affect few others - Those predicted for unremarkable outcomes The Market Implications Heavy patterns command higher prices in substitution deals (Pact Summoning) Heavy patterns produce more valuable Residue upon death Heavy patterns are worth more to The Loom (more data value) Heavy patterns are targets for various exploitation This creates a hierarchy: some lives have more market value than others, calculated and priced. Pattern Speculation Fate Futures Financial instruments that pay out based on whether predictions come true: \"If subject achieves predicted career trajectory by age 30, contract pays X\" \"If subject dies by predicted cause within predicted window, contract pays Y\" \"If subject deviates significantly from pattern, contract is void\" Who Trades These Insurance companies (hedging their risk assessments) Investment houses (speculating on populations) Criminal organizations (betting on specific outcomes they can influence) Governments (managing demographic predictions) Pattern Arbitrage Some patterns are mispriced. The Loom's predictions, while accurate on average, have errors in individual cases. Arbitrageurs look for: - Patterns undervalued by The Loom (capable people dismissed as low-potential) - Patterns overvalued by The Loom (impressive readings masking actual mediocrity) - Situations where environmental change will shift pattern-outcomes They invest in undervalued people\u2014education, opportunity, resources\u2014and profit when those people outperform predictions. This is legal. It's also morally ambiguous: you're betting on people, treating lives as investments, profiting from the gap between predicted and actual humanity. Credit and Debt Pattern-Based Lending All credit decisions incorporate S\u00f3rscad data: Interest Rates Pattern-privileged: Low rates. The Loom predicts they'll repay. Pattern-constrained: High rates. The Loom predicts elevated default risk. Pattern-illegible (practitioners): Variable. Their patterns are too contaminated for reliable prediction. Collateral What can you pledge? Physical assets (traditional) Future earnings (income garnishment) Pattern Residue rights (if you die, the lender harvests) Pact-substitution rights (you can be offered to an Elsewhere entity) Echo-binding rights (you can be bound after death) The last three are where lending gets dark. Poor borrowers often have nothing to pledge but themselves\u2014their deaths, their souls, their eternal servitude as echoes. Debt Spirals The pattern-constrained start with high rates, struggle to repay, take on more debt to service existing debt, and eventually pledge increasingly extreme collateral. Endpoint possibilities: - Debt-bondage (working off the debt under contract) - Residue-pledge (worth more dead than alive) - Pact-transfer (sold to cover what you owe) - Echo-indenture (bound to serve after death) The system is designed to produce these endpoints. They're not failures of the system\u2014they're the system working as intended. The Pact Economy Elsewhere Entities as Lenders Pact Summoning functions like supernatural credit: - You receive power now - You pay with your core later - Interest accrues (the more you use, the faster you pay) - Default is impossible (the entity always collects) Substitution as Currency Cores are fungible. The entity doesn't care whose core it gets. This creates: - Substitution markets : Where cores are bought and sold - Core brokers : Middlemen connecting those with cores to sell and summoners needing payment - Substitution pricing : Heavy patterns worth more, light patterns worth less - Procurement operations : Acquiring cores through various means (legal and otherwise) The Substitution Hierarchy From most to least valuable: 1. Exceptional patterns (seventh son of seventh son, etc.) 2. Heavy patterns from powerful lineages 3. Standard adult patterns 4. Light adult patterns 5. Child patterns (potential not yet realized) 6. Elderly patterns (mostly spent) 7. Animal patterns (weak, but abundant) This is a price list for souls. It exists. People consult it. Employment and Opportunity Pattern-Gated Careers Many positions require specific pattern profiles: Explicit Requirements - \"Must have Court-Field or Heights-Field classification\" - \"No Wound-Self or Shard-Self candidates\" - \"Minimum Road-Path or Ladder-Path trajectory\" Implicit Screening Even without stated requirements, hiring decisions incorporate pattern data: - \"We don't discriminate based on pattern\u2014we just look at the whole candidate\" - \"Their pattern doesn't fit our company culture\" - \"The Loom predicts retention issues with that profile\" Pattern Families and Stereotypes Certain pattern-combinations are associated with professions: \"Lamplighters\" (Lantern-Road-Pact-Duty-Court) - Bureaucrats, administrators, reliable employees - Boring but dependable - Automatically considered for stable positions \"Storm-Children\" (Spark-Crossroads-Twin-Rebel-Wild) - Artists, adventurers, troublemakers - Exciting but unreliable - Automatically excluded from positions requiring stability \"Knot-Born\" (Wound-Maze-Thorn-Fear-Street) - Criminals, laborers, expendables - Dangerous but useful - Automatically considered for dangerous or demeaning work These stereotypes become self-fulfilling. Denied legitimate opportunity, the Knot-Born turn to illegitimate work. Their criminal records confirm The Loom's predictions. The cycle continues. Labor Markets Pattern Segregation Different patterns concentrate in different industries: - Heights-Field patterns in management - Forge-Field patterns in manufacturing - Street-Field patterns in informal economy - Underbelly-Field patterns in criminal enterprise This isn't natural sorting\u2014it's structural channeling. Each pattern is directed toward \"appropriate\" work from Binding Day onward. Wage Differentials Same work, different pay, based on pattern: - Pattern-privileged workers paid more (justified as \"retention cost\") - Pattern-constrained workers paid less (justified as \"risk premium\") - The gap is legal, documented, defended as actuarially sound The Pattern Residue Economy Production Pattern Residue is produced when patterns dissolve\u2014primarily at death. Natural Production - Every death releases some Residue - More from heavy patterns - More from traumatic deaths - More from pattern-rich populations Sites of Concentration - Battlefields (mass death, often violent) - Plague zones (mass death, weakened patterns) - Execution grounds (controlled, harvestable) - Disaster sites (concentrated mortality) Manufactured Production The demand for Residue creates incentives: - War as industry (mass death with geographic concentration) - Plague management (letting disease run for harvest) - Capital punishment as production (not justice, but fuel) - Blood sports (entertainment plus Residue) The Residue Trade Harvesting Licensed harvesters extract Residue from death sites. Unlicensed harvesters do the same, illegally. Equipment required: - Collection apparatus (varies by tradition) - Storage containers (keeping Residue stable) - Transportation (Residue degrades; speed matters) Occupational hazards: - Exposure effects (too much contact changes you) - Competition (other harvesters, scavengers, authorities) - Moral weight (you're literally profiting from death) Refinement Raw Residue requires processing for most uses: - Purification (removing contaminants) - Stabilization (extending shelf life) - Concentration (increasing potency) - Packaging (making it tradeable) Refineries are industrial operations\u2014factories of death-product. Distribution Residue reaches end users through: - Official channels (licensed trade, taxation, regulation) - Gray markets (legal but questionable sourcing) - Black markets (illegal, untaxed, often higher quality) Pricing Residue prices fluctuate based on: - Supply (peace = scarce; war = abundant) - Quality (pure vs. contaminated) - Source (some deaths produce better Residue) - Demand (more practitioners = higher prices) During prolonged peace, prices spike. Some institutions have incentives to prevent peace from lasting. The Moral Economy Who Benefits From Death The Loom (fuel for operation) Core Binders (fuel for anchors) Residue traders (profit margin) Magitech industries (raw material) Anyone using Residue-powered devices Who Provides Death The pattern-constrained (dying in wars, plagues, prisons) The poor (selling Residue rights for cash now) The condemned (executed for production) Populations deemed \"surplus\" The economy of H\u00e1lcova is built on bodies. Clean hands are expensive. Everyone is complicit at some remove. Class Structure The Pattern-Privileged Characteristics - Born with or drawn into favorable patterns - The Loom predicts success; institutions deliver it - Low interest rates, good jobs, favorable treatment How They Stay Privileged - Marry within pattern-class (maintaining lineage patterns) - Leverage pattern-capital into actual capital - Use wealth to insulate from pattern-deviation consequences - Support institutions that validate pattern-prediction Their Perspective - \"The system works\u2014look at my success\" - \"Pattern-discrimination is just actuarial accuracy\" - \"If their patterns predicted better, they'd do better\" The Pattern-Constrained Characteristics - Born with or drawn into unfavorable patterns - The Loom predicts struggle; institutions ensure it - High interest rates, bad jobs, hostile treatment How They Stay Constrained - Denied opportunity that might disprove predictions - Forced into circumstances that confirm predictions - Accumulate debt, criminal records, health problems - Each confirmation further constrains next generation Their Perspective - \"The system is rigged\u2014look at my constraints\" - \"They decided what I'd be before I could decide anything\" - \"Success despite pattern proves nothing; they just call it deviation\" The Pattern-Illegible Characteristics - Practitioners whose patterns are contaminated, faded, or transformed - The Loom can't predict them reliably - Treated with suspicion, opportunity, or both Types - Heavy Core Binders (layered patterns from echo-bleed) - Established Flesh Shapers (hollowed H\u00faslaimh circles) - Deep Pact Summoners (faded L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 from payment) - Depleted Fate Threaders (narrowed S\u00f3rscad from extraction) - Long-term Colony Hosts (hybrid patterns from transformation) Their Position - Some institutions exclude them (can't assess risk) - Some institutions seek them (unpredictability is useful) - They exist outside normal class structure - Often form their own communities and networks The Industrial Magitech Sector Residue-Powered Technology Pattern Residue isn't just for practitioners\u2014it powers industry. Applications - Pattern-engines (The Loom and derivatives) - Communication systems (pattern-resonance transmission) - Transportation (Residue-fueled vehicles for high-priority use) - Manufacturing (certain processes require Residue catalyst) - Weapons (Residue-enhanced ammunition, siege equipment) The Magic-Industrial Complex Industries dependent on Residue form a political bloc: - They need steady supply (war, plague, execution) - They oppose peace when it threatens supply - They support policies that produce harvestable death - They lobby against restrictions on harvesting This isn't conspiracy\u2014it's interest group politics. The people running these industries aren't monsters. They're responding to incentives. The incentives produce monstrous outcomes. Labor in Magitech Working with Residue changes you. Long-term exposure: - Physical effects (pallor, temperature sensitivity, pattern-interference) - Psychological effects (death-awareness, morbid outlook) - Social effects (stigma, isolation from non-exposed) Residue-industry workers are pattern-constrained almost by definition. The work confirms their patterns, trapping them further.

The S\u00f3rscad pattern is not just a predictive framework\u2014it's the primary evidence of divine existence. Something assigns patterns. Something makes predictions accurate. Something answers when The Loom queries. That something is worshipped, feared, manipulated, and denied in various ways. But it is never ignored. The Core Theological Question What is Fate? All religions in H\u00e1lcova grapple with this. The answers vary, but the question is universal: Is Fate a conscious entity with will and purpose? Is Fate an impersonal force, like gravity or time? Is Fate many entities, or one entity with many faces? Is Fate the same as the Elsewhere, or something that contains or transcends it? Is Fate benevolent, malevolent, or indifferent? The evidence is ambiguous. The Loom works. Predictions come true. Something responds to ritual. But what it wants, why it responds, and whether it cares about human wellbeing\u2014these remain contested. The Orthodoxy: The Church of the Weaver Orthodox Core Beliefs The dominant religious framework across most of H\u00e1lcova. The Weaver ( A Sz\u00f6v\u0151 ) is: The divine pattern-maker who creates all S\u00f3rscads The source of The Loom's accuracy The author of fate, whose design is perfect even when painful Neither purely benevolent nor malevolent\u2014 necessary Doctrine : The Pattern Is Sacred : Your S\u00f3rscad is your divinely-assigned role. It reflects The Weaver's purpose for you. Acceptance Is Virtue : Embracing your pattern, even its hardships, is holy. Resistance creates suffering. The Loom Is True : The Loom reads The Weaver's will accurately. Trust its predictions. Deviation Is Sin : Acting against your pattern wounds the cosmic design. Enforcement is medicine, not punishment. The Design Serves : The Weaver's plan serves existence itself, not individual happiness. Your suffering has purpose you cannot see. Orthodox Practices The Drawings : Natal and Binding draws are religious ceremonies, not just administrative procedures. Priests conduct them. Families gather. The revelation of pattern is considered a holy moment. Pattern-Prayer : Daily meditation on your S\u00f3rscad. Contemplating its meaning, accepting its implications, aligning will with fate. Correction Rituals : When you've acted against pattern, confession and ritual penance. Overseen by priests, recorded in temple registers. Death Rites : Ensuring proper Pattern Residue release. Prayers for the L\u00e9ilcr\u00f9 to return cleanly to The Weaver's design. Orthodox Structure Temples at every significant settlement Priests trained in theology and basic pattern-reading Bishops overseeing regional temples The High Weavery : Central authority, located at the Great Node The Synod : Overlapping governance with the Warden Order Who Believes This (Orthodox) The pattern-privileged (the system validates them) Those raised in Orthodox communities Those who find comfort in cosmic purpose Institutions that benefit from pattern-enforcement The Appeal Orthodoxy offers: Meaning (your suffering has purpose) Community (shared belief and practice) Structure (clear rules and expectations) Comfort (fate is in capable hands) For people whose patterns predict good outcomes, this is easy faith. For those whose patterns predict hardship, it's harder\u2014but some find peace in submission. The Threadist Reformation: Fate as Collaboration Threadist Core Beliefs A reform movement within Orthodoxy that takes a different view of deviation. Key Difference : The Weaver is not finished weaving. Fate is still being created. Your choices participate in the design. Doctrine : The Pattern Is Draft : Your S\u00f3rscad is a starting point, not a sentence. The Weaver offers threads; you help weave. Deviation Is Data : When someone acts against pattern, it might be error\u2014or it might be new information. The design evolves. Fate Threading Is Collaboration : The Art isn't theft from fate\u2014it's working with unfinished material. Threaders are co-creators. The Loom Predicts, Not Prescribes : Accuracy reflects current patterns, not fixed destiny. Change the patterns, change the predictions. Agency Is Sacred : Free will is The Weaver's gift, not its enemy. Choosing is how we participate in creation. Threadist Implications Threadists: Accept Fate Threading as legitimate (with ethical constraints) View enforcement with suspicion (forcing patterns may be anti-divine) See deviation as potentially holy (revelation of new design elements) Believe The Loom should inform, not control Who Believes This (Threadists) Fate Threaders seeking religious justification Pattern-constrained seeking hope for change Intellectuals uncomfortable with determinism Reformers within Orthodox institutions Orthodox Response to Threadists The Orthodoxy considers Threadism heresy: \"The design is complete. Claiming otherwise is pride.\" \"Agency serves the pattern, not the reverse.\" \"Threadist doctrine justifies sin and chaos.\" Threadists are tolerated in some regions, persecuted in others. The Warden Order considers them ideologically dangerous. The Hollow Saints: Fate as Prison Hollow Saint Core Beliefs A heretical movement that inverts Orthodox values entirely. Core Insight : The S\u00f3rscad is a cage. The Weaver is a jailer. True freedom comes from escaping your pattern entirely. Doctrine : Fate Is Bondage : Patterns are chains. Predictions are control. The Loom is a surveillance apparatus. The Weaver Is Enemy : Whatever assigns patterns does not have human interests at heart. Worship is collaboration with your oppressor. Elsewhere Is Escape : Selling your core to Elsewhere entities isn't damnation\u2014it's liberation. They're taking you out of the cage. The Absent Are Saints : The Elsewhere faction that wants nothing \u2014they represent true freedom. No pattern, no prediction, no control. Emptiness Is Peace : The consumed\u2014those whose cores are fully paid\u2014are not victims. They're free. The husk left behind isn't a tragedy; it's a chrysalis. Hollow Saint Practices Pact Encouragement : Hollow Saint communities help members make pacts. They provide information on entities, facilitate contacts, support those paying their debts. Substitution Ethics : Unlike casual pact-users, Hollow Saints have complex ethics around substitution. Some refuse it entirely (liberation should be chosen). Others permit it for the unwilling (freeing them from patterns they hate). The Empty Honored : Those fully consumed are celebrated. Their remains are treated with reverence. They escaped. Proselytization : Spreading the truth about Fate's prison nature. Recruiting those most oppressed by their patterns. Who Believes This (Hollow Saints) Pact Summoners seeking ideological framework The pattern-condemned who've given up on Orthodox comfort Those who've watched loved ones consumed and need meaning Anti-institutional radicals Orthodox Response to Hollow Saints The Orthodoxy considers this satanic heresy: \"They worship demons and call it freedom.\" \"The consumed aren't free\u2014they're destroyed.\" \"This cult leads people to eternal annihilation.\" The Warden Order hunts Hollow Saints aggressively. The cult operates in secret, recruitment happens quietly, and practicing openly means death. The Fleshwright Materialists: Fate as Biology Fleshwright Core Beliefs A philosophical-religious position emerging from Flesh Shaping traditions. Core Insight : The pattern isn't divine\u2014it's biological. The S\u00f3rscad is legible because bodies are predictable. There is no Weaver. There is only meat. Doctrine : Patterns Are Organic : The S\u00f3rscad reads biological tendencies\u2014brain structure, hormonal predisposition, physical capacity. Calling this \"divine\" is superstition. Prediction Is Statistics : The Loom works because large populations behave predictably. This isn't fate\u2014it's probability. Homunculi Prove It : Flesh Shapers create life without patterns. If fate were real, they couldn't. The fact that homunculi exist outside The Loom shows the system is physical, not metaphysical. Liberation Through Construction : The goal is to build beings entirely outside pattern . Not escaping fate\u2014transcending the biological substrate that makes prediction possible. Whatever Answers The Loom is not divine. It's something that reads biology. Understanding what it is (probably Elsewhere, probably interested in Pattern Residue) demystifies the entire system. Fleshwright Implications Fleshwrights: Practice Flesh Shaping as philosophical statement Seek to create pattern-free life View The Loom as technology, not religion Want to understand the Attendance scientifically Who Believes This (Fleshwrights) Flesh Shapers with intellectual ambitions Materialist philosophers Scientists studying pattern-biology Anti-religious secularists Orthodox Response to Fleshwrights Fleshwrights are considered dangerous atheists: \"They deny the sacred to excuse their abominations.\" \"Their constructs are hollow precisely because they lack divine pattern.\" \"Calling the Attendance 'technology' is willful blindness.\" Fleshwrights aren't persecuted as violently as Hollow Saints (they're not recruiting the desperate to suicide-by-pact), but they're excluded from respectable society in Orthodox regions. The Colony Cults: Fate as Composite Colony Cult Core Beliefs Religious movements centered on fungal colony symbolism and practice. Core Insight : Individual patterns are fragments of a larger whole. The colonies remember older, deeper patterns. True fate isn't personal\u2014it's collective. Doctrine : The Great Network : Before individuals, there was connection. The original pattern was One, not many. Separation is the wound. Colonies Remember : Ancient fungal networks carry patterns older than The Loom, older than the Orthodoxy. They know what fate was before it was divided. Hosting Is Reunion : Taking a colony into yourself is rejoining the original pattern. Your individual S\u00f3rscad becomes part of something larger. Death Serves Life : When colonies consume the dead, they preserve patterns that would otherwise dissipate. This is holy recycling, not desecration. The Old Ones : The most ancient colonies, passed through generations, may themselves be divine. Or at least more divine than The Weaver, who only divides. Colony Cult Practices Communal Infection : Deliberate colony-sharing within cult communities. Everyone carries the same strain; everyone is connected. Ancestor Incorporation : Feeding the colony deceased cult members. They persist in the network's memory. Not bound like echoes\u2014 integrated . Network Communion : Group rituals where hosts link through their colonies. Shared sensation, shared memory, something like shared consciousness. Fruit Offerings : Summoning constructs from colony-memory as offerings to the network itself. Returning patterns to the collective. Who Believes This (Colony Cults) Colony Hosts seeking spiritual framework Communities where hosting is traditional Those who've experienced network-communion and found it meaningful Those seeking alternative to individualistic fate-models Orthodox Response to Colony Cults Colony Cults are considered primitive and dangerous: \"They worship parasites and call it communion.\" \"Their 'memories' are contaminated, not sacred.\" \"Infection-spreading is assault, not religion.\" Colony Cults exist in legal gray zones. Hosting itself may be legal; deliberate infection is not. Cults that stay private are tolerated. Cults that proselytize are persecuted. The Ancestor Speakers: Fate as Conversation Ancestor Speaker Core Beliefs Religious traditions centered on Core Binding as ancestral communion. Core Insight : Your pattern includes everyone who came before. The dead aren't gone\u2014they're waiting to be heard. Binding is not imprisonment; it's invitation. Doctrine : The Pattern Is Genealogy : Your S\u00f3rscad carries traces of ancestral patterns. You are your lineage speaking through new flesh. The Dead Advise : Properly bound echoes aren't prisoners\u2014they're advisors. They see what you cannot. They know what you haven't learned. Binding Is Dialogue : The relationship between binder and echo should be collaborative. Listen to them. Honor them. Release them when the conversation is complete. The Loom Sees Surface : Pattern-prediction captures tendencies, not depths. The ancestors see depths. Both are needed. Death Is Transition : The dead move from speaking to spoken-to. Binding maintains their voice in the world. Release returns them to the greater conversation. Ancestor Speaker Practices Ancestral Binding : Deliberately binding family dead for guidance. Sometimes for generations. Echo Council : Group decision-making that includes bound ancestors. The living propose; the dead advise. Binding Ethics : Strict rules about who can be bound (family only, or with permission), how they should be treated (respect, not command), and when to release (when the conversation ends). Pattern Reading : Interpreting current S\u00f3rscads through ancestral context. \"Your Wound-Self echoes your grandmother's; let's ask her about it.\" Who Believes This (Ancestor Speakers) Core Binders from traditional lineages Communities where binding is ancestral practice Those who've had meaningful echo relationships Those seeking ethical framework for binding Orthodox Response to Ancestor Speakers Ancestor Speaking is the most tolerated heterodoxy: \"At least they honor the dead, in their way.\" \"The errors are containable within proper binding law.\" \"Better this than the Hollow Saints.\" In practice, Ancestor Speakers often coexist with Orthodoxy. They attend Orthodox temples, participate in Orthodox rites, and quietly maintain their echo-relationships at home. The Warden Order monitors but rarely persecutes. Common Themes Across All Faiths The Loom's Accuracy Is Accepted No tradition denies that predictions work. They disagree about: Why they work (divine vs. biological vs. Elsewhere) Whether they should work (fate as good vs. fate as control) What to do about it (accept vs. resist vs. escape vs. transcend) Something Answers All traditions acknowledge that something responds to The Loom's queries. They disagree about: What it is (Weaver vs. Elsewhere vs. technology vs. network) What it wants (cosmic design vs. Pattern Residue vs. unknown) Whether to serve it, use it, or escape it Death Matters Pattern Residue, core harvesting, and what happens when patterns dissolve\u2014all traditions have positions: Orthodox: return to The Weaver's design Threadists: pattern continues influencing unfinished design Hollow Saints: liberation from pattern Fleshwrights: biological decay, nothing more Colony Cults: preservation in the network Ancestor Speakers: transition to advisory role Individual vs. Collective Fate The tension between personal pattern and collective destiny runs through everything: Orthodox: individual patterns serve collective design Threadists: individual choices shape collective future Hollow Saints: escape is individual; liberation is personal Fleshwrights: transcendence is biological, not spiritual Colony Cults: individual is illusion; collective is truth Ancestor Speakers: individual is genealogy speaking Religious Geography Orthodox Dominance The Core regions, major cities, centers of power. Temples everywhere. Warden Order presence. Pattern-enforcement integrated with governance. Heterodox Pockets Frontier regions, traditional communities, places where Orthodox reach is weak. Various heresies coexist, sometimes in the same village. Underground Hollow Saints, radical Fleshwrights, aggressive Colony Cults. Operating in secret even in Orthodox heartland. Networks of the desperate and the convicted. Contested Regions where multiple traditions compete openly. Religious conflict overlapping with political conflict. Conversion and counter-conversion.

They are investigators, hunters, judges, and executioners rolled into one\u2014a zealot force dedicated to ensuring that Fate's predictions come true and that no one escapes their pattern. They are, in essence, the Loom's police. But \"police\" doesn't capture the theological dimension. To the Wardens, deviation from pattern isn't crime. It's heresy. It's cosmic disorder. It's a wound in reality that must be cauterized. Purpose and Mandate The Problem They Solve The Loom's predictions are accurate\u2014but not perfectly accurate. Deviations occur: Someone predicted for a Road-Path career pivots unexpectedly A Blade-H\u00e1lmaht pattern survives past their statistical death-window A Knot-Born pattern achieves what their family should have prevented A Core Binder escapes their bleed-trajectory through unknown means A Pact Summoner pays their debt early through suspicious circumstances Most deviations are noise. Some are environmental factors The Loom missed. But some\u2014the ones that matter\u2014represent deliberate manipulation. Pattern-Fraud : Misrepresenting your S\u00f3rscad to gain advantage. Pattern-Evasion : Deliberately acting against your pattern. Pattern-Manipulation : Attempting to change your pattern through magic or ritual. Pattern-Interference : Helping others evade or manipulate their patterns. The Warden Order exists to detect, investigate, and punish these crimes against Fate. The Theological Mandate To the Orthodox faithful, your S\u00f3rscad is your divinely-assigned role in existence. Deviation is not just illegal\u2014it's an assault on cosmic order. Deviation creates ripples that damage the design Enforcement is not punishment\u2014it's correction They are not cruel\u2014they are necessary Structure and Organization The Ranks Initiates ( Kezd\u0151k ) Trainees undergoing Loom-attunement Not yet granted enforcement authority Assist full Wardens in investigations High washout rate (many cannot handle the attunement) Wardens ( \u0150r\u00f6k ) Full enforcement authority Licensed to investigate, arrest, and judge minor deviations Operate individually or in pairs Most common rank; the ones civilians encounter Priors ( El\u0151j\u00e1r\u00f3k ) Supervisory rank overseeing multiple Wardens Authority over major deviation cases Can convene judgment tribunals Often stationed at major Loom-Nodes Calculators ( Sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3k ) Specialized analysts who interpret Loom data Identify patterns of deviation across populations Predict where manipulation is likely occurring Rarely operate in the field; their work is in the archives High Wardens ( F\u0151\u0151r\u00f6k ) Regional commanders Direct authority over all enforcement in their territory Answer only to the Synod Political as well as religious figures The Synod ( Zsinat ) Governing council of the Order Seven High Wardens plus the Loom-Keeper General Sets enforcement policy and theological interpretation Meets at the Great Node in [capital city TBD] The Attunement Wardens are not simply trained. They are attuned \u2014connected to The Loom in a way that grants them abilities beyond normal Loom-Keepers. The Process : Conducted at a major Loom-Node Involves extended contact with a pattern-engine The initiate opens themselves to the Attendance Something is exchanged\u2014given and received Those who survive are changed What Attunement Grants : Pattern-Sight : Wardens can see S\u00f3rscad patterns without mechanical assistance. Not complete readings\u2014impressions, dominant circles, deviations from expected behavior. Deviation-Sense : A feeling\u2014almost physical\u2014when someone nearby is acting against their pattern. Like hearing a wrong note in a familiar song. Loom-Voice : The ability to query The Loom mentally, receiving basic information about a subject's pattern and prediction-status. Limited range, requires concentration. Thread-Touch : In physical contact, a Warden can feel someone's fate-weight. How heavy their pattern is, how much remains, how much has been spent or sold. What Attunement Costs : Pattern-Lock : An attuned Warden's own S\u00f3rscad becomes fixed. They cannot deviate from their own pattern without experiencing severe dissonance. They are bound to their fate more tightly than any civilian. Resonance : Wardens feel deviations as personal discomfort. A city full of pattern-fraud gives them migraines. Proximity to heavy manipulation can be physically painful. Connection : The Attendance is always there, in the back of their minds. Not controlling\u2014observing. Some Wardens describe it as a patient presence. Others as a weight they can never put down. Life-Debt : Attunement shortens life. The connection draws on vital energy. Most Wardens don't reach old age. They burn out, consumed by the link that gives them power. The Attendance: What Wardens Serve The Open Secret Wardens know that something answers when they use their abilities. They don't call it The Weaver\u2014that's for civilians. Among themselves, they use the same term as senior Loom-Keepers: The Attendance . Most Wardens believe The Attendance is: An aspect of the divine Weaver A messenger or servant of Fate The voice of the pattern itself, given presence Some Wardens suspect: The Attendance is an Elsewhere entity Their attunement is a pact they didn't fully understand They're serving something with its own agenda This suspicion is not heresy\u2014it's occupational hazard. Wardens spend their lives detecting manipulation. Some start to wonder if they're being manipulated themselves. The Relationship The Attendance: Provides information when Wardens query Guides attention toward significant deviations Offers... suggestions. Urges. Directions that feel like their own ideas. Never forces action. Always presents as assistance. Rewards success with a sense of rightness, harmony, completion. Responds to failure with... nothing. Silence. Which somehow feels worse. The most dangerous Wardens are the ones who've stopped questioning whether their judgment is their own. Methods and Practices Investigation Detection : Loom-data analysis (Calculators identify statistical anomalies) Pattern-Sight (Wardens scanning crowds for deviation-impressions) Informants (the Order has networks in every district) Tip-lines (civilians reporting suspicious pattern-behavior) The Attendance (sometimes it simply... directs attention) Verification : Registry check (confirming recorded S\u00f3rscad) Prediction-review (what should this person be doing?) Outcome analysis (what are they actually doing?) Pattern-reading (direct examination by attuned Warden) Interrogation (what do they know, and how do they know it) Arrest and Detention Wardens have broad authority: Can detain anyone for pattern-verification Can enter premises where deviation is suspected Can compel testimony from civilians Can hold suspects indefinitely pending investigation Limitations : Cannot execute without judgment (except immediate threat) Cannot detain the pattern-privileged without Prior authorization Cannot operate outside their territorial jurisdiction Cannot interfere with other Loom-Keeper operations In practice, limitations are flexible. Wardens have significant discretion. Abuse is common, especially against the pattern-constrained who have no advocates. Judgment Minor Deviations : Judged by the arresting Warden Sentences: fines, pattern-counseling, restricted movement, labor assignment No appeal to higher authority Recorded in subject's Registry file Major Deviations : Judged by Prior tribunal Sentences: imprisonment, pattern-modification attempt, indentured service, execution Limited appeal to High Warden Permanent Registry marking Extraordinary Deviations : Judged by High Warden or Synod directly Reserved for: practitioners, nobility, institutional actors, mass manipulation Sentences: public execution, family-pattern marking, institutional dissolution No appeal Execution Methods The Order believes execution should serve Fate, not just end a life. Pattern-Severance : The condemned's S\u00f3rscad is ritually dissolved before death. They die without a pattern, without a core to bind, without anything to sell to Elsewhere. Complete annihilation. Fate-Feeding : The condemned is killed in a way that maximizes Pattern Residue harvest. Their death serves The Loom directly. Their pattern-energy fuels the system that caught them. Public Correction : Traditional execution with public announcement of deviation type. Educational function\u2014showing civilians what happens to pattern-evaders. Specializations The Orthodoxy Wardens Standard enforcement. Investigate deviation, arrest offenders, pass judgment. The most common type, the ones civilians know. The Calculator Corps Analysts who never leave the archives. They read data patterns, identify manipulation signatures, predict where deviation will occur. They direct field Wardens to targets. The Echo-Hunters Specialize in Core Binding violations. Track illegal echo-harvesting, pattern-balancing operations, Registry manipulation through echo-contamination. They carry their own echoes\u2014captured from previous targets. The Flesh-Finders Specialize in Flesh Shaping violations. Hunt unlicensed Shapers, mimic-makers, blood-sourcing operations. They understand homunculi well enough to identify them on sight. The Pact-Breakers Specialize in Elsewhere-related violations. Extremely dangerous work. Track illegal pact-brokers, investigate substitution schemes, handle cases where Elsewhere interference is suspected. Some have made their own pacts, using the enemy's tools against them. The Thread-Cutters Specialize in Fate Threading violations. Hunt threaders who've pulled without license, extracted selves operating independently, fate-speculators manipulating pattern-markets. They're attuned to spot narrowed fate-webs. The Spore-Burners Specialize in Colony Hosting violations. Track feral colonies, illegal infection operations, hosts operating outside registration. They carry antifungal compounds and know how to identify contaminated pattern-readings. The Warden's Dilemma The Theology of Enforcement If Fate determines everything, how can anyone deviate? If deviation is impossible, why do Wardens exist? The Orthodox Answer : Deviation is part of Fate too The Weaver allows deviation so that correction can occur Wardens are fated to catch deviants The system is self-consistent if you don't think too hard The Uncomfortable Truth : If Wardens are fated to catch deviants, are deviants fated to deviate? If so, is punishment just? They couldn't help it. If not, then Fate doesn't determine everything. And the whole system is in question. Most Wardens don't think about this. The ones who do either leave the Order or become its most zealous members\u2014doubling down to escape the doubt. The Selection Problem The Order recruits based on pattern. Wardens tend to have patterns that include: Duty-Drive (obligation) Hunt-Path (pursuit) Chain-Bond (service) Threshold-Death (violence-adjacent mortality) These patterns create good enforcers. They also create people predisposed to: Following orders without question Pursuing targets with obsessive focus Accepting hierarchical authority Being comfortable with violence The Order selects for zealotry. This is intentional. An Order full of questioners wouldn't function. The Attunement Trap Once attuned, Wardens can't really leave. Pattern-Lock means they'll feel wrong doing anything else Resonance means they'll feel deviations everywhere they go Connection means The Attendance is always watching Life-Debt means they're already dying; might as well serve The Order doesn't need to threaten defectors. The attunement is the chain. Walk away, and you spend your shortened life feeling wrong about everything, with something patient watching your failure. Some walk away anyway. They don't last long. Public Perception Among the Faithful Wardens are holy warriors. Protectors of cosmic order. Stern but necessary. You thank them for their service even as you hope never to meet one. Among the Pattern-Privileged Wardens are useful tools. They keep the system running, enforce the rules that benefit the privileged. Occasionally inconvenient when they enforce rules without regard for status\u2014but usually manageable. Among the Pattern-Constrained Wardens are terror. They arrive, they accuse, they judge. Your word against theirs. Your pattern against The Loom's prediction. You're guilty before investigation begins because your pattern says you should be guilty. Among Practitioners Wardens are occupational hazard. Every practitioner of the Five Arts operates in gray zones. The Order is always watching. The question isn't whether you're violating something\u2014it's whether you're violating something they care about this month. The Order and the Elsewhere The Uncomfortable Parallels The Warden attunement looks, to outside observers, remarkably like a pact. Exchange of something (pattern-lock) for power Ongoing connection to an external entity Shortened lifespan Guidance that feels like your own thoughts Difficulty leaving the relationship The Order insists this is different: The Attendance is divine, not demonic Attunement serves Fate, not a faction's agenda Wardens maintain free will (they just choose correctly) The cost is sacrifice, not transaction Critics note: \"Divine\" and \"Elsewhere\" aren't mutually exclusive Agenda opacity doesn't mean agenda absence \"Choosing correctly\" and \"compulsion\" look the same from outside Sacrifice and transaction are both exchanges The Accountants Theory Some scholars note that The Attendance behaves remarkably like The Accountants\u2014the Elsewhere faction obsessed with debts, ledgers, and balance. Pattern-enforcement ensures debts are paid Deviation-correction maintains balanced ledgers The Loom's predictions are contracts reality must honor Wardens are collection agents If true, this means: The entire Orthodox system serves an Elsewhere agenda Wardens are pact-bound and don't know it The Order is the largest Elsewhere cult in existence \"Fate\" is a brand name for a specific faction's influence This theory is heresy. It's also unfalsifiable. And it keeps certain people awake at night.

If so, is punishment just? They couldn't help it. If not, then Fate doesn't determine everything. And the whole system is in question. Most Wardens don't think about this.
