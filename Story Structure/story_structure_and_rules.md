## Prologue & Epilogue Consideration

- Always review whether a prologue or epilogue would enhance the story, even for short stories or standalones. They are not required, but should be automatically considered before finalizing the outline.

## Multi-POV Lane Management & POV Death

- In series or sagas with multiple POVs, each POV should be treated as a "lane"—a narrative thread that tells a particular side of the story.
- If a POV dies, there should be a clear structure for the process: the lane continues, but the POV is replaced by a character from their orbit who has been present in previous scenes.
- Multiple POVs in a given lane can die and be replaced across a series, maintaining continuity and thematic resonance.
## Additional Storytelling Rule

- While every story should have 5 parts, chapters and scenes within each part must remain organic and flexible. There should never be a rigid scaffolding of chapters per part or scenes per chapter. Structure should always serve the best possible storytelling and narrative, adapting to the needs of the story and characters.
# General Story Structure & Rules

## Deep Structure Enhancements

### Motivation Tracking
- For each part, summarize major motivation shifts for main and key supporting characters. Note what changes, why, and what new stakes or conflicts arise.

### Reader Experience Checkpoints
- At the end of each part, add a note: What should the reader feel, suspect, or want next?

### Theme and Motif Evolution
- Track how core themes and motifs evolve, subvert, or pay off in each part. Note any transformation or new meaning.

### Subplot Integration
- For each subplot, rate its integration (1–5) with the main plot per part. Briefly justify low scores and flag for revision.

### Antagonist/Obstacle Tracking
- Summarize antagonist/obstacle goals, actions, and changes per part. Note how their arc evolves and impacts the protagonist.

### Payoff Satisfaction Review
- After each major payoff, review: Was it surprising, inevitable, and emotionally satisfying? Note any issues or flag for revision.
