## Series Arc Completion Rules


- When outlining a series, the outline should detail each book as a part of a major arc unless the series is episodic in nature.
- For a trilogy, each book should function as an act of a three-act story.
- For a quartet, each book should serve as an act from a four-act story.
- For a five-book saga, each book should follow the corresponding part from the established five-part structure.
- For longer series, consider mapping each book to a major arc or act, ensuring narrative cohesion and progression.
