# World Concept Draft

In a world where metaphysics is bureaucracy and fate is currency, society is ruled by four rival Ministries—Desire, Signal, Strategy, and Proof—each enforcing a different law of reality. Every citizen’s destiny is inscribed in a living pattern, shaping their social class, credit, and opportunity, but interpretation is a market: patterns can be forged, misread, or cosmetically altered.

Industry and magic run on the residue of death, a cheap and powerful fuel that poisons the world’s commons. The cost of every action, contract, or spell is tallied and offloaded—no private gain comes without public consequence. Major choices tighten or loosen the threads of fate, but only the gravest acts are truly irreversible.

Attention and belief are scarce resources, manipulated by the Ministry of Signal to render reality itself. The Ministry of Proof polices what counts as knowledge, demanding rigorous evidence and denying easy prophecy. The Ministry of Strategy enforces contracts and equilibria, while the Ministry of Desire manages the baseline of wants and temptations, quarantining luxuries that threaten social order.

Justice is the world’s central fracture: one side claims order and merit are fate, the other fights for autonomy and dignity against the tyranny of prediction. Espionage, corruption, and jurisdictional knife-fights are the norm, as ministries overlap and ancient ruins hint at a time when the laws of reality were set.

## Core World Laws (Canon & Dials)

**Core Pillars (Always True):**
1. Pattern Residue (death) fuels magic/industry—cheap, powerful, toxic.
2. Fate patterns drive caste, credit, and opportunity—interpreted, manipulated, never perfect.
3. Ministries (Desire, Signal, Strategy, Proof) enforce metaphysical laws—jurisdictional overlap, corruption, and rivalry.
4. Identification limits: knowledge/prophecy/divination require valid “instruments” and proof—no handwaving.
5. Externalities always bite: all costs spill into the commons, no private magic without public price.

**High-Yield Dials (With Safeguards):**
- Opportunity-cost threading: only major choices are irreversible; most tighten/loosen fate threads.
- Tradable future-self contracts: binding, but with legal “minimum agency” floors and reaffirmation.
- Attention/belief as reality-shaping: strongest in public/contested domains, private spaces mostly stable.
- Math (mechanism design, equilibria) enforced when conditions are met—wobbly if not.
- Justice/equality as ideological fracture: order vs. autonomy, fate vs. agency.

## Ministries (Mandates, Tools, Enemies)

**Ministry of Desire**
Mandate: Baselines, Temptation, Identity (police reference-point stability, not morality)
Signature Tools: Baseline Stamps, Temptation Quarantine Orders
Natural Enemy: Signal

**Ministry of Signal**
Mandate: Rendering, Attention, Persuasion (control what’s legible/visible)
Signature Tools: Render Licenses, Blur Warrants
Natural Enemy: Proof

**Ministry of Strategy**
Mandate: Commitment, Contracts, Equilibria (enforce incentives, internalize spillovers)
Signature Tools: Future-Self Instruments, Equilibrium Injunctions
Natural Enemy: Desire

**Ministry of Proof**
Mandate: Identification, Admissibility, Causal Claims (certify what counts as knowledge)
Signature Tools: Instrument Seals, Bounds Decrees
Natural Enemy: Everyone

**Overlaps:**
- Standing tribunals and task forces for each ministry pair (espionage, bureaucracy, and recurring cast gold).

## Aesthetic & Setting Backbone

- Primary: Arcane Bureaucracy + Fate-Caste Dystopia
- Secondary: Cold War Espionage
- Accent: Necro-Industrial Gothic (industry runs on quantified costs)
- Landmark: Polar Calibration Ruins (mythic, ancient, possibly world-shaping)
