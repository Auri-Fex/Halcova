### Pattern Residue + Alchemy (energy layer)

* **Pattern Residue** is raw, dangerous potential released by death (and sometimes by engineered “near-death” events in the black market—yes, grim).
* **Alchemy** refines it into usable formats:
  * **Cells** (sealed cartridges for lamps, engines, wards)
  * **Inks** (for stamped contracts, labels, ledgers)
  * **Catalysts** (for fast activations / emergency surge)
  * **Scrubbers** (partial cleanup—never complete)
* **Metaphysical pollution:** burning Residue increases commons-harm: brittleness, cognitive blight, institutional rot, and “ledger blooms” (public bads) unless actively mitigated.

This gives you classic arcane-punk: pipes, gauges, cartridges, filters, counterfeit seals, and neighborhoods with different “air quality” of reality.

## How Residue plugs into the five systems (without turning them into future-echoes)

### 1) Variancecraft (Tail Transfer + Outlier Culling)
* **Residue role:** provides the *energy to compress variance* hard and fast (industrial-grade “certainty presses”).
* **What doesn’t change:** you still pay the statistical bill:
  * **Tail Transfer** becomes more violent and more targetable when Residue is used (villains aim disasters).
  * **Outlier Culling** becomes mechanized: alchemical “sorting” tools that quietly prune extremes (people vanish into the tail).
* **Arcane-punk artifacts:** variance mills, probability dampers, “tail vents” (illegal—dump catastrophe into someone else’s district).

### 2) Incentive Hexing (Collateral Binding + Punishment Escrow)
* **Residue role:** powers enforcement infrastructure: seals that don’t fade, oath-sirens, escrow vaults, penalty automata.
* **What doesn’t change:** the moral horror stays mandatory:
  * **Collateral Binding** is the anchor that makes the threat real.
  * **Punishment Escrow** is the fuel of credibility—Residue just keeps the machinery running.
* **Arcane-punk artifacts:** escrow engines that *must* discharge on schedule; penalty meters; collateral brands activated by Residue current.

### 3) Attention Butchery (Attention Tithes + Grief Theft)
* **Residue role:** amplification and broadcast. Residue-powered horns, lamps, and “chorus rigs” let a performance harvest attention at city scale.
* **What doesn’t change:** the spell still consumes real human attention and/or grief capacity. Residue just makes the harvest efficient and portable.
* **Arcane-punk artifacts:** resonance stages, street-lantern arrays that “tune” crowds, grief condensers (contraband), attention batteries that feel like dopamine drip feeds.

### 4) Trait Theft (Calibration Trials + Invariance Break)
* **Residue role:** powers the clinics and the measurement engines—stress chambers, standardization vats, transfer needles, compliance rigs.
* **What doesn’t change:** you still need:
  * **Calibration Trials** (suffering-as-validity)
  * **Invariance Break** (flattening people/cultures so traits transfer cleanly)
* **Arcane-punk artifacts:** trait centrifuges, standardization masks, “model rooms” where everyone must live the same week to become comparable.

### 5) Confounding Rot (Instrument Burn + Label-Swap Tithe + optional Confounder Seeding)
* **Residue role:** accelerant and contamination carrier. Residue smoke, ink, or runoff makes rot spread farther and stick longer.
* **What doesn’t change:** you still must pay the up-front epistemic vandalism:
  * **Instrument Burn** (you destroy a real tool of knowing)
  * **Label-Swap Tithe** (systematic misclassification injected)
  * **Confounder Seeding** (optional: make a hidden cause real)
* **Arcane-punk artifacts:** ash-ink that corrupts ledgers, mislabeled cartridge batches, “instrument furnaces” that burn standards out of reality.

## One clean coherence rule (so the setting stays sharp)

**Residue can power scale and speed, but it cannot waive a system’s core cost.**

* Want a bigger Attention Butchery working? Add Residue to broadcast it wider—but you still owe attention-years and/or grief.
* Want more stable Incentive Hex? Residue keeps the escrow machine running—but you still owe collateral + escrow discharge.
* Want faster Variance compression? Residue drives the press—but tail/outlier payment still lands.

This preserves the academic “constraint truth” and prevents Residue from becoming an all-purpose “mana handwave.”

## The metaphysical ecology adjustment (to make Residue feel alive)

Residue doesn’t just sit in barrels; it attracts and spawns “industrial spirits” that create arcane-punk hazards:

* **Residue Eaters** (cleanup guild pets): consume small leaks, but become dangerous if overfed.
* **Bloom Moths**: appear where the Commons Ledger is overdue; their presence predicts a public-bad eruption.
* **Seal Rust**: a creeping phenomenon where Residue exposure corrodes contracts, labels, and measurement tools—perfect bridge between industry and Confounding Rot.

These make “pollution” narratively visible.
