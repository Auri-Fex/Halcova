# Conlang Construction Rules

## Overview

This document defines the systematic process for creating vocabulary in the constructed language (conlang) for the Dartboard world. Every word must pass through this complete process to ensure consistency and linguistic authenticity.

## Universal Human 5-Name Charter

### Default 5-name sequence

1. **Birth Name**
2. **Chosen Section**
3. **Line Acquisition Prefix**
4. **Line Stem**
5. **Fate Name**

---

### 1) Birth Name

A primary personal identifier assigned at birth (or discovery, for foundlings). This name is culturally “straightforward” and typically stable, though some cultures may permit changes after major life events.

---

### 2) Chosen Section

This slot represents a socially acknowledged self-identifier that can emerge later in life.

#### Options for how this works across worlds

* **Chosen Name**: selected by the person at maturity, after a rite, or after a milestone.
* **Middle Name (optional)**: a secondary personal name that may be:
  * self-selected,
  * bestowed by family/community,
  * assigned by institution (school, temple, state),
  * ceremonial only,
  * or used as the *only* “later-life” name in worlds where people do not pick names.
* **World variant:** a culture may *forbid* self-chosen names but *allow* assigned middle names (or multiple middle names), which still live in this same slot.

#### Invariant rule

The Chosen Section can contain:
* just a chosen name,
* just a middle name,
* or both (culture-dependent),
  but it always functions as the “later identity layer” separate from lineage and fate.

---

### 3–4) Line Name Unit (hyphenated)

This is always written and treated as a single hyphenated unit, composed of two truths:

* **(3) Acquisition Prefix** = *how the person holds the line*
* **(4) Line Stem** = *which line they hold*

#### Core invariants

* The **Line Stem** is the “surname-ish” identity anchor (family/house/clan/branch), regardless of genre or setting.
* The **Acquisition Prefix** is a **closed semantic category** (the same meanings across all worlds; only the sound/orthography changes).
* A person has **one active acquisition prefix** at a time in daily use (histories can be recorded elsewhere, but speech stays readable).

---

### 3) Line Acquisition Prefix categories

Choose a stable set and keep the meaning constant across all worlds. Cultures differ in which they recognize, which are stigmatized, and what rights they grant.

#### A) Standard acquisition (full belonging pathways)

* **Born-of**: default biological claim
* **Recognized**: claim granted or confirmed later (legitimation/acknowledgement/restoration)
* **Taken-in**: adoption / full transfer into the line
* **Married-into**: affinal claim via marriage (temporary or permanent by culture)

#### B) Non-transfer upbringing (connection without full transfer)

* **Fostered-by**: raised by the line, without automatic full standing

#### C) Institutional replacement (line held by oath or role)

* **Sworn-to**: oath-family, order-line, priesthood-line, military-line, etc. (may replace or override birth-line publicly)

#### D) Contested claim (line used without full recognition)

* **Natural-of**: blood connection without formal standing (useful for bastardy/illegitimacy models)
* **Claimed-of**: self-asserted claim without verification
* **Rumored-of**: socially attributed claim the person does not assert as fact
* **Unknown**: records missing/erased; placeholder until resolved

#### E) Severed standing (acknowledged connection, rights denied or surrendered)

* **Exiled-from**: expelled by the line; connection acknowledged, rights stripped
* **Disowned-of**: publicly revoked claim; harsher social/legal weight
* **Renounced-of**: voluntarily surrendered rights while retaining historical connection

---

### Prefix change rules (portable, setting-agnostic)

Prefixes only change at defined life-events (legal, ritual, social, or institutional). Recommended universal event types:

* **Recognition event**: moves a person from contested/limited standing to recognized standing
* **Adoption/transfer event**: changes the pathway by which the line is held
* **Oath event**: institutional line replaces or supersedes other claims (publicly or entirely)
* **Marriage event**: affinal line becomes primary (if that culture uses it)
* **Severance event**: exile, disownment, or renunciation converts the prefix to a severed category
* **Restoration event**: a severed prefix returns to recognized standing

Invariant: changes are **not casual**; they require a culturally legible trigger.

---

### 4) Line Stem

The stable identifier of the line itself.

#### What a Line Stem can represent (world-flexible)

* family/house/clan identity
* root-ancestor identity
* branch/household identity
* place-founded identity
* trade/totem/mythic origin identity
* legal inheritance identity

Invariant: whatever its origin, the stem remains the “which line” anchor, distinct from the acquisition prefix.

---

### 5) Fate Name

A universally present, non-surname identity layer that expresses what the person *carries* (burden, role, omen, calling, prophecy-slot, etc.).

#### Fate invariants

* Everyone has one, even if it is euphemized, sealed, dormant, or private.
* Fate always has:
  * a **Source** (where it comes from: family mantle, omen system, institutional bestowal, prophecy, consequence, etc.)
  * a **Bind** (what it demands: obligation, constraint, role, pull, risk, or cost)
* Fate does **not** change casually; it can activate, clarify, compound, be fulfilled, or be broken—each requiring defined triggers.

#### Fate category options (keep meanings stable; swap aesthetics per world)

* **Mantle** (carried role that can repeat across generations)
* **Debt** (owed burden or inherited obligation)
* **Oath** (binding vow or geas-like constraint)
* **Mark** (omen/scar/signifier of circumstance)
* **Calling** (directional pull toward a path)
* **Curse/Blessing** (imposed fortune or condition)
* **Key** (prophecy-slot / problem-solver designation)

#### Fate–Line interaction rule (recommended invariant)

Whether a person can inherit or publicly claim a family Fate Mantle can depend on their **acquisition prefix category** (full, limited, contested, severed), allowing consistent tension across cultures without changing the name structure.

## Step 1: Three-Language Foundation

Each word is built using three real-world languages in distinct roles:

### 1.1 Root Language (Base)

**Purpose**: Provides the semantic foundation for the word.

**Process**:
- Identify the concept to be named
- Find the translation in the designated Root Language
- The root can be derived from:
  - **Direct translation**: The literal word for the concept
  - **Metaphorical translation**: A word/phrase that captures the essence metaphorically
  - **Symbolic translation**: A word representing symbolic association with the concept
  - **Synonymous translation**: A related word or synonym that carries appropriate connotations

**Output**: A root word or root phrase

### 1.2 Affix Language (Emphasis)

**Purpose**: Creates affixes that modify and emphasize the root word, adding flavor and nuance.

**Process**:
- Use the same root concept (not the translated word from 1.1)
- Find the translation in the designated Affix Language
- Derive an affix (prefix or suffix) from this translation
- **Critical Rule**: Create multiple affix variations for each root concept to avoid repetitive endings and create linguistic variety

**Affix Variations Should Include**:
- At least 2-3 suffix options per common concept
- At least 1-2 prefix options where appropriate
- Shortened forms for compound words
- Formal vs. informal variants where applicable

**Output**: One or more affixes to attach to the root

### 1.3 Mutation Language (Transformation)

**Purpose**: Provides letter mutation rules to transform the combined root+affix into something new.

**Process**:
- Take the combined root+affix word
- Apply letter mutations based on the Mutation Language's phonetic patterns
- **Critical Rule**: Every word must have AT LEAST TWO letters mutated

**Mutation Types**:
- Vowel shifts (a→e, i→u, etc.)
- Consonant shifts (k→g, t→d, s→z, etc.)
- Letter additions
- Letter substitutions based on Mutation Language phonetics

**Output**: A mutated word that feels distinct from both source languages

---

## Step 2: Molting (Temporal Compression)

**Purpose**: Simulate natural linguistic evolution—how an ancient, archaic word would condense over centuries of common use.

**Process**:
- Assume the Step 1 output is an "Old Form" of the word
- Apply compression as if the word has been spoken for generations:
  - Remove redundant syllables
  - Blend consonant clusters
  - Drop unstressed vowels
  - Simplify repeated sounds
  - Shorten overly long words (target: 1-3 syllables for common words)

**Principles**:
- High-frequency words compress more
- Formal/ritual words may retain longer forms
- Technical terms compress less than everyday vocabulary

**Output**: A "Modern Form" of the word

---

## Step 3: Enunciation (Readability)

**Purpose**: Ensure the final word is simple to pronounce for English-speaking readers.

**Process**:
- Review the molted word for pronunciation clarity
- Apply adjustments:
  - Break up unpronounceable consonant clusters
  - Ensure vowel placement allows natural flow
  - Avoid sounds that don't exist in English (or provide clear approximations)
  - Test by reading aloud—if you stumble, simplify

**Guidelines**:
- Prefer open syllables (consonant + vowel) where possible
- Avoid more than two consonants in sequence
- Ensure stress patterns are intuitive
- The word should be pronounceable on first read

**Output**: The final word, ready for use

## Complete Process Checklist

For every word converted:

- [ ] **Root**: Found translation/metaphor/symbol in Root Language
- [ ] **Affix**: Created affix from Affix Language (with variations documented)
- [ ] **Mutation**: Applied 2+ letter mutations from Mutation Language
- [ ] **Molting**: Compressed to simulate linguistic evolution
- [ ] **Enunciation**: Confirmed easy pronunciation for readers

## Language Set Selection

The three languages should be selected based on:

1. **Root Language**: Should have rich vocabulary for concepts central to the world (death, binding, fate, flesh, etc.)
2. **Affix Language**: Should have distinct phonetic character from the Root Language
3. **Mutation Language**: Should provide interesting consonant/vowel shift patterns

The selected language set should create words that feel:
- Consistent with each other (same world, same tongue)
- Distinct from real-world languages (clearly fantasy)
- Appropriate to the tone (dark fantasy, weight, consequence)
