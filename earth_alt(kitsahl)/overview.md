# Oracle Magitech Canon v1.0

Arcane-punk city world with 1860–70s silhouette tech, powered by mined Resonance crystals; prophecy emerges as engineered instrumentation and becomes the backbone of noir corruption and precrime.

## 1) Core Aesthetic and Tech Baseline

* The world *looks* and *moves* like the 1860s–70s: brass, glass, gauges, belts, rails, gaslight, printing, punched strips, telegraph logic, black powder weapons, soot and steam infrastructure.
* The divergence is power and control: **Resonanceworks** (glowing, humming arcane power) rises as a rival/successor to **Steamworks** (coal, boilers, pistons).
* Every major device has two tracks:
  * **Mundane version:** steam/clockwork/chemical/gas; cheap, rugged, ubiquitous.
  * **Arcane version:** resonance-fed, tuned materials; cleaner, denser power; requires calibration and is vulnerable to drift, interference, and fraud.

## 2) Resonance as an Engineered Power Phenomenon

* “Arcane power” is treated as  **Resonance** : a patterned energy that can be induced in certain matter, stored as stable standing patterns, and released as work (light, motion, heat, computation).
* Resonance has engineering realities: harmonics, interference, drift, load limits, tuning recipes, shielding needs, and identifiable failure signatures.
* Visually and tactically: conduit sight-windows show  **pulsing glow** ; instruments  **hum** ; overloads flare; instability produces jittering light and “tooth-ache” hum.

## 3) Crystal Economy and Natural Sources

Crystals are **natural** and  **mined/harvested** —no event-created sources in canon (for now).

### Primary natural sources

1. **Slate Veins** (hard-rock seams): consistent output; main source of stable grid crystals.
2. **Karst Cathedral Pockets** (cavern geodes): clean civic-grade and occasional naturally ideal geometry for precision work.
3. **Hot-Sinter Terraces** (spring terraces): harvested layers; cheap industrial feedstock; high variance.
4. **Glassreef Beds** (coastal nodules): dredged/dived; moisture and salt complicate storage; inclusion-rich experimental material.

### Grading

* **S-grade (Civic):** stable, low noise; lamps and municipal loads.
* **A-grade (Industrial):** higher output; moderate drift; factories, rail repeaters.
* **O-grade (Oracle):** rare, sensitive; licensed, serialized, and tightly controlled.

### Refining & tuning

* Cutting geometry + etched collars + thermal cycling “set” standing patterns.
* Over-setting makes a crystal stable but blunt; under-setting makes it sensitive but twitchy.
* Refining produces **resonant slag** (hazardous byproduct), which fuels sabotage/jammer tech.

## 4) Resonanceworks Infrastructure: The Trust Grid

### Distribution

* Power moves through  **Resonance mains** : brass-rib conduits with glass “sight sections” used for inspection, photography, and fraud.
* Grid includes a controlled bleed path (“damp line”) for excess pattern-energy; criminals tap it for “free power,” destabilizing wards.

### Harmonic Houses (substations)

Standard functional spaces:

* Bank Hall (crystal stacks in cradles)
* Mechanical Governor Gallery (escapements/flywheels/dampers)
* Meter Office (billing + trace custody)
* Quiet Bay (shielding + calibration, access-controlled)
* Slag Vault (dangerous byproduct storage)

### Metering = law

Three meter types:

1. **Line meters** (block/ward draw)
2. **Premise meters** (buildings)
3. **Instrument meters** (licensed devices: oracles, repeaters, regulators)

Meters produce **Load Traces** (paper strip/plate): draw + stability + drift marks. These become courtroom exhibits, insurance leverage, and blackmail.

### Systemic grid corruption

* **Brown-glow as policing:** destabilize poor wards → instruments drift → enforcement claims “chaos is inherent.”
* **Inspection capture:** tuners sign off on convenient drift.
* **Authorized repair fraud:** trace plates and meter parts get swapped under “maintenance.”
* **Quiet Bay cartel:** calibration access becomes a bribery choke point.

## 5) Oracle Constructs: What They Are and How They Work

### Prime rule

Oracles don’t “know the future.” They  **measure forecast-pressure** —how strongly the world is already committing to an outcome. Outputs are instrumental, not mystical.

### Physical build stack

* **Frame (mundane engineering):** gimbals, escapements, dampers; determines stability, response time, and drift.
* **Resonator core (lens):** tuned materials set the domain and bias (what it can read well, what it misreads).
* **Driver (power):** grid tap or cell bank; stability matters.
* **Recorder (period output):** ticker tape, punched strip, engraved plate, telegraph bursts, dial arrays with confidence bands.

### Consumables and targeting

* **Fuel:** resonance charge (grid or cells) plus maintenance inputs.
* **Anchors:** physical samples to couple forecasting (token, signature, seal wax, hair, location shaving, organizational mark).
* Anchors require chain-of-custody; planted anchors are the noir equivalent of planted weapons.

### Oracle outputs (Forecast Sheet)

Every forecast includes:

1. Outcome class
2. Time window
3. Vector (location/cluster map + linkage hints)
4. Confidence score + drift note

Oracles do not deliver perfect names with certainty; they deliver  **actionable risk geometry** .

### Failure modes (canonical)

* Anchor poisoning / planting
* Domain blindness
* Reflex collapse (measurement changes behavior)
* Drift after heavy use
* Adversarial tactics (decoy events, chaff trades, route poisoning)

## 6) “Wild O” (unregistered oracle-grade) and Smuggling

Wild O exists as rare geology and rare geometry; it’s illegal because it enables unlicensed precision.

### Main channels

* Side-cutting at legal mines (skim before assay)
* Frontier pockets outside Trust reach
* Refinery “upgrade swaps” (legal exterior, illegal core)

### Smuggling routes and covers

* Rail consignments labeled as glass/insulators/printing plates
* Canal barges with false bilges
* “Medical” shipments / coffin crates
* Sleeved inside boiler tubes to mask signature

### Investigation tells

* Chime-test stability
* Seal-paste discoloration under arc-lamp
* Density/weight mismatch
* Subtle “static pressure” sensation near unshielded Wild O (trained tuners notice)

## 7) The Six Oracle Domains (and why prophecy isn’t omniscience)

Each domain is a distinct build family with its own bias, failure mode, and tamper playbook.

1. **Violence** — imminent harm clusters; easy to spoof via decoy cascades and anchor planting.
2. **Fire & Failure** — infrastructure stress; sabotaged by maintenance masking and load spoofing.
3. **Crowd Motion** — riots/strikes/panic routes; bulletin feedback loops; shaped via signal flooding and kiosk swaps.
4. **Fraud & Exchange** — bribery/smuggling/insurance fraud; blurred by laundering fog and chaff trades.
5. **Flight** — evasion likelihood and route geometry; fails when targets act irrationally; poisoned via staged obstructions and local blackouts.
6. **Witness** — who will testify/recant/vanish; coercion paradox; corrupted via leverage injection and reputation forgery.

## 8) Precrime: Bureau of Preemptions

Forecasts are  **probable cause** , not proof, enabling Minority Report tension without plot-breaking certainty.

### Warrant ladder

* **Green (≤59):** monitor only
* **Amber (60–74):** surveillance, prep, limited searches
* **Red (75–89):** expedited search/seizure; temporary detention with defined harm + window
* **Black (90+):** emergency interdiction; closures, forced entry, mass containment; reviewed after

### Mandatory attachments (paper becomes plot)

* Original forecast strip/plate/log
* Calibration state + drift note
* Anchor chain-of-custody
* Interdiction plan
* Receipt log

### Bureau cheating patterns (canonical rot)

* Drift laundering (use dirty runs, file clean certs)
* Anchor laundering (swap “legal” anchors into the record)
* Window squeezing (relabel urgency)
* Domain substitution (shop forecasts to justify raids)
* Notice stacking (composite risk to escalate class)
* Kiosk shaping (create crowd pressure, then cite it)
* Receipt editing (act first, backfill later)

### Oversight triangle

* **Trust audit** (meter traces, licensed draw)
* **Bureau review board** (warrants/receipts)
  Both sometimes honest, often captured—forming constant pressure between Bureau ↔ Trust ↔ Oracle Houses.

## 9) Ward Archetypes (repeatable city map)

1. **Glow Ward:** stable power; high oracle reliability; clean corruption and surgical violence.
2. **Soot Ward:** steam-heavy; patchy resonance; drift excuses; street violence and rackets.
3. **Static Ward:** interference; oracle-dark deals; tech misfires; meeting/handoff territory.
4. **Dock Ward:** salt noise; smuggling; weird domain performance; brutal short fights.
5. **Administrative Ward:** best shielding; highest reliability; politically edited forecasts; fast raids.

## 10) Devices and Combat in Practice (how fights look)

### Three grounding rules

* Resonance tech is powerful but temperamental.
* Steam tech is ugly but reliable.
* Oracle-adjacent activity creates receipts (meter traces, drift marks).

### Period weapons remain primary

Revolvers, carbines, shotguns, batons, knives, black-powder smoke, gaslight glare, factory hazards.

### Arcane-punk field tech (same silhouette, new effects)

* **Resonance sidearms:** tuned consistency/higher punch; drain cells; leave harmonic signatures.
* **Arc batons:** stun compliance tools; perfect for abuse and lying reports.
* **Damp charges:** localized detune; arc-lamps dim; field instruments stutter; traceable dead-band.
* **Seal-cuffs:** disrupt devices; stop suspects using tuned gear; easily abused.
* **Mirrorpane flash:** short-range bloom; trips meters; reveals positions.

### Constructs in the field (golem lane)

* **Warrant Hounds:** track anchors, pin suspects; confused by Static; corroded by Dock conditions.
* **Doorwrights:** precise breaching constructs; leave stamped receipts; overforce becomes plausible deniability.
* **Meter-scribes:** portable recorders that print “lawful draw” traces; swapping plates = planting evidence.

### Combat tactics that make it noir

* Detune a room → arc gear fails → steel comes out.
* Force a load spike → lamps brighten → hounds run clean → escape routes narrow.
* Anchor bait mid-fight to misdirect tracking.
* Steam vents/fog to collapse Witness usefulness and hide movement.

## 11) Origin Story: the “Penicillin” discovery of Oracles

* Roughly a century ago, mined crystals begin powering light, motion, and telegraph repeaters, creating a parallel arcane industrial revolution without changing the mechanical silhouette.
* The first oracle emerges accidentally from a practical safety instrument (stress/load register) when a wrong binder/tuning recipe causes the device to cross from physical stress to causal stress—forecast-pressure becomes measurable.
* Once recognized, the breakthrough is standardized:
  * anchor handling + custody
  * domain lenses
  * recorder standards
  * licensing and metering
    Oracles become a system, then a bureaucracy, then a corruption machine.


## Referencing

This appendix extends **Oracle Magitech Canon v1.0** (locked in this chat) with the “Alien-feel” branch: industrial dread, rare alien-like creatures, and facility pressure-cooker setpieces—while keeping oracles/prophecy as the core noir engine.

---

# Appendix A: Industrial Dread Mode

How the setting sustains an “Aliens” mood without becoming an alien-hunt story, and without replacing oracle-focused neo-noir as the primary genre.

## A1) Genre Contract

### Primary genre (always-on)

**Oracle-focused neo-noir:** corruption, lies, leverage, paper trails, and precrime abuse.

* Forecasts are probable cause, not proof.
* Anchors, calibration states, meter traces, and receipts drive investigations.
* Institutions (Trust, Bureau, Oracle Houses) compete, collude, and scapegoat.

### Secondary tone layer (situational)

**Industrial dread:** claustrophobia, failing instrumentation, blue-collar competence, and corporate indifference.

* Used as a pressure cooker for key sequences (infrastructure descents, blackouts, quarantines).
* The threat complicates evidence and morality; it does not replace motive and culpability.

## A2) The “Alien Feel” Translation Layer

The setting produces “alien” vibes by making the **city function like a ship** and the  **system behave like an indifferent predator** .

### Core sensory pillars

* Tight industrial spaces: conduits, crawlspaces, vaults, catwalks, boiler rooms, wet basements, dock culverts.
* Power as a heartbeat: conduit sight-windows pulse; lamps hum; drift shows as flicker and jitter.
* Bad information at worst moments: field devices stutter, confidence bands widen, comms degrade.
* Relentless pressure: countdown windows, dwindling charge, “brown-glow minutes,” lockdowns.
* Corporate betrayal: “safety reroutes,” “policy escalations,” and “audit decisions” that endanger crews.

## A3) Creature Policy: Infrastructure Ecology, Not Center-Stage Monsters

### Canon rule

Alien-like creatures (or construct-fauna analogues) exist as **industrial wildlife** attracted to Resonance infrastructure:

* They prefer active mains, Harmonic Houses, slag vaults, dock trenches, and flooded service runs.
* Most stories show **signs and consequences** more than full encounters.

### On-page frequency guideline

* Most cases: 0–1 direct encounter, brief and scene-ending.
* Arc episodes: one full facility sequence where dread forces confessions, betrayals, and hard choices.

## A4) What Makes Them “Alien” Without Xenomorphs

* Non-mammal sensing: harmonics, vibration gradients, heat/power fields.
* Unfamiliar lifecycle: molts, mineralized shedding, phase states, swarm behavior, tunnel nesting.
* Indirect lethality: they kill via detuning, panic, pressure ruptures, falls, seizures, drowning, blackout cascades.
* Hard rules: each threat has consistent behaviors investigators can learn and exploit.

## A5) Dread Comes From Procedures (and Procedure Abuse)

Industrial dread is created when **protocols are followed** and people still die—or when protocol is weaponized.

### Canon “procedure-as-horror” mechanisms

* Trust initiates a “stability reroute” that traps people in a dead corridor.
* Bureau escalates a Notice class mid-incident to justify force or seize a target item.
* Oracle House refuses calibration keys unless paid, while a ward flickers toward blackout.
* Meter traces and receipts become contested objects—evidence can be edited, swapped, or destroyed.

## A6) Replace the Motion Tracker With Meter Traces

The setting’s equivalent of the Aliens motion tracker is  **live instrumentation** :

* Load trace jitter spikes
* dead-band signatures after damp charges
* arc-lantern flicker patterns
* field oracle confidence bands widening
* abrupt drift marks in portable strips

Tension comes from watching paper/plates print “bad news” in real time, with imperfect fidelity.

## A7) Episode Spine: Oracle Noir With Industrial Dread Overlay

A reusable structure that keeps prophecy/noir central while delivering Aliens-grade pressure:

1. **Notice arrives** (and smells wrong: drift, custody oddity, edited trace).
2. **Investigation** finds motive (money, leverage, politics).
3. **Descent** into infrastructure to secure hard proof (original strip, meter plate, anchor).
4. **Interference event** (brown-glow, damp charge, static bloom, comms degrade).
5. **Brief encounter** (environmental lethality, fast escalation).
6. **Institutional betrayal** (“policy” decision endangers the team).
7. **Extraction** with proof-or-death stakes.
8. **Noir ending** : truth survives only if someone pays a cost to leak it.

## A8) Canon “Alien Feel” Constraint: Threats Exploit Grid Weaknesses

To keep dread coherent and non-random, threats reliably worsen when the city “does what it’s built to do.”

Examples of canonical exploit logic:

* Active mains attract or empower the threat → turning power on can make it worse.
* Dock humidity and salt noise degrade seals → arc gear fails first near water.
* Static wards blind oracles → Bureau loses certainty and overreacts.
* Slag contamination corrupts meter traces → evidence itself becomes untrustworthy.

## A9) Why This Doesn’t Dilute the Noir

The creatures are not the plot. They are:

* an **excuse** institutions use (“natural hazard”) to bury truth,
* a **tool** corrupt actors weaponize (introduce infestations, trigger blackouts),
* a **complication** that forces decisions under pressure,
* a **physical reason** why “perfect prediction” never exists in practice.

The real villain remains the human system: who controls the hum, who edits the paper, who profits from fear.
