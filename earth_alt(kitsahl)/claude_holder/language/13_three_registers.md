# The Three Registers of Sybari

**Definition**: Registers are varieties of language used in different social contexts

**Sybari's Three Registers**: Technical, Bureaucratic, Street

**Social Function**: Register marks speaker's class, education, access to power

---

## Overview Table

| Register | Speakers | Context | Evidentials | Grammar | Vocabulary |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Technical** | Tier 1-2 (elite) | Oracle Houses, universities | All required | Strict rules | Complex, specialized |
| **Bureaucratic** | Tier 2-3 (middle) | Bureau, government, business | Main verbs only | Standard | Formal, standardized |
| **Street** | Tier 4-5 (working) | Daily life, informal | Emphasis only | Mixed/simplified | Simple, Common-mixed |

---

## Technical Sybari

- Native speakers (raised with it)
- Perfect fluency
- Use as status marker

**Tier 2** (Professionals, University-educated):
- Learned in school
- High proficiency
- Use for work, formal contexts

**Context**:
- Oracle House operations
- Academic papers
- Scientific discourse
- High-level business
- Elite social gatherings

---

### Characteristics

- No contractions
- Complex compounds encouraged

**Grammar**:
- Strict SVO word order
- All evidentials required (every main verb)
- No article omission
- Formal subordination
- No sentence fragments

**Vocabulary**:
- Extensive technical terms
- Precise distinctions (drift vs flux vs cascade)
- Oracle-specific jargon
- Latin/Greek borrowings (probability, calibration)
- Indigenous roots acknowledged (in dictionaries, not speech)

---

### Example

**Written**:
"The nareta-kaeth-el im petaknul-designation-7 show-shen drift-kae-el excessive-mar during calibration-verification-process-shen at tem-designation 09:00."

**Pronunciation**:
[Careful, precise] "The nah-REH-tah-KAETH-el im peh-TAHK-nul-designation-seven show-shen DRIFT-kae-el excessive-mar during calibration-verification-process-shen at tem-designation oh-nine-hundred."

**Translation**:
"The oracle devices at Location 7 (formal designation) display (oracle confirms) excessive drift levels (witnessed) during the calibration verification process (oracle confirmed) at 09:00."

---

### Social Function

**Marker of**:
- Education (university training)
- Class (wealthy background)
- Professional status (oracle industry insider)
- Cultural capital (knows "proper" language)

**Access**:
- Universities (£50-200/year tuition)
- Private tutors
- Oracle House training programs
- **Exclusion**: Too expensive for working class

---

## Bureaucratic Sybari

### Who Speaks It

**Tier 2-3** (Middle management, civil servants):
- Bureau agents
- Mid-level oracle operators
- Government clerks
- Business professionals
- Teachers, lawyers

**Context**:
- Bureau reports
- Legal documents
- Official correspondence
- Business meetings
- Formal but not academic

---

### Characteristics

**Phonology**:
- Standard pronunciation
- Some reduction (glottal stops sometimes dropped)
- Clear but not pedantic
- Acceptable regional variation

**Morphology**:
- Standard affixes
- Some hyphens (formal documents)
- Occasional contractions (informal contexts)
- Moderate compounds

**Grammar**:
- Standard SVO
- Evidentials on main verbs (required)
- Some article omission (acceptable)
- Standard subordination
- Complete sentences (formal); fragments (informal memos)

**Vocabulary**:
- Standardized bureaucratic terms
- Common oracle terminology

- Less technical than Oracle House
- More formal than Street

---

### Example

**Written**:
"Subject detained-mar at 08:15 per nareta-kaeth forecast-shen showing vesh-probability 78% within 48-hour window-nareta. Processing complete-mar at detention-nul 11:00."

**Pronunciation**:
[Standard, efficient] "Subject detained-mar at oh-eight-fifteen per nareta-kaeth forecast-shen showing vesh-probability seventy-eight percent within forty-eight-hour window-nareta. Processing complete-mar at detention-nul eleven-hundred."

**Translation**:
"Subject detained (witnessed) at 08:15 per oracle forecast (oracle confirmed) showing 78% violence probability within 48-hour forecast window. Processing complete (witnessed) at detention facility at 11:00."

---

### Social Function

**Marker of**:
- Middle-class status
- Bureaucratic competence
- Government employment
- Professional literacy
- "Respectable" work

**Access**:
- Bureau training (job requirement)
- Business schools
- Technical colleges
- **Achievable**: Middle-class can afford

---

### Special Feature: Standardized Phrases

**Bureau has memorized formulas**:

**Arrest Report**:
- "Subject detained-mar at [time] per nareta-kaeth [number] forecast-shen"
- "Probability-kae [%] vesh-commission within [time] window-nareta"
- "No resistance offered-mar during process"

**Oracle Operators**:
- "Nareta-kaeth shows-shen [prediction]"
- "Drift-kae measured-mar at [%]"
- "Calibration verified-mar-shen at [time]"

**Legal**:
- "Testimony provided-mar regarding [event]"
- "Evidence consists-of [items]-mar"
- "Verdict determined-teth based-on [reasoning]"

**Effect**: Bureaucrats can function with moderate Sybari (memorized phrases cover 80% of job)

---

## Street Sybari

### Who Speaks It

**Tier 4-5** (Working class, poor):
- Factory workers
- Domestic servants
- Dock laborers
- Street vendors
- Unemployed

**Also**:
- Indigenous peoples (mixing traditional + Sybari)
- Immigrants (learning Sybari informally)
- Children (before formal education)

**Context**:
- Daily conversation
- Informal settings
- Resistance movements
- Underground gatherings

---

### Characteristics

**Phonology**:
- Rapid, reduced speech
- Vowels schwa-ize (unstressed → "uh")
- Consonants assimilate
- Glottal stops dropped
- Diphthongs simplified (ae → "eh")

**Morphology**:
- Simplified affixes (drop some)
- No hyphens
- Heavy contractions (gonna, ne-worry)
- Short compounds only
- Mix Sybari + Common morphology

**Grammar**:
- Mixed SVO/SOV (indigenous bleeding through)
- Evidentials optional (used for emphasis only)
- Articles from Common
- Code-switching mid-sentence
- Sentence fragments common

**Vocabulary**:
- Basic Sybari terms
- Heavy Common mixing
- Slang (vesh = trouble, not just violence)
- Simplified (kaeth = "oracle" generally)
- No technical jargon

---

### Example

**Spoken**:
"Kaeth broke again, yeah? Drift showing crazy high-mar, like 45%. Boss gonna be pissed-ath, probably blame us-petak. Typical-kel."

**Pronunciation**:
[Fast, casual] "KAETH broke 'gen, ya? Drift showing crazy high-mar, like forty-five. Boss gonna be pissed-ath, prob'ly blame us-petak. Typical-kel."

**Translation**:
"The oracle's broken again, right? Drift level is showing really high (I saw it) - like 45%. Boss is going to be angry (probably), he'll probably blame us (that's what I've heard happens). That's just how it is (established pattern)."

---

### Social Function

**Marker of**:
- Working-class status
- Lack of formal education
- Exclusion from power
- Resistance to elitism
- Authentic/"real" (vs. pretentious elite)

**Political Dimension**:
- Simplifying Sybari = rejection of European linguistic control
- Code-switching = assertion of hybrid identity
- Using -kel (traditional) = connecting to indigenous roots
- SOV word order (sometimes) = resistance through grammar

---

### Indigenous Variation

**Street Sybari among indigenous speakers** has special features:

**More -kel (traditional)**:
- Use ancestral evidential more frequently
- Marks connection to pre-colonial knowledge

**SOV sometimes used**:
- Object before verb (Kael'nir structure)
- Politically dangerous but happens
- "Corruption" from European view; reclamation from indigenous

**Forbidden vocabulary**:
- nareta-sacred (sacred prophecy)
- mora-kel-sacred (sacred ancestral truth)
- Using these in traditional ways = criminal offense

**Code-switching with Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali**:
- Mix indigenous language words
- Spoken secretly (illegal in public)

---

## Register Switching (Code-Switching)

### When People Switch Registers

**Upward** (Street → Bureaucratic → Technical):
- **Reason**: Job interview, court appearance, formal business
- **Effect**: Show competence, education, "respectability"
- **Challenge**: Working-class may lack fluency; can be marked as "trying too hard"

**Downward** (Technical → Bureaucratic → Street):
- **Reason**: Informal conversation, home life, expressing solidarity
- **Effect**: Show authenticity, relatability, reject elitism
- **Challenge**: Elite doing this seen as "slumming" or condescending

---

### Examples

**Middle-class oracle operator** (Tier 3):

**At work** (Bureaucratic):
"Nareta-kaeth shows-shen vesh-probability-kae 60% at petaknul-7."

**At home** (Street):
"Oracle says probably violence at District 7, yeah?"

**In court** (Bureaucratic, precise):
"Kael-mar the forecast-generation-process-shen at tem-designation specified-mar."

---

**Wealthy professional** (Tier 2):

**Oracle House meeting** (Technical):
"The drift-kae-el measured-mar during calibration-verification-process-shen indicate-teth systemic-resonance-degradation-nareta."

**Dinner party with friends** (Bureaucratic):
"The drift levels we measured suggest the system's going to degrade."

**Talking to servants** (Street):
"The kaeth's drifting bad, gonna need fixing."

---

## Register and Power

### Language as Gatekeeping

**Technical Sybari** = access to oracle industry
- Jobs require fluency
- Can't work at Oracle House without Technical proficiency
- **Effect**: Working class excluded

**Bureaucratic Sybari** = access to government jobs
- Bureau requires competence
- Civil service exams test Bureaucratic Sybari
- **Effect**: Moderate barrier (trainable but not easy)

**Street Sybari** = marked as uneducated
- Using Street register in formal contexts = disrespected
- Grammar "errors" (SOV, missing evidentials) = incompetent
- **Effect**: Linguistic discrimination

---

### The Prestige Hierarchy

**Most Prestigious**: Technical Sybari
- "Proper" language
- "Educated" speech
- "Scientific" precision

**Moderate Prestige**: Bureaucratic Sybari
- "Competent" language
- "Professional" speech
- "Standard" form

**Least Prestigious**: Street Sybari
- "Corrupted" language (European view)
- "Uneducated" speech
- "Primitive" mixing

**Indigenous Perspective**: "They call our surviving grammar 'corruption.' We call it resistance."

---

## Register Acquisition

### How People Learn Registers

**Technical Sybari**:
- **Childhood** (Tier 1): Native acquisition
- **University** (Tier 2): Formal instruction
- **Self-study** (Tier 3): Very difficult; rarely successful
- **Tier 4-5**: Effectively impossible (no access to resources)

**Bureaucratic Sybari**:
- **Job training**: Bureau teaches employees
- **Technical school**: Business/clerical programs
- **Apprenticeship**: Learn on the job
- **Self-study**: Possible with determination

**Street Sybari**:
- **Informal acquisition**: Pick up from community
- **Childhood**: Learn from family, peers
- **No formal instruction**: Develops organically

---

### Intergenerational Transmission

**Tier 1-2 families**:
- Speak Technical Sybari at home
- Children acquire fluency naturally
- Maintain linguistic privilege across generations

**Tier 3 families**:
- Parents use Bureaucratic at work, Street at home
- Children learn Street first, Bureaucratic in school
- Upward mobility requires Technical acquisition (difficult)

**Tier 4-5 families**:
- Speak Street Sybari or mostly Common
- Children have minimal Sybari exposure
- School doesn't teach it (Common used in working-class schools)
- **Cycle**: Linguistic exclusion perpetuates

---

## Register Mixing and Innovation

### Hybrid Forms

**Middle-class speech** often mixes registers:

"The kaeth-shen is showing-mar drift-kae high, so I'm thinking-ath we should recalibrate-teth before boss finds out-petak and gets pissed."

**Analysis**:
- Technical: kaeth, drift-kae, recalibrate
- Bureaucratic: -shen, -mar evidentials
- Street: "I'm thinking", "gets pissed", "boss"
- Mixed grammar: Evidentials + Common contractions

---

### Creative Resistance

**Street Sybari speakers** create new forms:

**Reclaimed -kel (traditional)**:
- Use more frequently than Europeans expect
- Assert indigenous epistemology through grammar

**SOV "errors"**:
- Not mistakes; deliberate use of Kael'nir structure
- Political resistance through syntax

**Slang evidentials**:
- "-mar-for-real" (witnessed-for-emphasis)
- "shen-solid" (oracle-confirmed-strongly)
- Indigenous creation within stolen language

---

## The Three Registers as Class System

| Register | Class | Education | Jobs | Power |
|----------|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| Technical | Tier 1-2 | University | Oracle Houses, executives | High |
| Bureaucratic | Tier 2-3 | Technical school | Bureau, mid-management | Medium |
| Street | Tier 4-5 | Minimal/none | Manual labor, service | Low |

**Language = Class Marker**:
- Speak Technical → Recognized as elite
- Speak Bureaucratic → Recognized as competent middle-class
- Speak Street → Marked as working-class/poor

**Accent = Destiny**: Your register reveals your background, limits your future

---

## Political Dimensions

### European Control

**Define "proper"**:
- Technical = correct
- Bureaucratic = acceptable
- Street = corruption

**Enforce standards**:
- Schools teach Technical/Bureaucratic only
- Jobs require specific registers
- Indigenous features criminalized

**Maintain hierarchy**:
- Elite children learn Technical natively (inherit advantage)
- Working-class excluded from Technical (can't access power)
- Language perpetuates class system

---

### Indigenous Resistance

**Reclaim Street Sybari**:
- Assert it's not "corruption" but survival
- Mix with traditional languages deliberately
- Use -kel (traditional) to mark indigenous knowledge

**Create alternative prestige**:
- Within indigenous communities, Street + traditional = valued
- Knowing Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali = high status
- Technical Sybari = collaboration (some view negatively)

**Underground register**:
- Secret meetings use full Kael'nir (illegal)
- Preserve linguistic complexity Europeans destroyed
- **Political**: Speaking traditional forms = resistance act

---

## Conclusion

**Three registers = three worlds**:
- **Technical**: World of power, privilege, exclusion
- **Bureaucratic**: World of competence, employment, standards
- **Street**: World of resistance, authenticity, survival

**Every conversation reveals power dynamics** through register choice

**The language itself is battlefield** (who speaks which register = who has power)
