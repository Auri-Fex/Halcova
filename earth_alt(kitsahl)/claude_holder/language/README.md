# Language (Sybari) - Master Navigation

**Section Overview**: The Sybari language - indigenous vocabulary stolen and forced into European grammatical structures. Linguistic appropriation mirrors technological theft.

## Core Principles

### Linguistic Appropriation Theme
Like oracle technology, Sybari represents **stolen indigenous knowledge**:
- Vocabulary extracted through torture and coercion
- Original grammar destroyed; European structure imposed
- Indigenous speakers criminalized for using their own words
- Colonial claim: "We developed this scientific language"

### Three-Layer Structure

**Indigenous Foundation** (Hidden):
- Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali roots
- Complex evidential systems
- Temporal flexibility
- Spiritual/philosophical depth

**European Imposition** (Visible):
- Simplified grammar (European language family patterns)
- Linear temporal system
- No honorifics (egalitarian pretense)
- "Scientific" vocabulary building

**Modern Hybrid** (Result):
- Indigenous words in European grammatical framework
- Evidentials preserved (needed for oracle work)
- Class stratification through register
- Ongoing linguistic colonialism

## Usage in Worldbuilding

### When to Use Sybari

**Technical/Oracle Contexts**:
- Oracle output ("The nareta-kaeth shows...")
- Bureau documentation
- Legal proceedings (evidentials required)
- Scientific papers on temporal mechanics

**Flavor/Atmosphere**:
- Character speech (code-switching between Common and Sybari)
- Place names (many derived from Sybari roots)
- Technical jargon (oracle operators speak mostly Sybari)
- Graffiti, resistance slogans

**Cultural Commentary**:
- Indigenous characters using forbidden words (political act)
- Wealthy using Technical Sybari (class marker)
- Working-class using Street Sybari (resistance to formalization)

### Pronunciation Guide

See [04_phonology.md](04_phonology.md) for full details, but key points:

- **ae** = "eye" (kael = "k-eye-l")
- **ei** = "ay" (keil = "k-ay-l")  
- **sh** = "sh" as in "ship"
- **th** = "th" as in "thin"
- **'** (apostrophe) = glottal stop (brief pause)

## Integration with Other Sections

### Cross-References to Core Canon
- Indigenous origins → [05_indigenous_traditions.md](../01_core_canon/05_indigenous_traditions.md)
- Linguistic theft → [07_the_theft.md](../01_core_canon/07_the_theft.md)
- Cultural appropriation → [08_cultural_appropriation.md](../01_core_canon/08_cultural_appropriation.md)

### Connections to Economics
- Technical Sybari = Tier 1-2 (educated elite)
- Street Sybari = Tier 4-5 (working-class)
- Language as economic barrier

### Connections to Geography
- District names often Sybari-derived
- Tidemark, The Tangles, etc. (corrupted indigenous place names)

## Design Notes

### Linguistic Realism
- Based on real conlang principles (agglutinative structure, evidential systems)
- Inspired by: Turkish (agglutination), Quechua (evidentials), Polynesian (open syllables)
- **Not** a full conlang (don't need complete grammar for narrative purposes)
- Focus on thematic resonance over linguistic completeness

### Thematic Consistency
Every linguistic choice reinforces worldbuilding themes:
- **Evidentials** = Prophecy requires epistemological precision
- **Three registers** = Class stratification
- **Forbidden words** = Ongoing colonial oppression
- **Indigenous roots** = Theft never forgotten
