# The Sybari Evidential System

**Definition**: Grammatical markers that indicate the **source** of the speaker's knowledge

**Why This Matters**: In a world where prophecy is real, distinguishing "I saw it happen" from "The oracle predicted it" from "I heard someone say it" is legally and epistemologically critical

**Origin**: Stolen from Kael'nir (original system had 16 evidentials; Europeans kept 8)

---

## What Are Evidentials?

### Basic Concept

In English, you can say:
- "John stole the money"

**Question**: How do you know?
- Did you see it? (witness)
- Did the oracle predict it? (prophecy)
- Did someone tell you? (hearsay)
- Did you deduce it? (logic)

English doesn't grammatically mark this. Sybari **requires** it.

---

### Sybari Equivalent

You **cannot** say: "John stole money" (grammatically incomplete)

You **must** say:
- "John stole money-**mar**" (I witnessed)
- "John stole money-**shen**" (oracle showed)
- "John stole money-**petak**" (I heard from someone)
- "John stole money-**teth**" (I deduced logically)

**The evidential suffix is required** (except in Street Sybari, where rules relax)

## The Eight Evidentials

### Complete System

| Suffix | Source | Certainty | Legal Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **-mar** | Direct witness | Highest | Testimony | vesh-mar (I saw violence) |
| **-shen** | Oracle/prophecy | High | Oracle evidence | vesh-shen (oracle shows violence) |
| **-kel** | Ancestral/traditional | Medium | Cultural knowledge | vesh-kel (ancestors taught: violence) |
| **-petak** | Reported/hearsay | Low | Inadmissible | vesh-petak (I heard: violence) |
| **-nareta** | Forecast/prediction | Variable | Oracle forecast | vesh-nareta (violence predicted) |
| **-teth** | Logical deduction | Medium | Circumstantial | vesh-teth (must be violence) |
| **-ath** | Assumed/probable | Low | Opinion | vesh-ath (probably violence) |
| **-nara** | Questioned/uncertain | Lowest | Doubt | vesh-nara (violence?) |

## Detailed Breakdown

### -mar (Direct Witness)

**Meaning**: "I personally witnessed this event"

**Usage**:
- Legal testimony (highest evidentiary value)
- Personal experience
- Cannot be used for predictions (can't witness future)

**Examples**:
- kael-mar: "I saw [it]"
- shen-mar: "I heard [someone] speak [it]"
- vesh-mar: "I witnessed violence"

**Legal Status**: Strongest evidence in court (absent oracle confirmation)

**Lying with -mar**: Perjury (severe penalty)

---

### -shen (Oracle/Prophecy)

**Meaning**: "The oracle device shows/showed this"

**Usage**:
- Oracle output
- Predictions with device backing
- Bureau reports (oracle-confirmed)

**Examples**:
- vesh-shen: "Oracle shows violence"
- nareta-kaeth-shen: "The forecast-device says [this]"
- drift-kae-shen: "Oracle indicates drift-level [X]"

**Legal Status**: 
- Pre-crime: Admissible as primary evidence
- Past events: Corroborating evidence only

**Oracle Accuracy Caveat**: Even with -shen, accuracy is ~60%; not perfect

---

### -kel (Ancestral/Traditional)

**Meaning**: "Ancestors/tradition teaches this" or "This is established cultural knowledge"

**Usage**:
- Cultural teachings
- Historical knowledge
- Traditional practices

**Examples**:
- kael-kel: "Ancestors taught [this way of seeing]"
- shen-kel: "Traditional saying [states]"
- mora-kel: "Truth according to tradition"

**Legal Status**: 
- Admissible for cultural practices
- **Lower weight for factual claims** (courts dismiss indigenous knowledge)

**Political Dimension**: 
- Indigenous peoples use -kel for traditional oracle knowledge
- Courts often reject -kel claims from indigenous speakers
- **Bias**: European -kel ("scientific tradition") given more weight than indigenous -kel

---

### -petak (Reported/Hearsay)

**Meaning**: "I heard this from someone else" or "This was reported to me"

**Usage**:
- Second-hand information
- Rumors
- News reports

**Examples**:
- vesh-petak: "I heard there was violence"
- shen-petak: "Someone told me [this]"
- kael-petak: "Reportedly [this was seen]"

**Legal Status**: Generally inadmissible (hearsay rule)

**Exception**: Bureau reports sometimes cite -petak (questionable legality)

---

### -nareta (Forecast/Prediction)

**Meaning**: "This is a forecast" or "This is predicted to occur"

**Usage**:
- Future events
- Oracle predictions
- Any forecast (with or without device)

**Examples**:
- vesh-nareta: "Violence is forecast"
- kaeth-drift-nareta: "Oracle will drift [prediction]"
- mora-nareta: "Truth will be revealed [prophecy]"

**Legal Status**:
- Pre-crime arrests: Primary evidence
- Contracts: Future obligations
- Insurance: Risk assessment

**Accuracy Factor**: Must specify probability with -nareta
- vesh-nareta 60%: "60% probability of violence forecast"

---

### -teth (Logical Deduction)

**Meaning**: "I deduce this logically" or "This must be true based on evidence"

**Usage**:
- Logical conclusions
- Circumstantial evidence
- Scientific reasoning

**Examples**:
- vesh-teth: "There must have been violence [based on evidence]"
- kael-teth: "Logically [this] would be seen"
- mora-teth: "This must be true [deductive reasoning]"

**Legal Status**: Admissible as circumstantial evidence

**Strength**: Depends on quality of underlying logic

---

### -ath (Assumed/Probable)

**Meaning**: "I assume this" or "This is probably true"

**Usage**:
- Assumptions
- Probable conclusions
- Best guesses

**Examples**:
- vesh-ath: "Probably violence"
- kael-ath: "Likely [this was] seen"
- mora-ath: "Probably true"

**Legal Status**: Weak; opinion level

**Common Use**: Daily conversation (non-critical claims)

---

### -nara (Questioned/Uncertain)

**Meaning**: "Is this true?" or "I question this" or "Maybe?"

**Usage**:
- Questions about truth
- Expressing doubt
- Seeking confirmation

**Examples**:
- vesh-nara: "Was there violence?" / "Violence, really?"
- kael-nara: "Was [this] seen?" / "Did [you] see [it]?"
- mora-nara: "Is this true?" / "Truth?"

**Legal Status**: Not evidentiary (it's a question)

**Tone**: Can be neutral inquiry or skeptical challenge

---

## Evidential Hierarchy

### Legal Weight (Strongest → Weakest)

1. **-mar** (Direct witness) - "I saw it happen"
2. **-shen** (Oracle showed) - "Device confirmed"
3. **-teth** (Logical deduction) - "Must be true based on evidence"
4. **-kel** (Traditional knowledge) - "Ancestors taught" *
5. **-ath** (Assumed/probable) - "Probably true"
6. **-petak** (Hearsay) - "I heard from someone"
7. **-nareta** (Forecast) - "Will happen" **
8. **-nara** (Questioned) - "Is it true?"

**Notes**:
- (*) -kel weight varies by speaker's social status (indigenous -kel often dismissed)
- (**) -nareta is future-facing; different category than past/present evidentials

---

## Multiple Evidentials (Stacking)

### Combining Sources

Sometimes multiple evidential sources apply:

**Format**: Root + evidential₁ + evidential₂

**Examples**:

**vesh-mar-shen**: 
- Literal: "Violence-witnessed-oracle-confirmed"
- Meaning: "I witnessed violence AND the oracle confirmed it"
- Legal weight: Extremely strong (two independent confirmations)

**kael-petak-shen**:
- Literal: "Sight-reported-oracle-showed"
- Meaning: "Someone reported seeing it AND the oracle confirmed"
- Legal weight: Strong (oracle validates hearsay)

**mora-teth-mar**:
- Literal: "Truth-deduced-witnessed"
- Meaning: "I deduced it would be true AND then witnessed it"
- Legal weight: Very strong (prediction confirmed by observation)

---

### Contradictory Evidentials

**Format**: Root + evidential₁ + **ne-**evidential₂

**ne-** prefix negates the second evidential

**Examples**:

**vesh-mar-ne-shen**:
- Literal: "Violence-witnessed-NOT-oracle-confirmed"
- Meaning: "I witnessed violence but the oracle did NOT predict it"
- Implication: Oracle missed it (device failure or out-of-window)

**kael-shen-ne-mar**:
- Literal: "Sight-oracle-showed-NOT-witnessed"
- Meaning: "Oracle predicted I'd see it but I didn't witness it"
- Implication: False prediction or event didn't occur

---

## Register Variation

### Technical Sybari (Formal)

**Rule**: ALWAYS use appropriate evidential

**Example**:
- "The subject committed theft-mar on the 15th-shen"
- (I witnessed the theft, oracle confirmed the date)

**No exceptions**: Missing evidential = grammatically incomplete

---

### Bureaucratic Sybari (Standard)

**Rule**: Use evidentials in official documents; optional in casual speech

**Example**:
- Official report: "Subject committed theft-mar"
- Casual conversation: "Subject committed theft"

---

### Street Sybari (Informal)

**Rule**: Evidentials often dropped; only used for emphasis

**Example**:
- "He stole it" (no evidential; context implies)
- "He stole it-mar!" (emphasis: I SAW it, no doubt)

---

## Cultural Significance

### European Perspective

**Official Position**: "Evidentials are scientific innovation, ensuring precision in oracle-based society"

**Reality**: Stolen from Kael'nir; simplified; repurposed for legal control

---

### Indigenous Perspective

**Original Purpose** (Kael'nir):
- Evidentials marked spiritual epistemology
- Respect for sources of knowledge
- Humility (acknowledge what you don't know)

**Modern Corruption**:
- Europeans use evidentials for legal control, not spiritual humility
- Indigenous -kel (traditional knowledge) dismissed in court
- System weaponized against the people who created it

---

### The Irony

**Kael'nir oracle-keepers** developed 16 evidentials to mark **subtle gradations of prophetic certainty** (spiritual precision).

**Europeans** kept 8, stripped spiritual meaning, use them for **legal prosecution** and **social control**.

**Every evidential is reminder**: This system was stolen, simplified, weaponized.
