# Sybari Morphology - Word Formation

**Type**: Agglutinative (build words by stacking affixes onto roots)

**Pattern**: Root + (Derivational Affixes) + (Inflectional Affixes) + (Evidential)

**Key Principle**: Transparent morphology (each affix has clear meaning; no irregular forms)

---

## Root Structure

### Consonant Roots (Indigenous Origin)

Most Sybari roots are 2-3 consonants from indigenous languages:

**2-Consonant Roots** (Most common):
- **K-L** (sight/knowledge): kael, keil, kail, kol
- **V-SH** (violence/force): vesh, vash, vish, vosh
- **M-R** (truth): mar, mor, mur, mir
- **SH-N** (speech): shen, shan, shin, shon
- **P-T-K** (location): petak, putok, pitek

**Vowel Patterns** (Create different parts of speech):
- **a** pattern: Nouns (vesh = violence, mar = truth)
- **e** pattern: Verbs (kel = to know, shen = to speak)
- **i** pattern: Adjectives (vish = violent, mir = true)
- **o** pattern: Adverbs (vosh = violently, mor = truly)

---

### Root Examples

**K-L Root Family** (sight/knowledge):
- **kael**: sight, vision (noun)
- **keil**: to see, to know (verb)
- **kail**: seen, known (adjective)
- **kol**: knowledge (abstract noun)

**V-SH Root Family** (violence/force):
- **vesh**: violence (noun)
- **vash**: to strike, to force (verb)
- **vish**: violent (adjective)
- **vosh**: violently (adverb)

**M-R Root Family** (truth):
- **mar**: truth, reality (noun)
- **mer**: to be true, to verify (verb)
- **mir**: true, real (adjective)
- **mor**: truly (adverb)

---

## Derivational Affixes

### Agent Suffix: -oth

**Meaning**: "one who does X" (agent/doer)

**Pattern**: Verb + -oth = Agent noun

**Examples**:
- keil (to know) + -oth = **keiloth** (knower, sage)
- vash (to strike) + -oth = **vashoth** (striker, warrior)
- shen (to speak) + -oth = **shenoth** (speaker, prophet)
- **kael + -oth = kaeloth** (seer, oracle operator)

**With Plural**:
- kaeloth-el = seers (plural)
- veshoth-el = perpetrators (plural)

---

### Patient Suffix: -im

**Meaning**: "one who receives X" (patient/receiver)

**Pattern**: Verb + -im = Patient noun

**Examples**:
- vash (to strike) + -im = **vashim** (victim, struck one)
- keil (to know) + -im = **keilim** (student, taught one)
- shen (to speak) + -im = **shenim** (listener, spoken-to one)

**Use**:
- Legal contexts (victim designation)
- Social roles (student, apprentice)

---

### Instrument Suffix: -eth

**Meaning**: "tool/device for X"

**Pattern**: Verb/Noun + -eth = Instrument

**Examples**:
- kael (sight) + -eth = **kaeth** (sight-tool = oracle device)
- vash (strike) + -eth = **vasheth** (strike-tool = weapon)
- tem (time) + -eth = **temeth** (time-tool = clock)

**Common Term**: **nareta-kaeth** (forecast-device = prophecy machine)

---

### Place Suffix: -nul

**Meaning**: "place of X"

**Pattern**: Noun/Verb + -nul = Place

**Examples**:
- petak (marked location) + -nul = **petaknul** (designated place)
- kael (sight) + -nul = **kaelnul** (viewing place, observatory)
- vesh (violence) + -nul = **veshnul** (place of violence, battlefield)

**Formal Usage**: Bureau designations (petaknul-7 = Location 7)

---

### Abstract Suffix: -ra

**Meaning**: "quality/state of X" (abstract noun)

**Pattern**: Adjective + -ra = Abstract noun

**Examples**:
- mir (true) + -ra = **mirra** (truth, truthfulness)
- vish (violent) + -ra = **vishra** (violence, violent nature)
- drift (unstable) + -ra = **driftra** (instability, drift quality)

**Philosophical Usage**: mora-ra (truth-reality = ultimate truth)

---

### Measure Suffix: -kae

**Meaning**: "degree/level of X"

**Pattern**: Noun + -kae = Measurement

**Examples**:
- drift + -kae = **drift-kae** (drift level, error rate)
- vesh + -kae = **vesh-kae** (violence level)
- probability + -kae = **probability-kae** (probability measure)

**Technical Usage**: Oracle specifications (drift-kae 15% = 15% error rate)

---

## Inflectional Affixes

### Number: -el (Plural)

**Meaning**: "multiple X"

**Pattern**: Noun + -el = Plural

**Examples**:
- kael (sight) + -el = **kaelel** (sights, visions)
- kaeloth (seer) + -el = **kaelothel** (seers)
- kaeth (device) + -el = **kaethel** (devices)

**Special**: Some borrowed words use Common plural (-s)
- operator → operators (not operatorel)

---

### Locative: -im (at/to/in)

**Meaning**: "at/to/in X location"

**Pattern**: Noun + -im = Locative

**Examples**:
- nul (place) + -im = **nulim** (at the place)
- kaeth (device) + -im = **kaethim** (at/to the device)
- petaknul (location) + -im = **petaknulim** (at the designated location)

**Note**: Same form as patient suffix -im; context disambiguates

---

### Temporal Markers

**Pattern**: Verb + temporal marker

| Marker | Tense/Aspect | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| *(none)* | Present/Habitual | shen = speaks |
| **-va** | Past | shen-va = spoke |
| **-na** | Future | shen-na = will speak |
| **-ra** | Perfect | shen-ra = has spoken |
| **-ma** | Progressive | shen-ma = is speaking |

**Combinations**:
- shen-va-ra = had spoken (past perfect)
- shen-na-ma = will be speaking (future progressive)

---

## Negation: ne-

**Meaning**: "not X"

**Pattern**: ne- + (word) = Negation

**Examples**:
- ne-kael = not seen, invisible
- ne-mar = not true, false
- ne-shen = doesn't speak, silent
- ne-vesh = non-violent, peaceful

**With Evidentials**:
- vesh-mar = violence witnessed
- vesh-ne-mar = violence NOT witnessed
- ne-vesh-mar = NON-violence witnessed

---

## Compound Formation

### Head-Final Structure

**Pattern**: Modifier + Head

**The HEAD (rightmost element) determines word class**:
- vesh (violence) + nareta (forecast) = **vesh-nareta** (violence forecast)
- drift (instability) + kae (measure) = **drift-kae** (drift level)
- kael (sight) + oth (agent) = **kaeloth** (seer)

---

### Linking Vowel: -a-

**Used**: When phonological clash occurs (two consonants meet awkwardly)

**Examples**:
- kael + shen = kael-a-shen (sight-speak = oracle output)
- tem + flux = tem-a-flux (time-flow-change = temporal instability)

**Not Used**: When syllables naturally flow
- vesh + nareta = vesh-nareta (no linker needed)

---

### Complex Compounds (3+ elements)

**Pattern**: Build left to right; head is rightmost

**Examples**:

**nareta-kaeth-oth** (forecast-device-agent):
- nareta (forecast) + kaeth (device) + oth (agent)
- = "oracle operator" (literally: forecast-device-agent)

**vesh-probability-kae-high** (violence-probability-measure-high):
- vesh (violence) + probability + kae (measure) + high
- = "high violence probability level"

**drift-kae-excessive-mar** (drift-measure-excessive-witnessed):
- drift + kae (measure) + excessive + mar (witnessed)
- = "excessive drift level observed"

---

## Affix Stacking Order

### Standard Template

**ROOT** + (derivation) + (inflection) + (evidential)

**Example Breakdown**:

**kaelothel-im-mar**:
1. **kael** (root: sight)
2. **-oth** (derivation: agent = seer)
3. **-el** (inflection: plural = seers)
4. **-im** (inflection: locative = at the seers)
5. **-mar** (evidential: witnessed)

**Full meaning**: "at the seers (witnessed)"

---

### Maximum Complexity

**Theoretical maximum** (rarely used):

**ne-vesh-oth-el-nul-im-va-mar**:
1. **ne-** (negation: non-)
2. **vesh** (root: violence)
3. **-oth** (agent: perpetrator)
4. **-el** (plural: perpetrators)
5. **-nul** (place: place of perpetrators)
6. **-im** (locative: at the place)
7. **-va** (past tense)
8. **-mar** (witnessed)

**Meaning**: "at the place of non-perpetrators in the past (witnessed)"

**Reality**: Such forms exist in grammar but rarely used; prefer shorter constructions

---

## Borrowed Words (European Influence)

### Integration Pattern

**Loanwords from Common** adapt to Sybari phonology:

**Retain**: Core meaning
**Adapt**: Phonological structure (break clusters, add vowels)
**Integrate**: Can take Sybari affixes

**Examples**:

**"probability"** (borrowed):
- Kept as: probability (or shortened: prob)
- Can combine: probability-kae (probability measure)
- With evidential: probability-shen (oracle shows probability)

**"operator"** (borrowed):
- Kept as: operator
- Plural: operators (Common plural, not -el)
- Or Sybari: operat-oth (one who operates)

**"crystal"** (borrowed, but replaced):
- English: crystal
- Sybari prefers: **shard** (indigenous term)

---

## Productive vs. Fixed Forms

### Productive Affixes (Create new words freely)

**Can combine with any appropriate root**:
- **-oth** (agent): Any verb can add -oth
- **-el** (plural): Any noun can pluralize
- **-im** (locative): Any place noun
- **Evidentials**: Any statement can take evidential

---

### Fixed Forms (Lexicalized)

**Some combinations are frozen** (learned as single units):

**kaeth** (oracle device):
- From: kael (sight) + -eth (tool)
- But: Learned as single word, not analyzed

**petaknul** (location designation):
- From: petak (marked) + nul (place)
- But: Used as single bureaucratic term

**nareta** (forecast):
- Possibly derived, but origin unclear
- Treated as atomic root

---

## Register Differences

### Technical Sybari (Formal)

**Full morphology**:
- All affixes present
- Hyphens mark boundaries
- No contractions

**Example**: kael-oth-el-im-mar
(sight-agent-plural-locative-witnessed = "at the seers, witnessed")

---

### Bureaucratic Sybari (Standard)

**Standard morphology**:
- Most affixes present
- Some hyphens (formal contexts)
- Rare contractions

**Example**: kaelothel-im-mar
(Less hyphenation than Technical)

---

### Street Sybari (Informal)

**Simplified morphology**:
- Drop some affixes
- Vowel reduction
- Contractions common
- Mixed with Common

**Example**: "Kaeloth at place" (drops -el plural, -im locative)
Or: "Seers there-mar" (uses Common "there" instead of -im)

---

## Morphological Creativity

### Neologisms (New Words)

**Easy to create** (productive morphology):

**Need word for "oracle repairperson"?**
- kaeth (device) + fix (verb, from Common) + -oth (agent)
- = **kaeth-fix-oth** (oracle repair agent)

**Need word for "prophecy addict"?**
- nareta (forecast) + obsess (from Common) + -oth (agent)
- = **nareta-obsess-oth** (prophecy-obsessed person)

**Oracle Houses create technical jargon constantly**:
- New affixes (rare)
- New compounds (common)
- Borrowed terms from Common (frequent)

---

### Indigenous Creativity (Reclaimed Forms)

**Street Sybari** creates forms Europeans didn't anticipate:

**kael-kel-ra** (sight-ancestral-quality):
- Literal: "ancestral sight quality"
- Meaning: "Traditional oracle wisdom" (vs European mechanical approach)
- **Political**: Reclaims indigenous epistemology through morphology

**mora-kel-shen** (truth-ancestral-speak):
- Literal: "ancestral truth speech"
- Meaning: "Speaking truth from indigenous knowledge"
- **Resistance**: Uses stolen language to assert indigenous truth

---

## The Appropriation in Morphology

### What Was Stolen

**Indigenous Systems**:
- Kael'nir: Complex agglutination (10+ affixes could stack)
- Tav'mora: Honorific morphology (respect markers)
- Shen'kali: Tonal morphology (pitch changes meaning)

**Europeans Kept**:
- Basic agglutination (simplified)
- Core affixes (-oth, -el, -nul, -eth)
- Transparent structure (easy to learn)

---

### What Was Destroyed

**Lost Complexity**:
- 10+ derivational affixes → 5 common ones
- Honorific system → Eliminated entirely
- Tonal distinctions → Flattened
- Irregular forms → Regularized (lost historical depth)

**Cultural Loss**:
- Some affixes marked spiritual concepts (gone)
- Kinship affixes (destroyed)
- Sacred/profane distinction (eliminated)

---

### What Indigenous Speakers Remember

**Underground teaching** preserves some traditional forms:

**-kel-sacred** (ancestral-holy):
- Original Kael'nir affix marking sacred knowledge
- Europeans eliminated (no "sacred" in "scientific" language)
- **Still used**: In secret rituals (criminal if discovered)

**Honorific -tav** (from Tav'mora):
- Marked respect for elders, ancestors
- Europeans eliminated ("egalitarian" pretense)
- **Still used**: In traditional greetings (underground)

---

## Morphological Politics

### Who Controls Word Formation?

**Oracle Houses**: Create technical neologisms (proprietary terms)

**Bureau**: Standardizes bureaucratic compounds (legal language)

**Universities**: Teach "proper" morphology (European narrative)

**Street Speakers**: Create resistance forms (reclaim morphology)

**Indigenous**: Remember original complexity (criminalized if spoken)

---

## Examples Across Complexity

### Simple (1-2 morphemes)

- **kael**: sight
- **kael-mar**: sight-witnessed = "I saw"
- **vesh**: violence
- **vesh-shen**: violence-oracle = "oracle shows violence"

---

### Medium (3-4 morphemes)

- **kael-oth-el**: sight-agent-plural = "seers"
- **vesh-nareta-shen**: violence-forecast-oracle = "oracle predicts violence"
- **drift-kae-high**: drift-measure-high = "high drift level"

---

### Complex (5+ morphemes)

- **kael-oth-el-nul-im-mar**: sight-agent-plural-place-locative-witnessed
  = "at the seers' place, witnessed"

- **vesh-probability-kae-excessive-shen-mar**: violence-probability-measure-excessive-oracle-witnessed
  = "excessive violence probability level shown by oracle and witnessed"

---

## Learning Morphology

### For Europeans (Tier 1-3)

**Taught**: Standard affixes, productive rules, technical compounds

**Practice**: Building new words for oracle contexts

**Mastery**: Can create grammatical neologisms

---

### For Indigenous (Underground)

**Taught**: Traditional affixes (illegal), original complexity

**Practice**: Secret; risk of arrest

**Mastery**: Know both systems (stolen Sybari + original languages)

---

## The Living System

**Sybari morphology is productive** (new words created daily):
- Oracle Houses: Technical innovations
- Bureau: Legal terminology
- Street: Resistance neologisms
- Indigenous: Reclaimed traditional forms

**Every new word is political** (who has authority to create? who decides "correct"?)
