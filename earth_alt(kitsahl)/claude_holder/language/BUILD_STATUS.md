## Major Accomplishments

### Complete Linguistic System ✓

**Phonology**: 21 consonants, 5 vowels, simple syllables, Roman orthography

**Morphology**: Agglutinative, productive affixes (-oth agent, -nul place, -kae measure), transparent structure

**Grammar**: SVO (imposed), SOV (suppressed), evidential requirements, full paradigms

**Evidentials**: 8 markers (-mar witness, -shen oracle, -kel ancestral, -petak hearsay, -nareta forecast, -teth deduction, -ath probable, -nara questioned)

**Registers**: Three complete (Technical, Bureaucratic, Street) with examples

---

### Thematic Integration ✓

**Linguistic Appropriation Parallel**:
- Vocabulary stolen through torture (like oracle tech)
- Grammar destroyed and European imposed (like industrialization)
- Indigenous speakers criminalized (like traditional practice)
- Three source languages suppressed (Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali)

**Evidentials as Core Feature**:
- Stolen from Kael'nir (16 → 8)
- Legal requirement (court testimony)
- Epistemological precision (oracle world needs source markers)
- Weaponized against indigenous peoples

**Class Through Language**:
- Technical = Elite (Tier 1-2)
- Bureaucratic = Middle (Tier 2-3)
- Street = Working-class (Tier 4-5)
- Register = destiny (accent reveals background, limits future)

---

### Sample Texts Across Contexts ✓

**Created examples for**:
1. Oracle House technical report (full Technical Sybari)
2. Bureau arrest report (Bureaucratic)
3. Working-class conversation (Street)
4. Court testimony (Legal, formal)
5. Oracle device readout (Technical, machine-generated)
6. Indigenous underground speech (illegal Kael'nir SOV)
7. Mixed code-switching (Common + Sybari)
8. Resistance graffiti (political slogan)

**Shows language in actual use** - not just abstract rules

---

## Content Quality

### Strengths ✓
- Linguistically realistic (evidentials, agglutination)
- Thematically consistent (theft parallel maintained)
- Socially grounded (registers reflect class)
- Politically charged (language as resistance)
- Usable for fiction (clear examples, pronunciation guides)

### Completeness
**Core system**: 100% (phonology, morphology, grammar, evidentials, registers)
**Historical context**: 60% (overview done; detailed origins pending)
**Social usage**: 90% (registers complete; some class markers docs pending)
**Examples**: 90% (major text types covered)

---

## Integration Points

### With Core Canon ✓
- Timeline references linguistic genocide (1520s-1650s)
- The Theft document parallels language extraction
- Cultural Appropriation covers language erasure
- Modern Consequences shows ongoing criminalization

### With Economics ✓
- Language as economic barrier (Technical Sybari = job requirement)
- Oracle Houses create proprietary terminology
- Bureau requires Bureaucratic competence
- Class stratification through register

### With Geography
- Place names from Sybari (corrupted indigenous)
- District names (petaknul designations)
- TO DEVELOP in remaining docs

---

## Estimated Completion

**Current Status**: ~65% complete (core system done, context/examples mostly done)

**Remaining Work**: ~8,000 words across 8 documents
- Historical deep dives (2 docs, ~4,000 words)
- Specialized references (4 docs, ~3,000 words)
- Social context (2 docs, ~1,000 words)

**Total Section When Complete**: ~31,000 words

---

## Next Priorities

### Immediate (Complete foundation)
1. **02_indigenous_origins.md** - Full detail on Kael'nir, Tav'mora, Shen'kali
2. **03_linguistic_genocide.md** - Parallel extraction narrative

### Secondary (Expand system)
3. **10_oracle_domains.md** - Specialized vocabulary sets
4. **12_forbidden_words.md** - Criminalized terms
5. **08_evidential_markers.md** - Each evidential in depth

### Tertiary (Social context)
6. **14_class_markers.md** - Linguistic class indicators
7. **17_indigenous_resistance.md** - Language reclamation movements
8. **15_code_switching.md** - Register movement patterns

---

## Usage Guide (What You Can Do Now)

### For Fiction Writing
- Use sample texts as templates
- Reference glossary for vocabulary
- Apply evidentials to mark knowledge sources
- Show class through register choice

### For Worldbuilding
- Place names from Sybari roots
- Character speech patterns reflect tier
- Oracle outputs in Technical Sybari
- Bureau documents in Bureaucratic
- Street conversations code-switch

### For Atmosphere
- Drop Sybari terms into Common dialogue
- Use evidentials in legal scenes
- Show indigenous characters using forbidden SOV
- Elite characters speak flawless Technical

---

## Quality Notes

### What Works ✓
- Evidentials unique and thematically perfect
- Registers clearly differentiated
- Examples show real usage
- Morphology productive and learnable
- Political dimensions woven throughout

### What Could Expand
- More indigenous language detail (Kael'nir/Tav'mora/Shen'kali)
- Additional vocabulary domains (medical, military, domestic)
- More sample texts (letters, songs, poetry)
- Dialectal variation (regional differences)
- Historical linguistics (how Sybari evolved 1650-1870)

---

## The Sybari Language Is...

**Functional**: Complete enough to use in narrative
**Political**: Every word carries weight of appropriation
**Realistic**: Based on real linguistic principles
**Flexible**: Three registers cover all social contexts
**Memorable**: Evidentials and agglutination distinctive
**Thematic**: Mirrors oracle technology theft perfectly

---

## Next Session Decision Point

**Option A**: Complete remaining Language docs (8 documents, ~8,000 words)
- Finish section entirely
- Have complete linguistic reference
- Then move to Social Structures

**Option B**: Move to Social Structures now
- Language foundation solid enough
- Can reference what exists
- Return to complete Language later

**Recommendation**: Option B (move to Social Structures)
- Core Sybari system complete
- Can use in worldbuilding now
- Remaining docs are enrichment, not essential foundation
- Social Structures will benefit from complete Core Canon + Language foundation

---

**Status**: CORE COMPLETE - System usable, enrichment pending

**Achievement**: Built complete constructed language in one session ✓

**Next**: Social Structures (race, gender, class, family, religion in oracle world)
