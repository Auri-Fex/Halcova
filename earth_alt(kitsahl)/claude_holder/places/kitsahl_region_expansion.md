# THE KITSAHL REGION: EXPANDED GEOGRAPHY

## I. TERRITORIAL NAMING & POLITICAL STATUS

### The Question of "Washington"

**In our alternate history, Washington State never existed.**

The 1846 Oregon Treaty that split the Pacific Northwest at the 49th parallel between Britain and the United States **never happened**. Instead, Britain retained control of the entire region due to:

1. **Oracle War Dynamics (1710s-1860s)**: Indigenous oracle-aided resistance made American expansion far more costly
2. **Crystal Discoveries (1820s-1840s)**: Windbreak Range deposits made Britain unwilling to cede territory
3. **HBC Entrenchment**: Hudson's Bay Company infrastructure too valuable to abandon
4. **Imperial Priority**: Oracle technology became strategic priority; Pacific Northwest = crown jewel

**Result**: The entire Pacific Northwest from California to Alaska remains British territory.

### What It's Called Instead

**Official Name (Imperial)**: **The Kitsahl Crown Territory**

**Common Usage**:
- **"The Kitsahl"** (most common shorthand)
- **"The Northwest Territory"** (formal documents)
- **"West Crescent"** (imperial context)
- **"The Oracle Lands"** (among colonists, referring to crystal wealth)

**Indigenous Names** (suppressed but surviving):
- **"Kael'nir'ah"** (Kael'nir people: "Land of Crystal Songs")
- **"Tav'esh Morah"** (Tav'mora people: "Where Waters Meet Sky")
- **"Shen'kala Thesh"** (Shen'kali people: "Forest of Eternal Memory")

## II. THE KITSAHL CROWN TERRITORY

### Political Structure

**Established**: 1858 (formalized crown colony status)
**Capital**: Greymouth (population 380,000 in 1873)

*The Kitsahl Territory is a colonial extraction zone wrapped in imperial bureaucracy, built on stolen land with stolen knowledge, maintained by force and surveillance, and slowly eating itself through resource depletion and environmental catastrophe.*

*Everyone who lives here knows it, but the ones who profit don't care, and the ones who suffer can't escape.*
