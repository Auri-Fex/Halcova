## ✅ NAME CORRECTIONS COMPLETED!

I've successfully updated the three new files with the correct naming:

### **CORRECT NAMES NOW IN USE:**
- **City**: **Kitsahl** (replacing all "Greymouth"/"Graymouth")
- **Territory**: **New Albion** (replacing "Kitsahl Crown Territory")
- **Bay**: **Kitsahl Bay** (replacing "Grey Bay")
- **Original Fort**: **Fort Kitsahl** (replacing "Fort Grey")
- **Trust**: **Kitsahl Resonance Trust** (replacing "Greymouth Resonance Trust")

### **FILES UPDATED IN YOUR DRIVE:**

✅ **places/kitsahl_region_expansion.md** - All instances corrected
✅ **systems/bureau_preemptive_justice.md** - All instances corrected  
✅ **systems/kitsahl_resonance_trust.md** - Renamed and all instances corrected
✅ **NAME_CORRECTION_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide for updating remaining files

### **REMAINING WORK NEEDED:**

Your existing Drive documents still use "Greymouth" - you'll need to do a global find-replace on these files:

**High Priority** (reference Kitsahl frequently):
- greymouth_overview.md → rename to kitsahl_overview.md
- All 5 district files (admiralty_heights, crown_square, the_tangles, foundry_row, tidemark)
- regional_context.md

**Medium Priority**:
- Economy files (oracle_markets, currency, prices_wages, crystal_economy)
- Mechanics files (oracle_mechanics files)

**Lower Priority**:
- History, social_structures, language files (fewer references)

### **SIMPLE FIX:**

Use your text editor's find-and-replace across all .md files:
1. Find: "Greymouth" → Replace: "Kitsahl"
2. Find: "Graymouth" → Replace: "Kitsahl"
3. Find: "Grey Bay" → Replace: "Kitsahl Bay"
4. Find: "Fort Grey" → Replace: "Fort Kitsahl"

## **YOUR WORLD IS NOW:**

**City**: **Kitsahl** (population 380,000) - Named after Chief Kitsahl, indigenous oracle-keeper
**Territory**: **New Albion** - Historical Francis Drake name, revived 1858 for Crown Territory
**Founded**: 1835 (HBC Fort Kitsahl) 
**Location**: Kitsahl Bay, Pacific Northwest coast

This aligns perfectly with your intent: Kitsahl replaces Seattle, New Albion replaces Washington State!
