## Core Achievements

### Racial Hierarchy Established ✓

**Four-tier system**:
1. Europeans (colonial powers) - Control oracle industry
2. "Lesser" Europeans (Irish, Jews, etc.) - Some access
3. Non-indigenous POC - Subject to racism, no oracle blame
4. Indigenous peoples - Bottom tier, original creators now most oppressed

**Prophecy racism mechanics**:
- Oracle trained on biased historical data
- Predictions become self-fulfilling
- "Scientific" justification for colonial oppression
- Bureau algorithmic racism (neighborhood = +40% crime probability)

---

### Gender Dynamics Mapped ✓

**Victorian patriarchy + prophecy**:
- Women's oracle access mediated by men
- Career forecasts limited to domestic roles
- Marriage predictions controlled by fathers
- Reproductive surveillance (pregnancy, fertility predictions)

**Women in oracle industry**:
- Operators allowed (supervised, underpaid)
- Leadership excluded (glass ceiling)
- Lady Amelia (only female Big Five leader) = exception proving rule

**Resistance**:
- Women's suffrage + oracle rights movement
- Underground networks share access
- Gender + race intersections (indigenous women doubly oppressed)

---

### Intersectionality Shown ✓

**Daily life examples across identities**:
- **Charles** (European/Man/Wealthy): Maximum privilege, no awareness
- **Margaret** (European/Woman/Professional): Gender limited, race privileged
- **Thomas** (European/Man/Poor): Class exploited, gender privileged
- **Sarah** (Indigenous/Woman/Poor): All oppressions compound, most aware

**Key insight**: Single-axis analysis insufficient; identities interact

---

## Thematic Integration

### With Core Canon ✓
- Racial hierarchy → The Theft, Cultural Appropriation, Modern Consequences
- Gender control → Surveillance State, Oracle Economy
- Class system → Big Five, Bureau operations

### With Economics ✓
- Five-tier class already established
- Oracle access = economic access
- Language registers = class markers

### With Language ✓
- Sybari registers reflect class
- Indigenous forbidden words = linguistic oppression
- Gender in language (Sybari lacks grammatical gender, unlike source languages)

### With Geography ✓
- Districts segregated by race/class
- Tidemark (indigenous/poor) vs. Admiralty Heights (wealthy)
- Bureau surveillance patterns spatial

## Remaining Work Estimate

**14 documents** across 5 categories:
- Race (2 docs, ~4,000 words)
- Gender (2 docs, ~4,000 words)
- Class (3 docs, ~5,000 words)
- Family (3 docs, ~5,000 words)
- Religion (2 docs, ~4,000 words)
- Intersectionality (2 docs, ~3,000 words)

**Total remaining**: ~25,000 words
**Total section when complete**: ~34,000 words

---

## Next Priorities

### Immediate (Complete foundation)
1. **02_indigenous_peoples.md** - Detailed ongoing oppression
2. **07_five_tier_system.md** - Expand class documentation
3. **16_intersecting_oppressions.md** - Theoretical framework

### Secondary (Expand systems)
4. **03_racial_surveillance.md** - Bureau algorithmic racism
5. **08_social_mobility.md** - Prophecy prevents movement
6. **14_prophecy_vs_faith.md** - Theological crisis

### Tertiary (Detail contexts)
7. **10_family_overview.md** - Marriage and inheritance
8. **13_religion_overview.md** - Major faiths
9. **17_resistance_movements.md** - Cross-identity organizing

## Quality Notes

### Strengths ✓
- Intersectional approach (not single-axis oppression)
- Grounded in historical 1870s dynamics
- Prophecy amplifies existing oppression (not creates new)
- Multiple perspectives (privileged + oppressed)
- Concrete examples (daily life, not abstract theory)

### What Works
- Four characters showing different intersections
- Prophecy as tool of oppression (self-fulfilling cycles)
- Indigenous centrality (not sidebar to European narrative)
- Gender beyond "women's issues" (patriarchy + prophecy system)
- Class consciousness (characters aware/unaware differently)

---

## Usage Guide

### For Character Development

**Consider all identity axes**:
- Race, gender, class, religion, sexuality, ability
- Each combination = unique experience
- Use daily life examples as templates

**Example Character Creation**:
- Indigenous woman, Tier 3, oracle operator
- Privileges: Education, employment, some income
- Oppressions: Race, gender, cultural erasure
- Conflicts: Works for system oppressing her people

---

### For Plot Development

**Social structures create conflict**:
- Bureau surveillance targets marginalized
- Oracle predictions justify oppression
- Resistance movements predict and disrupted
- Personal success vs. systemic change tension

**Example Plots**:
- Woman fighting for career oracle rights (gender)
- Indigenous activist reclaiming stolen knowledge (race)
- Cross-class alliance against Bureau (class)
- All three intersecting (intersectionality)

---

### For Atmospheric Detail

**Every scene shows social structures**:
- Who's surveilled by Bureau?
- Who speaks which Sybari register?
- Who accesses oracles?
- Whose family structures respected?

**Small details**:
- Bureau checkpoints in Tidemark (not Admiralty Heights)
- Women accompanied to Oracle Houses
- Working-class can't afford forecasts
- Indigenous sacred practices hidden

## The Project Now

**Complete Sections**:
1. ✓ Core Canon (12 docs, ~39,000 words)
2. ✓ Economics (previous work)
3. ✓ Geography (previous work)
4. ✓ Language (10 docs, ~14,700 words)

**Total Worldbuilding**: ~70,000+ words

**Foundation Status**: SOLID - Can write in this world now

---

## Next Session Decision

**Option A**: Complete Social Structures (14 remaining docs)
- Finish section entirely
- Have complete social analysis
- Then move to Daily Life section

**Option B**: Move to Daily Life now
- Foundation solid enough
- Can reference what exists
- Return to complete Social Structures later

**Recommendation**: Your choice - foundation is usable either way

---

**Status**: FOUNDATION COMPLETE - Core dynamics established, enrichment pending
