# Gender Roles in Oracle Society

**Foundation**: Victorian patriarchy amplified by oracle predictions

**Ideology**: "Separate spheres" - men (public) vs. women (domestic)

**Oracle Justification**: "Prophecy proves natural gender differences"

---

## The Patriarchal System

### Men's Sphere: Public

**Domains**:
- Politics (voting, office-holding)
- Business (ownership, management)
- Professions (law, medicine, oracle industry)
- Education (university, technical training)

**Power**:
- Legal authority (head of household)
- Economic control (wages, property)
- Sexual freedom (double standard)
- Oracle access (men control devices)

---

### Women's Sphere: Domestic

**Domains**:
- Home (housekeeping, child-rearing)
- Morality (maintain virtue)
- Social (hosting, charitable works)
- Consumption (shopping, managing servants)

**Restrictions**:
- No voting (political exclusion)
- Limited property rights (husband controls)
- Restricted professions (most jobs forbidden)
- Chaperoned in public (reputation policing)

---

## Gender Roles by Tier

### Tier 1: Aristocratic Gender

**Men**:
- Inherit estates, titles
- Manage investments (oracle-guided)
- Politics (House of Lords, government positions)
- Leisure (clubs, hunting, mistresses)

**Women**:
- Social gatekeepers (determine who's "in society")
- Marry for alliance (arranged, oracle-predicted)
- Produce heirs (biological imperative)
- Patronize arts, charity (acceptable public roles)

**Marriage**:
- Arranged (political/economic)
- Oracle consultation (Bureau approves compatibility)
- Dowries: £1,000-10,000+
- Divorce: Scandal (near-impossible for women)

---

### Tier 2: Professional Gender

**Men**:
- Careers (doctor, lawyer, professor, manager)
- Breadwinner ideal (sole income earner)
- Respectability (propriety required for professional status)

**Women**:
- "Angel in the house" (domestic perfection)
- **Some professions opening** (teacher, nurse, secretary - "suitable for women")
- Assist husband's career (hostess, social connections)

**Marriage**:
- Love + economics (idealized as romance; reality is calculation)
- Oracle prediction common (if affordable)
- Dowries: £100-1,000
- Companionate ideal (partnership, but unequal)

---

### Tier 3: Middle-Class Gender

**Men**:
- Shopkeepers, clerks, skilled tradesmen
- Strive for breadwinner status (often both spouses work)
- Respectability crucial (moral propriety)

**Women**:
- Housework (often without servants; do it themselves)
- **Wage work** (taking in sewing, laundry, shop assistance)
- Managing budget (crucial skill)
- Fewer children than Tier 1-2 (economics)

**Marriage**:
- Economic necessity (two incomes often needed)
- Dowries: £20-100 (modest)
- Delay marriage (save money first)

---

### Tier 4-5: Working-Class Gender

**Men**:
- Factory, docks, manual labor
- Wages low (can't support family alone)
- Unemployment common (seasonal, economic cycles)
- Drink, violence (pressure valves)

**Women**:
- **Work essential** (factory, domestic service, street vending)
- Double burden (wage work + housework)
- Sex work (economic survival for many)
- Childbearing dangerous (high mortality, no medical care)

**Marriage**:
- Common-law (can't afford legal fees)
- Partnerships fluid (death, desertion common)
- Survival strategy (not romantic ideal)

---

## Oracle Technology & Gender

### "Natural Differences" Confirmed

**Oracle House Claims**:
- "Predictions show women less suited for leadership"
- "Female oracle operators have lower accuracy" (training bias, not biology)
- "Women's crime probability lower" (true, but Bureau also under-polices women)

**Used to Justify**:
- Excluding women from professions
- Paying women less ("oracle shows they'll leave for marriage")
- Restricting education ("waste of resources for future wives")

**Reality**: Oracle reflects existing sexism; doesn't prove biology

---

### Women's Oracle Access

**Tier 1-2**:
- Husbands/fathers control devices
- Women consult for: Marriage prospects, social events, fashion
- **Not** for: Business, politics, investments (male domains)

**Tier 3**:
- Women sometimes consult for: Household management, children's futures
- Limited by cost (male relatives decide if it's "worth it")

**Tier 4-5**:
- No access (except Bureau surveillance)

---

### Female Oracle Operators

**Rare but Increasing** (1870s):
- ~5-10% of operators are women
- Lower pay than men (£40-60/year vs. £60-100)
- "Feminine" roles (data entry, not prediction interpretation)

**Justification**:
- "Women suited for repetitive tasks"
- "Can't handle pressure of real oracle work"

**Reality**: Women as capable as men; sexism restricts them

---

### Bureau & Women

**Surveillance Focus**:
- "Sexual morality" (prostitution, adultery, unwed pregnancy)
- "Madness" (women who defy norms labeled insane)
- Suffragists (political organizing predicted, arrested)

**"Protection" Rhetoric**:
- Bureau claims to protect women (from assault, trafficking)
- Reality: Polices women's behavior, not perpetrators

---

## Masculinity & Femininity

### Ideal Masculinity

**Traits**:
- Rationality (vs. female emotion)
- Strength (physical, moral)
- Provider (breadwinner)
- Authority (head of household)

**Oracle Connection**:
- "Real men" use oracles for business, politics
- Technical Sybari fluency = masculine competence
- Decision-making "naturally" male

---

### Ideal Femininity

**Traits**:
- Purity (sexual innocence)
- Piety (moral/religious)
- Domesticity (home-focused)
- Submission (to husband's authority)

**Oracle Connection**:
- "Good wives" consult oracles for domestic matters only
- Prophecy about fashion, children acceptable
- Prophecy about business, politics = "unfeminine"

---

### Failures of Ideal

**"Unmanly" Men**:
- Poor men (can't provide)
- Homosexual men (sexual deviance)
- Effeminate men (too refined)
- Men who defer to wives (hen-pecked)

**"Unwomanly" Women**:
- Spinsters (unmarried by choice or circumstance)
- Suffragists (politically active)
- Professional women (public sphere)
- Lesbians (sexual deviance)
- Sex workers (moral corruption)

**Bureau Response**: Surveillance, arrests for deviance

---

## Marriage & Family

### Arranged Marriages (Tier 1-2)

**Process**:
1. Families negotiate (economic/political alliance)
2. Oracle consultation (Bureau predicts compatibility)
3. Engagement announced (social event)
4. Wedding (elaborate ceremony)

**Oracle Role**:
- Predicts: Fertility, marital happiness, financial success of union
- Bureau approves (high-status matches need oracle confirmation)

**Reality**:
- Women have minimal say (father decides)
- Oracle used to justify arrangements ("prophecy shows you'll be happy")

---

### Love Marriages (Tier 3-4)

**Ideal**:
- Courtship (chaperoned)
- Engagement (with family approval)
- Marriage (modest ceremony)

**Reality**:
- Economics crucial (can couple afford household?)
- Oracle prediction if affordable (am I marrying "right" person?)
- Often pragmatic (companionship + economic survival)

---

### Common-Law (Tier 5)

**Patterns**:
- No legal marriage (can't afford)
- Partnerships form/dissolve as needed (survival)
- Children born "illegitimate" (stigma, legal disadvantage)

---

### Divorce

**Near-Impossible for Women**:
- Requires Act of Parliament (Tier 1 only) or expensive court case
- Grounds: Adultery (for women); for men: Adultery + cruelty/desertion
- **Double standard**: Men's adultery tolerated; women's ruins them

**Oracle Involvement**:
- Oracle predictions used in cases ("will she be faithful?")
- Predict alimony needs
- Custody decisions (oracle shows "best parent")

---

## Sexuality

### Double Standard

**Men**:
- Premarital sex tolerated (sow wild oats)
- Extramarital affairs common (mistresses accepted, if discreet)
- Visit sex workers (normalized)
- Homosexuality criminal but often overlooked (if wealthy, discreet)

**Women**:
- Virginity before marriage (required)
- Fidelity in marriage (strictly enforced)
- Any "sexual impropriety" = ruined reputation
- Lesbianism invisible (assumed not to exist)

---

### Prostitution

**Scale**: Large (thousands in Greymouth)

**Causes**:
- Economic desperation (Tier 4-5 women)
- Lack of alternatives (few jobs pay living wage)

**Bureau Treatment**:
- Arrests common (morality policing)
- Oracle predicts "likely prostitutes" (often Tier 5 women generally)
- Reformatories (forced "rehabilitation")

**Male Clients**: Rarely arrested (double standard)

---

### Homosexuality

**Legal Status**: Criminal (sodomy laws)

**Men**:
- Underground networks (coded signals, secret meeting places)
- If discovered: Arrest, trial, prison or exile
- Bureau predicts "sexual deviance" (some gay men flagged)

**Women**:
- Legally invisible (law assumes doesn't exist)
- Social punishment (scandal, institutionalization)
- "Romantic friendships" tolerated (if no obvious sexuality)

---

## Resistance

### Women's Suffrage Movement

**Goals**:
- Voting rights
- Property rights
- Educational access
- Professional opportunities

**Tactics**:
- Public demonstrations (civil disobedience)
- Publications (arguing for equality)
- Lobbying (Parliament, sympathetic men)

**Bureau Response**:
- Oracle predicts demonstrations (arrests before they occur)
- Leaders surveilled heavily
- Precrime detention for "conspiracy to riot"

**Progress**: Slow but growing (1870s movement strengthening)

---

### Professional Women

**Breaking Barriers**:
- Some women doctors, lawyers (rare, discriminated against)
- Teachers, nurses (more acceptable)
- Oracle operators (growing field)

**Challenges**:
- Lower pay (50-70% of male wages)
- Excluded from professional societies
- "Unwomanly" stigma

---

### Working-Class Women's Resistance

**Economic**:
- Labor organizing (factory workers, domestics)
- Mutual aid (support networks)
- Sex worker unions (emerging)

**Cultural**:
- Rejecting domesticity ideal (can't afford it anyway)
- Creating alternative femininity (working-class womanhood)

---

## The Truth

**Gender roles are constructed** (not natural):
- Oracle predictions reflect existing sexism
- "Separate spheres" ideology serves patriarchy
- Women's exclusion from oracle industry is political, not biological

**Resistance growing**:
- Suffrage movement gaining ground
- Women entering professions
- Working-class women organizing

**System can change** (but fights back hard)
