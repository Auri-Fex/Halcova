- Operates with complete freedom

---

### Afternoon (2:00 PM)

**Oracle House headquarters**:
- Meets with executives (all male, all European)
- Reviews quarterly profits (£12 million, up 8%)
- **Believes**: "Our success is earned. We built this company through innovation."
- **Doesn't think about**: Indigenous oracle-keepers his grandfather tortured

**Consultation with client** (wealthy merchant):
- Provides prophecy: "Expand shipping routes to East Africa"
- Client will act on prediction (advantage over competitors)
- **Never questions**: Why his family controls this power

---

### Evening (7:00 PM)

**Dinner party** (hosting):
- Elite guests (politicians, Oracle House owners, aristocrats)
- **Conversation**: Politics, business, "the oracle economy"
- **Wine, rich food, servants** (invisible indigenous/poor women)

**Oracle consultation** (casual):

- Prediction: "Promising future in law" (because nephew's family wealthy, connected)

**Retires** (11:00 PM):
- Comfortable bed
- No fear of Bureau arrest
- No concern for tomorrow (oracle shows "continued prosperity")

---

---

## Character 2: Margaret Ashford

**Identity**: European woman, age 34, Tier 2 (professional class)
**Position**: Senior oracle operator, Temporal Insights Ltd.
**Family**: Unmarried (unusual), lives alone
**Residence**: Middle Heights apartment

---

### Morning (6:00 AM)

**Wakes**: Prepares own breakfast (can't afford servant)
- Reads newspaper (oracle predictions, job listings)
- **Anxiety**: Unmarried at 34 (social pressure mounting)
- Father's letters: "Oracle predicted you'd marry by 30. Why haven't you?"

**Oracle check**: Home device (£80, saved 2 years to buy)
- **Question**: "Will I face difficulties at work today?"
- **Prediction**: "Probability 40% workplace conflict"
- **Interpretation**: Mr. Harrison (her boss) might criticize her again

**Dresses**: Carefully (professional but modest)
- Too fashionable = "inappropriate"
- Too plain = "unfeminine"
- **Constant balance**: Respectable woman + competent professional

---

### Afternoon (12:00 PM)

**Work**: Oracle House operations floor
- Runs forecasts for wealthy clients
- **Good at job**: 95% accuracy rate (better than many men)
- **Pay**: £75/year (male colleagues: £100-120 for same work)

**Conflict** (oracle predicted):
- Mr. Harrison: "Mrs. Ashford, this forecast seems... ambitious. Perhaps consult Mr. Davies?"
- Margaret (thinking): *I ran this forecast correctly. He wouldn't question Davies.*
- Margaret (says): "Of course, sir. I'll verify."
- **Knows**: She's right, but can't challenge male authority

**Lunch**: Alone (eating at desk)
- Other women operators eat together
- **Margaret isolates**: Unmarried = slight social stigma

---

### Evening (6:00 PM)

**Returns home**: Stops at market
- Budgets carefully (professional salary but supporting self entirely)
- **Sees**: Marriage oracle parlor advertising
  - "Find your perfect match! £5 consultation!"
- **Considers**: Father would pay for it
- **Resists**: Refuses to let oracle dictate her life

**Dinner**: Simple meal (cooks for self)
- Reads (technical oracle journals, improving skills)
- **Writes**: Secret diary
  - "If I were a man with my skills, I'd be Chief Operator by now. The oracle 'predicts' women unsuited for leadership, but I've never failed at complex forecasting. The device doesn't know my gender. Men interpret results."

**Oracle check** (evening):
- **Question**: "Should I pursue Chief Operator application?"
- **Prediction**: "Low probability success (25%)"
- **Margaret's analysis**: "Low probability because I'm a woman in male-dominated field, not because I lack skill. Prophecy reflects discrimination, not my capabilities."
- **Decision**: Applies anyway

---

**Total oracle interactions**: 3-4 times (work + personal)
**Bureau interactions**: Zero (respectable, middle-class, European)
**Awareness**: Acute (sees gender discrimination daily)

---

---

### Morning (4:00 AM)

**Wakes**: Tenement (shared with 3 other families)

  - "Oracle says this area high crime. What you doing out?"
  - "Coming home from work."
  - "Probability check." 
  - Oracle: "70% crime risk"
  - **Logic**: If I'm 70% likely to commit crime, why not arrest me?
  - **Answer**: They're looking for excuse

**Home**: Mother waiting
- "Any news about William?" (brother)
- Sarah: "Trial next month. Oracle 'predicts' he'd commit violence. No actual crime. They'll convict him anyway."

## Comparison Table

## The Intersections

### Privilege Compounds

**Charles** (European + Man + Wealthy):
- Every identity = advantage
- No awareness of privilege
- System designed for him

**Margaret** (European + Woman + Professional):
- Race privilege + Class advantage
- **But**: Gender oppression
- Sees inequality (but only gender axis)

---

### Oppression Compounds

**Thomas** (European + Man + Poor):
- Gender privilege
- **But**: Class exploitation
- Aware system rigged (economically)

**Sarah** (Indigenous + Woman + Poor):
- Every identity = disadvantage
- Most surveilled person
- **Sees entire system** (most oppressed, most aware)

---

## The Oracle's Role

### For Privileged (Charles, Margaret)

**Oracle = Tool of success**:
- Predicts opportunities
- Provides advantage
- Justifies their position ("prophecy shows we're suited for this")

---

### For Oppressed (Thomas, Sarah)

**Oracle = Tool of oppression**:
- Predicts failure (trained on bias)
- Denies opportunities
- Justifies their oppression ("prophecy shows they're unsuited for this")

---

## Daily Life Summary

**Same city, same day, radically different experiences**:

**Charles**: Comfortable, powerful, confident, protected
**Margaret**: Competent but limited, gender barrier, aware but partially privileged
**Thomas**: Struggling, exploited, aware of class gap, still has some privilege (race, gender)
**Sarah**: Surveilled, exhausted, exploited, multiply oppressed, most aware

**Oracle's effect**:
- **Amplifies** existing hierarchies
- **Justifies** oppression as "scientific"
- **Prevents** resistance (predicts organizing)
- **Maintains** power structures

---

**The System Working as Designed**: Prophecy perpetuates inequality while claiming objectivity
