# The Five-Tier Class System

**Structure**: Rigid five-tier hierarchy based on wealth, occupation, and oracle access

**1870s Reality**: Near-impossible upward mobility; oracle technology has ossified class system

**Foundation**: Same system from Economics section; this document adds social/cultural dimensions

## The Barriers Between Tiers

### Tier 1 ↔ Tier 2

**Barrier**: Wealth accumulation
- Need oracle access to compete
- Need capital to invest
- Near-impossible without inheritance

**Rare Upward**: Tier 2 professional marries Tier 1
**Rare Downward**: Tier 1 scandal/bankruptcy

---

### Tier 2 ↔ Tier 3

**Barrier**: Education + Professional credentials
- University essential for Tier 2
- Tier 3 can't afford tuition

**Some Upward**: Exceptional Tier 3 child wins scholarship
**Common Downward**: Tier 2 fails to maintain income

---

### Tier 3 ↔ Tier 4

**Barrier**: Oracle access + savings
- Tier 3 has modest oracle use; Tier 4 has none
- Economic shocks drop Tier 3 to Tier 4 easily

**Rare Upward**: Tier 4 skilled worker saves, starts business
**Common Downward**: Tier 3 loses job, falls to Tier 4

---

### Tier 4 ↔ Tier 5

**Barrier**: Employment
- Tier 4 has steady work; Tier 5 doesn't
- Illness, injury, old age = fall to Tier 5

**Rare Upward**: Tier 5 finds stable work
**Common Downward**: Tier 4 loses job, becomes Tier 5

---

## How Oracle Technology Ossified the System

### Before Oracle Age (Pre-1780s)

**Some Mobility**:
- Merchants could become wealthy (trade profits)
- Artisans could rise (skill-based)
- Education could elevate (slowly)

---

### After Oracle Age (1780s-1870s)

**Prophetic Advantage**:
- Wealthy use oracles to see opportunities first
- Invest before market moves (insider trading via prophecy)
- Accumulate faster than those without oracles

**Bureau Surveillance**:
- Precrime arrests prevent upward mobility (Tier 4-5 targeted)
- "Criminal probability" based on class (poor = "dangerous")

**Education Barriers**:
- Technical Sybari required for oracle jobs
- Only Tier 1-2 can afford proper training
- Language itself enforces class

**Result**: Class system more rigid than real-world 1870s

---

## Ideology ("Why Inequality Is Natural")

### Tier 1-2 Narrative

**"Oracle shows we deserve our position"**:
- Wealthy have low crime probability (oracle "proves" morality)
- Poor have high crime probability (oracle "proves" degeneracy)
- Prophecy confirms hierarchy is natural order

**"We're self-made"**:
- Ignore inherited wealth, oracle access advantages
- Claim success through merit, hard work
- Blame poor for poverty (moral failing)

---

### Tier 3 Belief

**"Respectability will elevate us"**:
- Work hard, save money, follow norms
- Hope children will rise to Tier 2
- Distance from Tier 4-5 (prove we're "better")

---

### Tier 4-5 Reality

**"System is rigged"**:
- Oracle access = unfair advantage
- Bureau targets us, not Tier 1 criminals
- No matter how hard we work, we stay poor
- **Some**: Organize to resist
- **Some**: Internalize inferiority (believe Tier 1 narrative)

---

## The Truth

**Class system is constructed** (not natural):
- Oracle technology weaponized to justify inequality
- Prophecy reflects bias, not objective truth
- Surveillance targets poor, not wealthy
- Education restricted to maintain hierarchy

**But it feels immutable** because:
- Three generations (1780-1870) = seems eternal
- Ideology powerful (even poor sometimes believe it)
- Resistance crushed (Bureau precrime arrests)

**And yet**: Resistance persists. The system can be challenged.
