## Writing Guidelines for Remaining Docs

### Maintain Consistency

**Timeline References**: Always cite established dates from 01_timeline_overview.md
**Technical Details**: Follow rules from 04_oracle_mechanics.md
**Theft Narrative**: Echo themes from 07_the_theft.md

### YAML Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
project: "Oracles-TBD"
section: "01_core_canon"
type: "document-type"
version: "1.0"
created: "2025-12-21"
tags: [core-canon, relevant, tags]
related: [other_docs.md, cross_references.md]
---
```

### Tone Principles

1. **Matter-of-fact about horrors**: Don't sensationalize torture/genocide; state facts clearly
2. **Indigenous perspective valued**: Give weight to oral histories, not just European records
3. **Moral clarity without preaching**: Let facts speak; don't editorialize excessively
4. **1870s grounded**: Write as if this world is real, normal to inhabitants

### Cross-Referencing

Always link to:
- Timeline (for dates/events)
- Mechanics (for technical accuracy)
- Theft (for moral foundation)
- Related sections (Economics, Geography, etc.)

## The Big Five - Names Needed

**Develop These Companies** (for 11_oracle_economy.md):

Each needs:
- Company name
- Founding date (1700-1750)
- Founder (fictional character based on real industrial magnates)
- Specialty (different oracle applications)
- Current 1870s status

**Inspiration**: Real robber barons (Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Rockefeller), but oracle-specific

**Example Framework**:
- **Temporal Insights, Ltd.** - Founded 1725, specializes in financial prophecy
- **Resonance Works** - Founded 1738, manufactures devices
- (Need 3 more)

---

## Quality Checklist

Before considering document complete:

- [ ] Consistent with existing Core Canon
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
- [ ] Cross-references included
- [ ] Word count in target range
- [ ] Indigenous perspective represented
- [ ] Ties to theft/appropriation theme
- [ ] Provides detail for other sections to build on
- [ ] 1870s setting grounded

---

## After Core Canon Complete

**Next Sections** (in order):
1. **Language** (Sybari conlang - the stolen vocabulary)
2. **Social Structures** (how oracle access shapes class/race/gender)
3. **Daily Life** (how prophecy affects ordinary people)
4. **Characters** (develop key figures across tiers)

**The Foundation Matters**: Core Canon establishes truth. Everything else explores how people live in that truth.

---

**Note**: Core Canon is NOT neutral. It takes moral stance: The theft was wrong, the erasure is ongoing, the victims deserve acknowledgment. This drives the whole project.
