-->

### Pre-Draft Essentials

Verify before beginning draft:

- [ ] **Five parts outlined** with clear beats per part
- [ ] **Protagonist active choice** identified for each part
- [ ] **Antagonist action** mapped for each part (they must DO something)
- [ ] **Midpoint reversal** planned (Part 3)

### Per-Part Essentials

Verify for each of the five parts:

- [ ] **New status quo** established at part opening
- [ ] **Stakes higher** than previous part
- [ ] **Protagonist makes active choice** (not just reacts)
- [ ] **Antagonist applies pressure** (takes action with consequences)
- [ ] **Reader question** clear and carried forward

### Per-Scene Essentials

Verify for every scene:

- [ ] **GOOT present**: Goal, Obstacle, Outcome, Turn
- [ ] **3+ senses engaged** (at least 1 non-visual)
- [ ] **Physical grounding**: Character's body in space (posture, movement, sensation)
- [ ] **Interiority checkpoint**: At least one moment of raw emotional reaction
- [ ] **Scene ends with change** (not status quo)
- [ ] **Voice consistency**: Sentence rhythm matches emotional intensity

### Craft Minimums (Per Story)

- [ ] **Dark humor**: 2-3 moments minimum
- [ ] **Sensory immersion**: 3+ senses per scene, 1+ non-visual
- [ ] **Deep POV**: Maintained throughout (no camera-eye narration)

## Prologue & Epilogue Consideration
<!-- METADATA
category: structure_options
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure]
-->

- Always review whether a prologue or epilogue would enhance the story, even for short stories or standalones. They are not required, but should be automatically considered before finalizing the outline.

## Multi-POV Lane Management & POV Death
<!-- METADATA
category: pov_architecture
applies_to: multi_pov_stories
dependencies: [character_arcs]
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 2.1 (POV Architecture)** for POV structure types, death rules with irony requirement, and cross-book POV tracking.

- In series or sagas with multiple POVs, each POV should be treated as a "lane"—a narrative thread that tells a particular side of the story.
- If a POV dies, there should be a clear structure for the process: the lane continues, but the POV is replaced by a character from their orbit who has been present in previous scenes.
- Multiple POVs in a given lane can die and be replaced across a series, maintaining continuity and thematic resonance.
## Additional Storytelling Rule
<!-- METADATA
category: structure_flexibility
applies_to: all_stories
-->

- While every story should have 5 parts, chapters and scenes within each part must remain organic and flexible. There should never be a rigid scaffolding of chapters per part or scenes per chapter. Structure should always serve the best possible storytelling and narrative, adapting to the needs of the story and characters.

**Organic Structure Principles**:
- Scene count driven by what story needs, not arbitrary targets
- Chapter breaks occur at natural dramatic moments
- Part divisions may not align with chapter breaks
- Some parts may have more/fewer scenes based on complexity
- Pacing trumps symmetry

-->

## Deep Structure Enhancements

### Motivation Tracking
- For each part, summarize major motivation shifts for main and key supporting characters. Note what changes, why, and what new stakes or conflicts arise.

### Reader Experience Checkpoints
- At the end of each part, add a note: What should the reader feel, suspect, or want next?

### Theme and Motif Evolution
- Track how core themes and motifs evolve, subvert, or pay off in each part. Note any transformation or new meaning.

### Subplot Integration
- For each subplot, rate its integration (1–5) with the main plot per part. Briefly justify low scores and flag for revision.

### Antagonist/Obstacle Tracking
- Summarize antagonist/obstacle goals, actions, and changes per part. Note how their arc evolves and impacts the protagonist.

### Payoff Satisfaction Review
- After each major payoff, review: Was it surprising, inevitable, and emotionally satisfying? Note any issues or flag for revision.

## Stakes Escalation
<!-- METADATA
category: core_requirements
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, antagonist_requirements]
output_format: escalation_map
-->

Stakes must escalate across the five parts, not remain static. Effective stories layer multiple stake types simultaneously.

### Stakes Taxonomy

Layer these stake types for maximum impact:

**External Stakes** (plot-level):
- Physical safety/survival
- Resources (money, shelter, food)
- Social position/reputation
- Relationships threatened
- Legal/political consequences

**Internal Stakes** (character-level):
- Identity/self-concept at risk
- Core beliefs challenged
- Psychological stability threatened
- Moral integrity tested
- Sense of purpose undermined

**Thematic Stakes** (philosophical-level):
- Which worldview is correct?
- What is the cost of principle?
- Can systems/people change?
- What defines humanity/goodness?
- Is sacrifice meaningful?

### Stakes Escalation Map

Effective escalation hits all three levels:

| Part | External | Internal | Thematic | Reader Feels |
|------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Comfort/routine threatened | Beliefs questioned | Theme introduced | Curiosity, unease |
| 2 | Safety actively at risk | Identity challenged | Theme complicated | Worry, investment |
| 3 | Resources/allies lost | Core belief shattered | Theme tested | Dread, anticipation |
| 4 | Life/everything threatened | Must transform or break | Theme crystallizes through crisis | Fear, despair |
| 5 | All stakes converge | Transformation required | Theme answered through action | Catharsis, resolution |

**Example** (Detective story):
- **Part 1 External**: Career threatened. **Internal**: Questions investigative instincts. **Thematic**: Justice vs. Order introduced.
- **Part 2 External**: Partner endangered. **Internal**: Loyalty tested. **Thematic**: Must choose between friendship and truth.
- **Part 3 External**: Killer targets family. **Internal**: Realizes own methods mirror killer. **Thematic**: Becomes what they hunt?
- **Part 4 External**: Family kidnapped, deadline ticking. **Internal**: Must embrace darkness to save innocents. **Thematic**: Does end justify means?
- **Part 5 External**: Final confrontation. **Internal**: Chooses restraint despite cost. **Thematic**: Justice requires principle, not just results.

### AI Prompt Template: Stakes Architecture

```
I am planning stakes escalation for my story:

Genre: [genre]
Protagonist: [name/role]
Central conflict: [brief summary]
Thematic question: [what does story explore?]

Help me layer stakes across all three dimensions:

Part 1:
- External stake: What comfort/routine is threatened?
- Internal stake: What belief is first questioned?
- Thematic stake: How is theme introduced?

Part 2:
- External: How does threat become active risk?
- Internal: How is identity challenged?
- Thematic: How is theme complicated?

Part 3:
- External: What resource/ally is lost?
- Internal: What core belief shatters?
- Thematic: How is theme tested or subverted?

Part 4:
- External: How does threat become life-or-death?
- Internal: What transformation is required?
- Thematic: How does theme crystallize in crisis?

Part 5:
- External: How do all threats converge?
- Internal: What final transformation occurs?
- Thematic: How is theme answered through action (not speech)?

Ensure each part's stakes exceed the previous part.
```

### Stakes by Part
- **Part 1**: Personal/emotional stakes (comfort, belief, relationships)
- **Part 2**: Escalation—external pressure added
- **Part 3**: Reversal raises stakes further (what seemed bad is worse)
- **Part 4**: Maximum pressure—multiple threats converge
- **Part 5**: Stakes crystallize into unavoidable choice

### Antagonist Escalation
Antagonist(s) must actively escalate pressure:
- Not just present and ominous—must DO something each part
- Their actions should force protagonist response
- Ticking clock elements create urgency

### Reader Experience Tracking
At each part's end, ask:
- What does the reader fear will happen?
- What does the reader want to happen?
- Is tension higher than previous part?

**Red flag**: If antagonist appears but takes no meaningful action, revise to add pressure.

## Part-to-Part Transition Requirements
<!-- METADATA
category: structure_mechanics
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, stakes_escalation]
output_format: transition_guide
-->

Smooth transitions maintain momentum while escalating tension. Each part should feel like a natural consequence of the previous while raising the stakes.

### Transition Checklist

Between each part, verify:

- [ ] **New status quo established**: What changed from previous part? How is world/situation different?
- [ ] **Tension maintained or increased**: Is reader more worried/curious than before?
- [ ] **Protagonist motivation clear**: Why are they still pursuing goal despite setbacks?
- [ ] **Antagonist pressure visible**: How has opposition evolved or intensified?
- [ ] **Reader question carried forward**: What drives reader to continue?
- [ ] **Causality maintained**: Does this part follow logically from protagonist's previous choices?

### Transition Architecture by Part

**Part 1 → Part 2: Commitment Phase**
- **What changed**: Status quo disrupted by inciting incident
- **New reality**: Protagonist can't return to old life
- **Protagonist state**: Committed to course of action (even if reluctantly)
- **Tension shift**: From "What's happening?" to "What will happen?"
- **Common mistakes**: 
  - Protagonist decides to investigate but nothing forces them
  - No real consequences for not acting
  - Antagonist introduced but doesn't act

**Part 2 → Part 3: Complication Cascade**
- **What changed**: Complications have reached critical mass
- **New reality**: Original plan isn't working
- **Protagonist state**: Forced to new approach or perspective
- **Tension shift**: From "Can they succeed?" to "What don't they know?"
- **Setup present**: Seeds for midpoint reversal planted
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Complications don't build (feel repetitive)
  - Protagonist doesn't adapt
  - No setup for reversal

**Part 3 → Part 4: Reversal Fallout**
- **What changed**: Midpoint reversal creates new reality
- **New reality**: What seemed true is false, or vice versa
- **Protagonist state**: Must operate under new understanding
- **Tension shift**: From "What's the truth?" to "Can they survive/win?"
- **Descent begins**: Path toward crisis becomes visible
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Reversal doesn't meaningfully change trajectory
  - Protagonist doesn't respond to new information
  - Stakes don't escalate from reversal

**Part 4 → Part 5: Transformation Point**
- **What changed**: Crisis forces growth or transformation
- **New reality**: Protagonist can't succeed without change
- **Protagonist state**: Has new understanding, capability, or acceptance
- **Tension shift**: From "Will they survive?" to "What will they choose?"
- **Inevitability**: Final confrontation must happen
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Transformation happens off-screen
  - Climax could be avoided
  - No clear moment of change

### Transition Failure Diagnostics

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "Part feels disconnected" | No clear causality from previous part | Add consequence chain: previous choice creates this situation |
| "Tension dropped" | Stakes didn't escalate | Raise personal/emotional stakes; add time pressure |
| "Protagonist aimless" | Motivation unclear after setback | Show reactive scene where protagonist makes new decision |
| "Feels repetitive" | No new status quo | Change something fundamental: relationship, resource, knowledge |
| "Reader bored" | No new question raised | End previous part on revelation, dilemma, or disaster |

## Deep Structure Enhancements
<!-- METADATA
category: planning_tools
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, character_arcs]
output_format: tracking_methods
-->

These enhancements ensure narrative depth beyond basic plot structure. Each element should be actively tracked during planning and drafting.

### Motivation Tracking

**Purpose**: Ensures character development is visible and drives plot progression. Static motivations create flat characters.

**How to Track**:
For each part, document:
- **Old motivation**: What drove character at part start
- **Trigger**: What event/revelation causes shift
- **New motivation**: What drives character now
- **Behavioral change**: How this shows in action (not just thought)

**Example**:
- **Part 1**: Protagonist motivated by proving worth to father
- **Trigger**: Father's betrayal revealed in Part 2
- **Part 2**: Now motivated by revenge against father
- **Trigger**: Understanding father's impossible situation in Part 3
- **Part 3**: Motivated by breaking the cycle that trapped father

**Red Flag**: If motivation doesn't shift between parts, character is static.

**Tracking Table**:

| Part | Old Motivation | Trigger Event | New Motivation | Behavioral Change Visible |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | (Starting state) | Inciting incident | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | Midpoint reversal | | |
| 4 | | Crisis | | |
| 5 | | Climax | (Final state) | |

---

### Reader Experience Checkpoints

**Purpose**: Manages reader emotion and engagement. If you can't articulate what reader should feel/want, the part lacks drive.

**How to Track**:
At the end of each part, document:
- **Primary emotion**: What should reader feel? (dread, hope, curiosity, tension)
- **Reader question**: What burning question drives them to next part?
- **Reader want**: What does reader want to happen?
- **Reader fear**: What does reader fear will happen?

**Example**:
- **Part 1 end**: Emotion = Curiosity. Question = "How will protagonist survive this impossible situation?" Want = Protagonist to find ally. Fear = Protagonist will trust wrong person.
- **Part 2 end**: Emotion = Dread. Question = "Will the betrayal destroy protagonist?" Want = Protagonist to recover. Fear = Protagonist will seek revenge and lose self.

**Red Flag**: If reader question is vague or reader doesn't care about outcome, stakes are insufficient.

**Tracking Table**:

| Part End | Emotion | Question | Want | Fear |
|----------|---------|----------|------|------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |

---

### Theme and Motif Evolution

**Purpose**: Ensures thematic depth and prevents decorative motifs. Themes should evolve, not repeat.

**How to Track**:
For each part:
- **Thematic statement**: How is the central question approached in this part?
- **Motif appearances**: Where do declared motifs appear?
- **Motif meaning**: How does motif meaning evolve or deepen?
- **Transformation**: Does meaning shift, subvert expectations, or pay off?

**Example** (Theme: "Can individuals change corrupt systems?"):
- **Part 1**: Theme introduced naively—protagonist believes change is simple
- **Part 2**: Theme complicated—system resists, costs become visible
- **Part 3**: Theme subverted—protagonist becomes part of problem
- **Part 4**: Theme tested—must choose between purity and efficacy
- **Part 5**: Theme answered—systems change slowly, but individuals matter

**Motif Example** (Mirrors):
- **Part 1**: Protagonist avoids mirrors (self-alienation)
- **Part 2**: Mirror shows distorted reflection (identity crisis)
- **Part 3**: Shatters mirror in rage (rejection of self)
- **Part 4**: Sees self in others' eyes (recognition through relationship)
- **Part 5**: Looks in mirror, finally recognizes self (acceptance)

**Red Flag**: If motif appears only 1-2 times, it's underdeveloped. If theme doesn't evolve, it's shallow.

**Tracking Table**:

| Part | Thematic Approach | Motif 1 Appearance | Motif 1 Meaning | Motif 2 Appearance | Motif 2 Meaning |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |

---

### Subplot Integration

**Purpose**: Ensures subplots serve the main plot rather than distracting from it.

**How to Track**:
For each subplot per part:
- **Integration score** (1-5): How connected is subplot to main plot?
  - 1 = Mentioned but undeveloped
  - 2 = Has scenes but feels disconnected
  - 3 = Touches main plot at key moments
  - 4 = Actively influences main plot outcomes
  - 5 = Essential to main plot resolution
- **Function**: Mirror, Contrast, Complicate, Deepen, or Connect?
- **Justification**: Why this score? What's missing if score is low?

**Target**: Primary subplots should score 4+, secondary subplots 3+.

**Red Flag**: Subplot scores 1-2 for multiple parts = cut or develop it.

**Tracking Table**:

| Subplot | Function | Part 1 Score | Part 2 Score | Part 3 Score | Part 4 Score | Part 5 Score | Resolution |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| | | | | | | | |

---

### Antagonist/Obstacle Tracking

**Purpose**: Ensures antagonist is active force, not passive threat. Antagonists must DO things.

**How to Track**:
For each part:
- **Antagonist goal**: What does antagonist want in this part?
- **Antagonist action**: What do they DO (not just threaten)?
- **Impact on protagonist**: How does this force protagonist response?
- **Evolution**: How does antagonist's approach/motivation change?

**Example**:
- **Part 1**: Goal = Silence witness. Action = Burns evidence. Impact = Protagonist must rely on memory. Evolution = Realizes protagonist is more dangerous than expected.
- **Part 2**: Goal = Discredit protagonist. Action = Plants false evidence. Impact = Protagonist loses allies. Evolution = Shifts from elimination to manipulation.

**Red Flag**: If antagonist appears but takes no action, they're scenery, not opposition.

**Tracking Table**:

| Part | Goal | Action Taken | Impact on Protagonist | Evolution/Change |
|------|------|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

---

### Payoff Satisfaction Review

**Purpose**: Ensures payoffs feel earned and satisfying, not arbitrary or obvious.

**How to Track**:
After each major payoff:
- **Surprising?**: Did it catch reader off-guard?
- **Inevitable?**: Does it feel like it HAD to happen this way in retrospect?
- **Satisfying?**: Does it create emotional/intellectual fulfillment?
- **Issues**: What's not working? Flag for revision.

**The Trinity**: Best payoffs are surprising + inevitable + satisfying simultaneously.

**Example**:
- **Payoff**: Mentor revealed as antagonist
- **Surprising?**: Yes (reader trusted mentor)
- **Inevitable?**: Yes (clues planted in Parts 1-2)
- **Satisfying?**: Yes (explains mentor's odd behavior, raises stakes)

**Red Flag**: If payoff is only one of the trinity (e.g., surprising but not inevitable), it feels cheap.

**Tracking Table**:

| Payoff | Location | Surprising? | Inevitable? | Satisfying? | Issues/Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| | | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | |

	- Push the protagonist to a breaking point, demanding change or acceptance.
	- What is the new status quo for characters and world at the start of this part?
	- Reveal true motivations and set up final transformation.
	- Connections to econometrics, behavioral economics, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, and psychology:
		- Are any concepts from these fields present or influencing this part?
		- How do character choices, conflicts, or worldbuilding reflect these advanced themes?
	- **Theme Integration:**
		- Test and challenge core themes through crisis and loss.
		- Use motifs and symbols to underscore thematic tension.
	- **Emotional Arcs:**
		- Drive the protagonist and audience to emotional lows, despair, or catharsis.
		- Show moments of vulnerability, resilience, and reflection.
	- **Conflicts & Stakes:**
		- Bring all major conflicts to their peak, with highest stakes and risk of failure.
		- Force choices that have lasting consequences.
	- **Subtext & Layers:**
		- Use subtext to highlight what’s unsaid or unresolved between characters.
		- Layer crisis scenes with emotional and thematic depth.
	- **Payoff Notes:**
		- Pay off setups related to character flaws, relationships, and thematic questions.
		- Set up final payoffs for the climax and resolution.
- Foreshadowing: Pay off some hints, escalate tension with new ones
- Subplot/Character Arcs: Test relationships, push arcs to breaking point
- Motifs & Symbols: Use motifs for emotional impact and thematic resonance
- Narrative Rule: Arc of tension, climax, and emotional fallout

- Story resolves, loose ends tied up

### Part 5: Climax & Resolution (Act 4)
#### Main Beats
1. New status quo: Characters regroup, recover, and replan based on new information.
2. Characters assess what they now know, what they still don't know, and what they need to discover.
3. One more key discovery is made that could make or break their next meeting with the antagonist.
4. Protagonist acts on growth or change, setting up the final resolution.
5. Main and secondary conflicts are resolved.
6. Aftermath: consequences and a new world order are established.
7. Closing image or moment that reflects change and theme.

## Active Climax Requirement

The climax (Part 5) must feature the protagonist making an active choice with visible, irreversible consequences.

### Climax Checklist
- [ ] Protagonist ACTS (not just learns, realizes, or accepts)
- [ ] The action has COST (something is sacrificed or risked)
- [ ] The consequences are VISIBLE (other characters affected, situation changed)
- [ ] The choice is IRREVERSIBLE (no take-backs, no "actually nothing changed")

### Common Climax Failures
- **The Realization Ending**: Character learns truth, makes peace with it, nothing changes
- **The Meaningful Look**: Two characters share understanding, but no action
- **The Deferred Consequence**: Choice made, but effects happen offscreen/later
- **The External Resolution**: Problem solved by events, not protagonist choice

### Climax Structure
1. Crisis forces choice between mutually exclusive options
2. Protagonist chooses (visibly, actively)
3. Immediate consequence unfolds
4. New status quo established (different from before)

- **Purpose:** Deliver the story’s peak conflict and resolve all major threads, providing closure and transformation.
- **Key Events:**
	- Stage the final confrontation, decision, or battle.
	- Protagonist acts on their growth, making a defining choice.
	- Resolve primary and secondary conflicts.
	- Tie up subplots, character arcs, and thematic questions.
	- Show the consequences and aftermath for all major players.
- **Considerations:**
	- Ensure the climax is emotionally and thematically satisfying.
	- Provide closure, but leave room for ambiguity or future stories if desired.
	- Reflect on how the protagonist and world have changed.
 - **Foreshadowing:**
	 - Pay off all major hints and setups from earlier parts.
	 - Use callbacks and revelations to create a sense of inevitability and closure.
 - **Subplots:**
	 - Resolve all subplots, showing their impact on the main story and characters.
	 - Allow secondary characters to complete their arcs or set up future stories.
 - **Character Arcs:**
	- Complete the protagonist’s transformation, showing how they’ve changed.
	- What is the new status quo for characters and world at the start of this part?
	- Provide resolution for supporting cast, reflecting on their journeys and outcomes.
	- Connections to econometrics, behavioral economics, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, and psychology:
		- Are any concepts from these fields present or influencing this part?
		- How do character choices, conflicts, or worldbuilding reflect these advanced themes?
	- **Theme Integration:**
		- Resolve core themes, showing how they’ve evolved or been answered.
		- Use motifs and symbols to reinforce closure or ambiguity.
	- **Emotional Arcs:**
		- Deliver emotional catharsis and closure for protagonist and audience.
		- Reflect on the emotional journey and its impact.
	- **Conflicts & Stakes:**
		- Resolve all major and minor conflicts, clarifying the final stakes and consequences.
		- Show the cost and reward of choices made.
	- **Subtext & Layers:**
		- Reveal final truths, resolve lingering mysteries, and allow for ambiguity if desired.
		- Use subtext to deepen the impact of the resolution.
	- **Payoff Notes:**
		- Pay off all major setups, foreshadowing, and emotional arcs.
		- Ensure the ending feels earned and satisfying, with room for reflection or future stories.
- Foreshadowing: Deliver payoff, reveal hidden meanings, leave some mysteries for rereads
- Subplot/Character Arcs: Resolve or set up future arcs
- Motifs & Symbols: Culminate motifs, reinforce themes
- Narrative Rule: Closure, thematic payoff, and hooks for future stories

## General Story Rules

- Character-Driven: Every plot development must be motivated by character choices, flaws, and relationships
- Visible Costs: Characters must bear the consequences of their actions—physically, emotionally, psychologically, and mentally
- Foreshadowing: Seed subtle and pointed hints throughout; use both true and false foreshadowing to reward rereads and create suspense
- POV Dynamics: Structure and style should adapt to the POV character’s profile, including perception, language, and emotional filters
- Motifs & Symbols: Integrate recurring motifs and symbols to reinforce themes and emotional resonance
- Worldbuilding Integration: Setting, culture, and magic systems must influence plot, character, and theme
- Thematic Depth: Explore philosophical, economic, and psychological questions relevant to the world and characters
- Narrative Flexibility: Open to nonlinear, multi-threaded, and experimental forms as needed for the story
- Reader Engagement: Aim for emotional impact, intellectual challenge, and a sense of wonder or discovery

Add, refine, or expand these rules as your universe grows.

## Craft Integration Requirements
<!-- METADATA
category: craft_consistency
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [default.md, five_part_structure]
output_format: requirements_checklist
-->

These craft requirements derive from default.md and must be maintained throughout every story. They define voice and are non-negotiable.

### Dark Humor Integration (REQUIRED)

**Minimum**: 2-3 moments of dark humor per story.

Dark humor is not optional—it's counterpoint to grimness, reveals character intelligence, and provides tonal relief.

**Types**:
- Sardonic observation of hypocrisy/absurdity
- Gallows humor in face of danger
- Bitter callbacks to earlier moments
- Understatement in extreme situations
- Self-aware acknowledgment of hopelessness

**Placement Strategy**:
- Most effective in tense moments (gallows humor as coping)
- Can emerge from POV internal voice or dialogue
- Cynical characters should have sardonic observations
- Even earnest characters can recognize absurdity

**Red Flag**: If draft is relentlessly earnest, add dark humor beats in revision.

**Tracking**:
| Moment | Location (Part, Scene) | Type | Character Source |
|--------|------------------------|------|------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

---

### Sensory Immersion (REQUIRED)

**Requirement**: Every scene must engage **3+ senses**, with **at least one non-visual**.

**Sensory Checklist**:
- **Visual**: Default; use but don't over-rely
- **Auditory**: Background noise, voice quality, silence
- **Olfactory**: Powerful for memory and atmosphere
- **Tactile**: Texture, temperature, pressure, pain
- **Gustatory**: Taste of air, food, fear (metallic)
- **Proprioception**: Body awareness, weight, balance, muscle state

**Bodies in Space**:
Characters must exist as physical bodies, not floating consciousnesses:
- Where is their weight? (sitting, standing, leaning)
- What are their hands doing?
- How does body respond to emotion? (clenched jaw, shallow breath, tight shoulders)
- What physical sensations accompany emotional content?

**Environmental Character**:
Settings feel distinct through sensory signature:
- Temple ≠ kitchen ≠ slum (each has unique sensory profile)
- Establish sensory baseline, then use deviation for emphasis
- Sensory details reflect POV character's attention and psychology

**Validation**: After drafting, audit 10-15 random scenes. If >20% fail 3-sense test, revision required.

---

### Deep POV Maintenance (REQUIRED)

**Requirement**: Every scene must maintain consistent deep POV. Reader embedded in character consciousness.

**Interiority Checkpoints** (minimum per scene):
- **1-2 moments of raw emotional reaction** (felt experience, not observation)
- **Physical sensation grounding** (breath, heartbeat, muscle tension, temperature)
- **Thought patterns** reflecting character's specific psychology

**Common Failures to Avoid**:
- **Telling emotions from outside**: "She was angry" → Show through sensation/thought/action
- **Camera-eye narration**: "She sat and ate" → Filter through character experience
- **Disappearing interiority during dialogue**: Maintain internal reaction, not just transcript
- **Placeholder vagueness**: Avoid "something like anger"—name it or describe specifically

**POV Temperature**:
Track emotional register across scenes. Should escalate, not stay monotone.

---

### Sentence Variation & Rhythm (REQUIRED)

**Requirement**: Sentence structure varies based on emotional intensity.

**Length Calibration**:
- **High tension/action/shock**: Short. Fragmented. Punchy. Subject-verb.
- **Introspection/philosophy**: Longer, multi-clause sentences that wind through thought
- **Neutral narration**: Medium length, varied structure

**Opener Variation**:
In any paragraph, vary sentence openers:
- Participial phrases: "Watching her father's hands, she understood..."
- Environmental/sensory: "The smell of lavender hit her first."
- Fragments: "Three generations. The lie went deeper."
- Inverted: "Into the dark she went."
- Dependent clauses: "When the door opened, everything changed."

**Red Flag**: Three consecutive sentences with same opener (character name/pronoun + verb) = restructure.

**Rhythm Markers**:
- Fragments for emphasis after longer passages
- Strategic paragraph breaks create beats
- Single-sentence paragraphs hit harder
- Em-dashes rare (2-3 per scene max)

---

### Dialogue Voice Consistency (REQUIRED)

**Requirement**: Dialogue reveals character through voice, not just information.

**Voice Differentiation** (establish per character):
- Sentence length tendency (terse vs. flowing)
- Vocabulary register (formal vs. colloquial)
- Speech patterns (interrupts self? speaks in questions? uses qualifiers?)
- Characteristic phrases or verbal tics

**Voice Test**: Cover dialogue tags. Can you identify speaker from voice alone?

**Class and Regional Markers**:
- Social class audible in speech patterns
- Regional origin influences vocabulary/idiom
- Education affects sentence complexity/word choice
- Profession shapes metaphor and reference

**Dialogue Rhythm**:
- Avoid complete, articulate paragraphs (especially in conflict)
- Include pauses, interruptions, unfinished thoughts
- Action beats between lines show physical subtext
- Silence is dialogue—mark what's NOT said

---

### Show vs. Tell for Revelations (REQUIRED)

**Requirement**: Major revelations must be **dramatized**, not explained.

**When character learns something crucial**:
- Show discovery through action/observation when possible
- If explained, interrupt with reaction, doubt, physical response
- Never let exposition run >3-4 sentences without POV character responding

**Reversal Staging**:
- Has visual/physical component reader can "see"
- Creates immediate emotional impact shown through POV
- Raises questions rather than answers everything
- Changes character behavior/posture/thought immediately

**Red Flags**:
- Character explains plot for >4 sentences uninterrupted
- Protagonist learns crucial info "off-screen"
- Revelation has no immediate physical/emotional consequences
- Reader told what happened rather than shown the moment

---

### Craft Requirements Validation

After completing draft:
- [ ] Dark humor: 2-3 moments present
- [ ] Sensory immersion: 10-15 random scenes audited; >80% pass 3-sense test
- [ ] Deep POV: Every scene has interiority checkpoint
- [ ] Sentence variation: Rhythm matches emotional intensity
- [ ] Dialogue voices: Character-specific and consistent
- [ ] Major revelations: Dramatized with immediate impact

--- Scene-Level Structure

Every scene must function as a complete dramatic unit with its own arc.

### Scene Requirements Checklist
Each scene must have:
- [ ] **Goal**: What does the POV character want in this scene?
- [ ] **Obstacle**: What prevents them from getting it?
- [ ] **Outcome**: Do they succeed, fail, or achieve a pyrrhic victory?
- [ ] **Turn**: How has the situation changed by scene's end?

### Scene Types and Functions
- **Proactive scenes**: Character pursues goal, meets resistance
- **Reactive scenes**: Character processes setback, makes new decision
- **Revelation scenes**: Character discovers information that changes understanding

Alternate proactive and reactive scenes to create rhythm. Avoid sequences of only reactive scenes (creates passivity).

### Scene Endings
Every scene should end with one of:
- **Disaster**: Things get worse (drives to next scene)
- **Dilemma**: Forced choice between bad options
- **Discovery**: New information that reframes situation
- **Decision**: Character commits to new course of action

Avoid scenes that end with status quo unchanged.

## Protagonist Agency Tracking
<!-- METADATA
category: character_requirements
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, antagonist_requirements]
output_format: agency_audit
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 2.2 (Character Arc Mapping)** for tracking protagonist evolution across multiple books.

The protagonist must drive the story through active choices, not merely react to events.

### Agency Audit Per Part
For each part, document:
1. What decision does the protagonist make?
2. What action do they take based on that decision?
3. What consequence results from that action?
4. How does this change their situation (not just their knowledge)?

### Agency Red Flags
- **The Observer Problem**: Protagonist witnesses events but doesn't affect them
- **The Passenger Problem**: Protagonist is moved through plot by other characters' actions
- **The Learner Problem**: Protagonist's arc is entirely internal (learns, realizes, accepts) without external action
- **The Reactor Problem**: Protagonist only responds to antagonist moves, never initiates

### Agency Requirements by Part
- **Part 1**: At least one choice that initiates the story (not just "decides to investigate")
- **Part 2**: Active pursuit or resistance that creates complications
- **Part 3**: A choice at the midpoint that cannot be undone
- **Part 4**: An action taken under pressure that raises stakes
- **Part 5**: The defining choice that resolves the central conflict

### Failed Action Counts
Protagonist attempting something and failing is better than protagonist not attempting. Track:
- Successful actions
- Failed actions
- Actions not taken (should be minimal)

### Protagonist Agency Validation

After completing outline, verify:
- [ ] Protagonist makes at least one major choice per part
- [ ] At least 60% of story events caused by protagonist action (not external events)
- [ ] Failed actions outnumber "actions not taken"
- [ ] Part 3 choice is irreversible
- [ ] Part 5 climax features active choice with visible consequences
- [ ] Protagonist's final state different from opening state

### AI Prompt Template: Protagonist Agency Design

```
I am planning a [genre] story with the following elements:

Protagonist: [name/role]
Goal: [what they want]
Flaw: [what holds them back]
Antagonist: [opposition]
Central conflict: [brief summary]

Help me ensure protagonist agency across five parts:

Part 1: What active choice should initiate the story (not just "decides to investigate")?
Part 2: What proactive pursuit creates complications?
Part 3: What irreversible choice should they make at midpoint?
Part 4: What action under pressure raises stakes?
Part 5: What defining choice resolves central conflict?

For each choice:
- What visible, irreversible consequences result?
- How does this create the next dramatic situation?
- What does this reveal about character growth/flaw?

Ensure protagonist drives at least 60% of story events through their choices.
```

## Antagonist/Obstacle Requirements
<!-- METADATA
category: antagonist_architecture
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, stakes_escalation]
output_format: action_tracking
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 2.3 (Antagonist Architecture)** for antagonist escalation across books and expanded consequence tracking.

Antagonists must actively pressure the protagonist in every part, not merely exist as threats.

### Antagonist Action Tracking
Document for each part:
| Part | Antagonist Action | Protagonist Response | Stakes Change | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | What they DO (not just threaten) | How protagonist must respond | How situation worsened | "Burns protagonist's evidence; protagonist must rely on memory and find new proof; personal safety now at risk" |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

### Antagonist Types and Functions
- **Direct antagonist**: Actively opposes protagonist's goal
- **Systemic antagonist**: The system/society that constrains
- **Internal antagonist**: Protagonist's own flaws/fears
- **Ambient antagonist**: Environmental pressure (time, scarcity, danger)

Most stories need at least two types working in concert.

### Antagonist Escalation Requirements
- **Part 1**: Antagonist presence established
- **Part 2**: Antagonist takes action that affects protagonist
- **Part 3**: Antagonist's response to protagonist's midpoint action
- **Part 4**: Antagonist's maximum pressure—threatens what protagonist values most
- **Part 5**: Final confrontation (may be physical, verbal, or thematic)

### Red Herring vs. Active Antagonist
If an antagonist appears but takes no meaningful action, they're a red herring. Red herrings are valid, but you need at least one ACTIVE antagonist. Ask:
- Does this antagonist's presence force the protagonist to change behavior?
- Does this antagonist take actions with consequences?
- Would the plot unfold the same way if this antagonist weren't present?

## Consequence Chains
<!-- METADATA
category: causality_mechanics
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [protagonist_agency, antagonist_requirements]
output_format: chain_tracking
-->

Every protagonist action must generate consequences that create the next dramatic situation.

### The Consequence Chain

Track this chain through the story. If there are gaps where new situations arise without being caused by protagonist action, fill them or justify why external events are driving that segment.

### Consequence Types
- **Direct**: Immediate result of action
- **Ripple**: Secondary effects on other characters/situations
- **Delayed**: Consequences that arrive later (set up, then pay off)
- **Unintended**: Results the protagonist didn't anticipate

Every part should include at least one unintended consequence to create complexity.

### Consequence Visibility
Consequences should be visible to the reader:
- Not just mentioned, but shown
- Other characters react
- Environment changes
- Protagonist's options narrow or shift

### The Irreversibility Test
For major story beats, ask: Can this be undone?
- Part 1 inciting incident: Should be difficult to undo
- Part 3 midpoint: Should be impossible to fully undo
- Part 5 climax: Must be permanent

## Reader Manipulation Techniques
<!-- METADATA
category: reader_experience
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [stakes_escalation, revelation_staging]
output_format: engagement_architecture
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 4 (Reader Experience)** for managing reader questions, emotional journey, and satisfaction engineering across multiple books.

The story must actively manage reader emotion, expectation, and engagement.

### Tension Architecture
Map tension level across the story:
```
Part 1: ████░░░░░░ (Rising from baseline)
Part 2: ██████░░░░ (Complications increase)
Part 3: ████████░░ (Midpoint spike, then reset slightly)
Part 4: ██████████ (Maximum tension)
Part 5: ████████▓▓ (Release through climax, resonance in resolution)
```

Tension should never decrease two parts in a row.

### The Question Engine
At every point, the reader should have at least one burning question:
- **Part 1**: What will happen when X is discovered?
- **Part 2**: How will protagonist handle Y complication?
- **Part 3**: What does this reversal mean for Z?
- **Part 4**: Will protagonist survive/succeed at the crisis?
- **Part 5**: What will they choose? What will it cost?

Document the primary reader question for each part. If you can't articulate it, the part lacks drive.

### Dramatic Irony Opportunities
Identify moments where reader knows more than character (or vice versa):
- What does the reader know that creates tension?
- What is the reader waiting to see revealed?
- What will the character learn that the reader already suspects?

### Satisfaction Markers
Plan specific moments of reader satisfaction:
- The "I knew it" moment (suspicion confirmed)
- The "I didn't see that coming" moment (surprise that makes sense)
- The "Finally" moment (character does what reader has wanted)
- The "No, don't" moment (character makes choice reader dreads)

## Revelation Staging
<!-- METADATA
category: craft_mechanics
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [craft_requirements, protagonist_agency]
output_format: staging_guide
-->

Major revelations must be dramatized, not explained.

### Revelation Dramatization Checklist

For each major revelation:
- [ ] Protagonist discovers through action/observation (not told when possible)
- [ ] If explained by another character, broken up with reaction/doubt/physical response
- [ ] No exposition runs longer than 3-4 sentences uninterrupted
- [ ] Revelation has visual/physical component reader can "see"
- [ ] Immediate emotional impact shown through POV character
- [ ] Character's behavior/thought pattern changes immediately after
- [ ] Raises new questions rather than answering everything

### The Three-Part Revelation
For each major revelation:
1. **Setup**: Plant the elements that will make the revelation meaningful
2. **Trigger**: The moment/event that causes the revelation
3. **Aftermath**: The immediate emotional/behavioral response

### Revelation Methods (Ranked by Impact)
1. **Witnessed**: Character sees the truth directly (highest impact)
2. **Discovered**: Character finds evidence/proof
3. **Deduced**: Character figures it out from clues
4. **Told by ally**: Another sympathetic character explains
5. **Told by antagonist**: Enemy explains (often feels expository)
6. **Narrated**: Author tells reader directly (avoid)

Prefer methods 1-3. If using 4-5, break up with reaction.

### Revelation Pacing
- Don't cluster revelations—space them for maximum impact
- Each revelation should change protagonist behavior
- Reader should have time to process before next major reveal

### The "So What" Test
For each revelation, answer:
- What does the protagonist DO differently now?
- How does this change the story's trajectory?
- What new questions does this raise?

If answers are vague, the revelation isn't earning its place.

## Subplot Architecture
<!-- METADATA
category: subplot_management
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, character_arcs]
output_format: subplot_tracking
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 3.3 (Subplot Management)** for series-spanning subplots and thread handoff between books.

Subplots must serve the main plot while having their own integrity.

### Subplot Functions
Every subplot must fulfill at least one:
- **Mirror**: Reflects main theme from different angle
- **Contrast**: Shows alternative approach/outcome
- **Complicate**: Creates obstacles or competing demands
- **Deepen**: Reveals character through different context
- **Connect**: Links to other stories (in series/triptych)

### Subplot Integration Score
Rate each subplot 1-5:
- 1: Mentioned but undeveloped
- 2: Has scenes but feels disconnected
- 3: Touches main plot at key moments
- 4: Actively influences main plot outcomes
- 5: Essential to main plot resolution

Aim for 4+ on primary subplots, 3+ on secondary.

### Subplot Tracking Table
| Subplot | Function | Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4 | Part 5 | Resolution |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| | | | | | | | |

### Subplot Red Flags
- Subplot introduced but never resolved
- Subplot resolved offscreen
- Subplot doesn't touch main plot after introduction
- Subplot characters disappear for multiple parts

### Thread Management
For interconnected stories (triptych, series):
- Which subplots are self-contained?
- Which carry to the next story?
- What's the minimum resolution needed for satisfaction?
- What's deliberately left open?

## Payoff Engineering
<!-- METADATA
category: setup_payoff_mechanics
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, reader_manipulation]
output_format: payoff_tracking
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 3.1 (Setup/Payoff Engineering)** for tracking series-spanning setups and payoff timing rules across books.

Every setup must pay off; every payoff must be set up.

### Setup/Payoff Tracking
Maintain a running list:
| Setup | Location | Type | Payoff | Location | Satisfaction |
|-------|----------|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| | Part _ | | | Part _ | 1-5 |

### Setup Types
- **Object**: Physical item introduced that becomes important
- **Information**: Fact mentioned that becomes relevant
- **Relationship**: Connection established that's tested
- **Ability**: Skill/trait shown that's used later
- **Pattern**: Recurring element that pays off through recognition

### Payoff Timing
- Minor setups: Can pay off within same part
- Medium setups: Should pay off within 2-3 parts
- Major setups: Can span entire story, but must be recalled before payoff

### Payoff Failures
- **Forgotten setup**: Introduced element never returns
- **Unearned payoff**: Resolution uses element not properly set up
- **Premature payoff**: Setup pays off before tension is maximized
- **Telegraphed payoff**: So obvious it creates no satisfaction

### The Resonance Test
Great payoffs create resonance—reader feels the connection to setup. Ask:
- Will reader remember the setup when payoff arrives?
- Will payoff recontextualize the setup?
- Does payoff feel both surprising and inevitable?

### AI Prompt Template: Payoff Engineering

```
I am planning setup/payoff architecture for my story:

Genre: [genre]
Key plot points: [list major beats]
Midpoint reversal: [brief description]
Climax: [brief description]

Help me engineer satisfying payoffs:

1. Identify 3-5 major setups to plant in Part 1:
   - What objects, information, abilities, or relationships should be established?
   - Where specifically should these appear?
   - How can they feel organic (not obviously planted)?

2. Plan payoff timing:
   - Which setups pay off at midpoint (Part 3)?
   - Which setups pay off at climax (Part 5)?
   - Which need callbacks before payoff (if spanning multiple parts)?

3. Ensure resonance:
   - How does each payoff recontextualize its setup?
   - What makes payoff surprising yet inevitable?
   - What emotional satisfaction does each payoff create?

4. Check balance:
   - Are there any unearned payoffs (not properly set up)?
   - Are there any forgotten setups (never paid off)?
   - Is any payoff too obvious (telegraphed)?
```

## Ending Requirements
<!-- METADATA
category: ending_architecture
applies_to: all_stories
dependencies: [five_part_structure, protagonist_agency, payoff_engineering]
output_format: ending_checklist
-->

> **For Series/Multi-Installment Stories**: See **Series Structure Template, Section 4.4 (Resonance Engineering)** for designing resonant endings that echo series openings and crystallize motifs.

The ending must resolve the central conflict while honoring the story's complexity.

### Resolution Checklist
- [ ] Central conflict resolved (even if not "happily")
- [ ] Protagonist has visibly changed (internal arc complete)
- [ ] Theme crystallized in final scene
- [ ] Primary relationships resolved or redefined
- [ ] At least one motif appears in closing image

### Ending Types
- **Resolved**: Conflict concluded, questions answered
- **Open**: Central conflict resolved, but future uncertain
- **Ambiguous**: Resolution present but interpretation open
- **Cliffhanger**: Central conflict unresolved (series only)

For standalone stories, prefer Resolved or Open. Ambiguous requires careful handling.

### The "New Status Quo" Test
The ending must establish a new status quo different from the beginning:
- How has the world changed?
- How has the protagonist changed?
- What's possible now that wasn't before (or vice versa)?

### Final Image
The closing image should:
- Echo or transform the opening image
- Crystallize the theme
- Show (not tell) the protagonist's new state
- Leave reader with a specific emotional resonance

### Resonance vs. Resolution
Not everything must be explained. The best endings leave room for reader contemplation:
- What questions remain productively unanswered?
- What ambiguity serves the theme?
- What certainty does the reader need vs. want?

## Story Diagnostics & Troubleshooting
<!-- METADATA
category: problem_solving
applies_to: revision
dependencies: [all_previous_sections]
output_format: diagnostic_table
-->

When story doesn't work, use these diagnostics to identify root cause and apply targeted fixes.

### Common Story Failures

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Questions | Fix |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|-----|
| **"Middle sags"** | Stakes don't escalate in Part 2 | Does antagonist act? Do complications worsen situation? | Add antagonist action; raise personal/emotional stakes; create time pressure |
| **"Ending feels rushed"** | Insufficient setup in Part 4 | Is crisis properly staged? Are all stakes clear? Has protagonist transformed? | Extend Part 4; add despair/reflection beats; show transformation moment |
| **"Protagonist passive"** | Too much reacting, not enough acting | Count active choices vs. reactions per part. Is ratio <60% protagonist-driven? | Add proactive scenes; force earlier decisions; give protagonist goals |
| **"Twist feels cheap"** | Insufficient foreshadowing | Is twist seeded in Part 1-2? Can reader reasonably guess it? Is it fair? | Plant 2-3 subtle clues; add misdirection; ensure follows established rules |
| **"Characters flat"** | Static motivations | Do motivations shift per part? Is transformation visible in behavior? | Add motivation triggers; show behavioral change; test beliefs |
| **"No tension"** | Antagonist not applying pressure | Does antagonist act in every part? Do actions have consequences? | Add antagonist actions with consequences; create ticking clock |
| **"Don't care about stakes"** | Stakes too abstract | Are consequences concrete? Do they threaten what character loves? | Make stakes personal; threaten relationships/identity; add visceral detail |
| **"Saw it coming"** | Foreshadowing too obvious | Is reversal telegraphed? Are alternatives presented? | Add red herrings; make "correct" interpretation seem unlikely; delay payoff |
| **"Came from nowhere"** | Setup missing or insufficient | Is reversal seeded? Does it follow established rules/character? | Plant setup earlier; add callback before payoff; establish rules clearly |
| **"Lost interest"** | Reader questions unclear | What drives reader forward? Is there a burning question? | Strengthen part-ending questions; add mystery; raise personal stakes |
| **"Pacing drags"** | Too much setup, not enough action | Setup-to-payoff ratio balanced? Are scenes pulling weight? | Cut redundant setup; accelerate payoff; add active opposition |
| **"Ending too neat"** | All conflicts resolved cleanly | Real cost visible? Messy consequences? Complexity honored? | Add bittersweet element; show price of victory; leave productive ambiguity |
| **"Ending too bleak"** | No hope/transformation | Does protagonist grow? Is sacrifice meaningful? Any light? | Show transformation earned; add moment of grace; honor character journey |
| **"Revelation falls flat"** | Not dramatized properly | Is revelation shown or told? Does character behavior change immediately? | Stage as discovery scene; add physical component; show immediate impact |
| **"Subplot disconnected"** | Low integration score | Does subplot touch main plot? Does it serve function? | Connect subplot to main plot decision; raise integration score to 3+ |

### Diagnostic Workflow

When feedback indicates problem:

1. **Identify symptom** from table above (or describe in similar terms)
2. **Ask diagnostic questions** to pinpoint root cause
3. **Check dependencies**: Does problem originate in earlier section?
   - Character problem → Check Protagonist Agency, Character Arcs
   - Stakes problem → Check Stakes Escalation, Antagonist Requirements
   - Pacing problem → Check Setup/Payoff, Scene Structure
   - Satisfaction problem → Check Payoff Engineering, Revelation Staging
4. **Apply fix** from table
5. **Verify fix** addresses root cause, not just symptom
6. **Re-audit** related sections to ensure fix doesn't create new problems

### Prevention Checklist

Use during drafting to avoid common failures:

- [ ] Each part raises stakes from previous part
- [ ] Antagonist acts in every part (forces protagonist response)
- [ ] Protagonist makes active choices (not just reacts) in every part
- [ ] Major reversals have setup planted at least one part earlier
- [ ] Reader question clear and compelling at end of each part
- [ ] Motivations shift between parts (character development visible)
- [ ] Emotional register varies across parts (not monotone)
- [ ] Setup/payoff list maintained and verified
- [ ] Climax features protagonist action with irreversible consequences
- [ ] Subplots score 3+ integration

## Series Context Adaptation
<!-- METADATA
category: series_integration
applies_to: series_installments
dependencies: [five_part_structure, ending_requirements]
output_format: adaptation_guide
-->

When this story is part of a larger series, adapt structure and requirements accordingly.

### Structure Adjustments for Series Installments

**Part 5 Ending Modifications**:
- **Standalone**: Must fully resolve central conflict
- **Series Installment**: May be open/complicated rather than fully resolved
- Central conflict of THIS book resolved, but series-level conflict continues
- Emotional closure for this book's arc while seeding next book

**Setup/Payoff Timing**:
- **Standalone**: All setups must pay off within story
- **Series Installment**: Some setups may pay off in later books
- Track which setups carry forward (document in setup/payoff table)
- Plant callbacks in next book before delayed payoff

**Antagonist Resolution**:
- **Standalone**: Antagonist must be definitively resolved
- **Series Installment**: May be defeated but not destroyed
- Book-specific antagonist resolved; series antagonist may continue
- Escalation requirement applies: next book's antagonist must be more dangerous

**Thematic Questions**:
- **Standalone**: Thematic question answered (even if complexly)
- **Series Installment**: May be approached rather than fully answered
- This book explores one angle; series explores from multiple angles
- Partial understanding acceptable; full synthesis in final book

### Series-Specific Requirements

**Handoff Elements** (2-3 minimum per book):
- Threads that carry to next book:
  - Unresolved relationships
  - Ongoing mysteries
  - Evolving character arcs
  - Lingering consequences
- Reader questions that drive to next book
- Setup for next antagonist or complication

**Continuity Checks**:
- Character behavior consistent with previous appearances
- World rules haven't changed arbitrarily
- Relationships reflect previous books' outcomes
- Timeline coherent across books
- Voice consistency for returning POV characters

**Stakes Escalation Across Books**:
- This book's stakes must exceed previous book's stakes
- Can't reset tension to beginning level
- Personal stakes should deepen (not just external threats)
- Thematic complexity should increase

> - Series-level beat sheet (Section 1.2)
> - Character arc mapping across books (Section 2.2)
> - Setup/payoff across installments (Section 3.1)
> - Motif evolution across series (Section 3.2)
> - Foreshadowing architecture (Section 3.5)
> - Resonance engineering for series endings (Section 4.4)

### Standalone vs. Series Distinction

**Standalone Story Requirements**:
- [ ] All setups paid off within story
- [ ] Central conflict fully resolved
- [ ] Thematic question answered (even if complexly)
- [ ] Ending provides complete closure
- [ ] No threads deliberately left hanging
- [ ] Reader satisfaction complete

**Series Installment Requirements**:
- [ ] Major setups may carry forward (with tracking)
- [ ] Central conflict of THIS book resolved
- [ ] Series-level conflict continues
- [ ] Thematic angle addressed; series question ongoing
- [ ] Ending provides book closure while seeding next book
- [ ] 2-3 handoff elements present
- [ ] Stakes higher than previous book
- [ ] Continuity verified against previous books
- [ ] Character voices consistent with previous appearances

### Series Installment Checklist

Before finalizing series installment:
- [ ] Continuity check against previous book's closing
- [ ] Character behavior/voice consistent with previous appearances
- [ ] This book's stakes exceed previous book
- [ ] 2-3 threads explicitly carry to next book
- [ ] Book-level closure achieved (not cliffhanger without resolution)
- [ ] Setup/payoff list indicates which setups carry forward
- [ ] Reader has reason to want next book (question, relationship, mystery)
- [ ] World rules remain consistent
- [ ] Timeline coherent

## Glossary of Key Terms
<!-- METADATA
category: reference
applies_to: documentation
output_format: definitions
-->

**Agency**: Character's ability to make meaningful choices that drive the story forward; active participation rather than passive reaction.

**Arc**: The trajectory of change a character undergoes; can be positive (growth), negative (corruption), or flat (world changes around them).

**Beat**: A specific story moment or turning point; can be emotional beats (shifts in feeling), plot beats (events), or structural beats (key moments like midpoint reversal).

**Callback**: A reference to an earlier story element that gains new significance; rewards reader memory and creates cohesion.

**Consequence Chain**: The causal link where one event (especially protagonist action) creates the conditions for the next event.

**Dark Humor**: Humor derived from grim, morbid, or absurd situations; serves as tonal counterpoint and reveals character psychology. Required minimum: 2-3 moments per story.

**Deep POV**: Point-of-view technique where reader is embedded in character's consciousness; filters all narration through character's perception, thoughts, and emotions.

**Dramatization**: Showing events unfold through action and scene rather than summarizing or explaining; "show don't tell."

**Escalation**: Progressive increase in stakes, danger, or complexity across the narrative; essential for maintaining tension.

**Foreshadowing**: Planting hints or clues about future events; can be true (accurate) or false (red herrings for misdirection).

**GOOT**: Scene structure acronym - Goal, Obstacle, Outcome, Turn. Every scene needs all four elements.

**Handoff**: Elements (questions, relationships, threads) that carry from one installment to the next in a series; creates continuity.

**Interiority**: The internal experience of a character; thoughts, feelings, sensations rendered on the page.

**Irony** (Dramatic): When reader knows something character doesn't; creates tension and engagement.

**Irony** (Situational): When outcome contradicts expectations in meaningful way; often used for character deaths and reversals.

**Motif**: A recurring element (object, image, phrase, symbol) that carries thematic significance; meaning should evolve across story. Must appear in each part.

**Payoff**: The fulfillment or resolution of a setup; creates reader satisfaction when executed well.

**POV** (Point of View): The perspective from which story is told; can be first-person, third-person limited, third-person omniscient, etc.

**Red Herring**: False clue or misleading information designed to misdirect reader; must be plausible to work.

**Resonance**: The sense that ending meaningfully connects to beginning, creating feeling of completion and transformation.

**Reversal**: A major turning point where situation changes significantly; often involves new information or perspective. Required at midpoint (Part 3).

**Setup**: An element planted early that will pay off later; can be object, information, relationship, ability, or pattern.

**Stakes**: What characters stand to gain or lose; can be external (physical), internal (psychological), or thematic (philosophical). Must escalate across parts.

**Subplot**: Secondary plot thread that runs parallel to main plot; should mirror, contrast, complicate, or deepen main themes. Integration score should be 3+ (out of 5).

**Turn**: The change in situation or power dynamic at the end of a scene; prevents status quo endings.

**Voice Drift**: When character's distinctive speech patterns or narrative voice becomes inconsistent; common problem in series.
