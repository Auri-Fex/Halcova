## 2. Core Style Principles

- **Dark Fantasy Voice**: Gritty, atmospheric, and psychologically deep. Blend poetic language with brutal realism and dark humor.
- **Deep POV**: Every scene immerses the reader in the character’s consciousness, filtered through their psychology, senses, and biases.
- **Physical & Sensory Immersion**: Anchor every scene in the physical world and the character’s body. Engage at least three senses per scene, with at least one non-visual.
- **Motif Discipline**: Motifs and symbols must be tracked, developed, and evolve across the narrative. Each motif must appear in every part and crystallize in the closing image.
- **Prose Rhythm & Variation**: Vary sentence length, structure, and openers. Use fragments for emphasis. Avoid repetitive subject-verb patterns.
- **Dark Humor**: Integrate sardonic, gallows, or bitter humor, especially in tense moments. At least 2-3 moments per story.
- **No m-dashes or colons**: Do not use m-dashes (—) or colons (:) anywhere in narrative, dialogue, or description. Use commas, periods, or semicolons for breaks. If you find an m-dash or colon, revise it immediately. This rule is non-negotiable.
- **No generic similes/metaphors**: Avoid “the kind of...”, “the sort of...”, or lazy comparisons. Use setting-appropriate, vivid, and logical figurative language.

## 3. Narrative Structure & Techniques

### POV Approaches

- First-person, third-person limited, omniscient, unreliable, rotating/multi-POV

### Nonlinear Storytelling

- Flashbacks, flashforwards, parallel timelines, fragmented chronology

### Multi-Threaded Plots

- Interwoven arcs, subplots, ensemble casts

### Other Techniques

- Epistolary elements, framing devices, scene cards for tracking

---

## 4. Motifs & Recurring Symbols

1. Review core themes, emotional arcs, and worldbuilding.
2. Brainstorm objects, images, colors, weather, animals, rituals, or phrases as motifs.
3. Assign motifs to characters, POVs, or scenes. Track in scene cards and profiles.
4. Use motifs for foreshadowing, emotional resonance, and thematic depth. Let meaning evolve.
5. Motifs must appear in each part, evolve, and crystallize in the closing image.
6. Track motif appearances and context shifts. Remove underdeveloped motifs.
7. Integrate motifs organically: sensory description, dialogue, character psychology, thematic build.

---

## 5. Prose Style Techniques

### Rhythm & Pacing

- Vary sentence length by POV and emotional state.
- Use paragraph breaks for emphasis. Reserve one-line paragraphs for reveals or reversals.
- Use fragments for effect, especially in dialogue or stream-of-consciousness.

### Punctuation Discipline

- Never use m-dashes (—) or colons (:) in any prose. Replace with commas, periods, or semicolons. This applies to all narrative, dialogue, and description. Review drafts for accidental use and correct before submission.

### Scene Breaks & POV Clarity

- Every scene begins with a one-line diegetic plaque (POV and location, in-world, not HUD/telemetry).
- Consistent formatting for plaques. No out-of-world era labeling.

### Figurative Language

- Use metaphors and similes that are vivid, logical, and grounded in the story’s world and character perspective. Every comparison should deepen immersion, not break it.
- Absolutely avoid generic, modern, or lazy comparisons. Never use phrases like “the kind of...”, “the sort of...”, “like a machine”, “as if on TV”, or any simile/metaphor that would not exist in the setting.
- If a simile or metaphor could fit in any genre or era, replace it with one that is specific to your world’s culture, history, or environment.
- Example (good): “His thoughts scattered like crows startled from a corpse.”
- Example (bad): “Her mind raced like a computer.”
- Example (good): “The promise hung between them, thin as a spider’s thread in a cellar.”
- Example (bad): “He felt a chill, the kind of cold you get in a hospital.”

### Sentence Structure

- Use inversion, parallelism, and varied openers. Let POV profile influence structure.

### Voice & Tone

- Internal monologue, deep POV, sensory immersion, subtext.
- Stream-of-consciousness, repetition, white space for tension.
- Diction and grammar reflect character background and mood.

---

## 6. Physical & Environmental Immersion

### Character Self-Observation

- POV character notices their own clothing, body, and sensations, filtered by psychology and class.
- Integrate into action and sensation, not static blocks.

### Describing Others

- 2-3 specific, POV-filtered details for new characters. Add more as scene progresses.
- Class/status markers, physical tells, filtered by POV bias.

### Setting & Atmosphere

- Anchor every scene in a specific, sensory-rich location.
- Show class, culture, and history through environment.
- Use weather, season, and time of day for mood.

### Description Integration

- Avoid static description blocks. Integrate with action, reaction, and memory.
- Use functional, sensory, and comparative details.

---

## 7. Sensory Immersion

- Engage at least three senses per scene, with at least one non-visual.
- Characters must exist as physical bodies, not floating consciousnesses.
- Settings should have a distinct sensory signature.

---

## 8. Character Arcs & Relationships

- Wide range of journeys: redemption, corruption, self-discovery, sacrifice, revenge, etc.
- Tragic flaws and internal conflicts drive decisions.
- Relationships evolve: alliances, betrayals, mentorships, rivalries, romances.
- Arc progression: setup, inciting incident, rising tension, climax, resolution.
- Arc is visible through POV and worldbuilding.
- Characters must bear the cost of their choices.

---

## 9. Dialogue Craft

- Dialogue reveals character through voice, not just information.
- Differentiate voice by sentence length, vocabulary, speech patterns, and characteristic phrases.
- Class and regional markers audible in speech.
- Dialogue rhythm: pauses, interruptions, unfinished thoughts, action beats, and silence.
- Exposition in dialogue must be broken up with reaction, action, and interruption.

---

## 10. Show vs. Tell for Revelations

- Dramatize major revelations and reversals. Show discovery through action and reaction.
- Never let exposition run longer than 3-4 sentences without POV response.
- Reversals must have a visual/physical component and immediate emotional impact.

---

## 11. Literary Devices & Thematic Depth

- Use metaphor, simile, allusion, symbolism, dramatic irony, existential motifs, and philosophical language.
- Themes: human condition, morality, emotional depth, social commentary, existential questions.
- World-building: immersive, diverse, with magical/technological systems and cultural context.
- Characterization: morally ambiguous, complex, multi-dimensional, with deep motivations and nuanced relationships.

---

## 12. AI Checklist: What Not To Do

- Do not use generic or modern similes/metaphors. Avoid “the kind of...”, “the sort of...”, “like a computer”, “as if on TV”, etc.
- Do not use m-dashes or colons. Use commas, periods, or semicolons instead.
- Do not let dialogue become a transcript. Always include internal reaction, action, or subtext.
- Do not use static description blocks. Integrate description with action and POV.
- Do not let motif appearances drop below three per story part. Remove or develop underused motifs.
- Do not use out-of-world or anachronistic references.
- Do not let three consecutive sentences start with the same structure (e.g., pronoun + verb).
- Do not let exposition run for more than four sentences without interruption.
- Do not use passive, malleable characters. Give every character opinions and agency.
- Do not use only visual sensory detail. Engage at least three senses per scene.
- Do not use dialogue for long, uninterrupted exposition. Break it up with action and reaction.
- Do not use “something” as an emotional descriptor. Be specific.
- Do not use coincidence to resolve conflict. Coincidence may create trouble, not solve it.

## 13. Pre-Drafting Story Rules

Before drafting any story—regardless of length, genre, or medium—use this checklist to ensure your narrative is compelling, focused, and true to the dark fantasy spirit. These rules are designed to challenge both writer and character, and to keep the audience invested from the first word to the last.

1. People admire a character for trying more than for their successes. What will your protagonist strive for, and how will their struggle earn respect?
2. Keep in mind what’s interesting to an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different. What will keep your reader turning pages?
3. Try to write around a theme but know that you won’t see what the story is actually about until you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite. What theme are you circling?
4. Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___. (Complete the story spine for clarity.)
5. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free. What can you cut or merge?
6. Consider what your character is good at and comfortable with and throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal with it?
7. Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Endings are hard, get yours working up front. What is your ending?
8. Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time. Will you finish and move on?
9. Make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next when you're stuck. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up. What’s on your list?
10. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you: recognize it before you can use it. What do you love in your favorite stories?
11. Put it on paper to start fixing it. If a perfect idea stays in your head, you’ll never share it with anyone. Have you started drafting?
12. Discount the first thing that comes to mind. And the second, third, fourth and fifth – get the obvious out of the way. What’s left after the obvious is gone?
13. Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience. Are your characters active and opinionated?
14. Decide why you must tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off? That’s the heart of it. What’s your story’s core belief?
15. Ask how you would feel if you were your character in a situation. Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations. Are you being emotionally honest?
16. Ask what the stakes are. Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed?
17. Don't worry that work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on – it’ll come back around to be useful later. Can you let go of what isn’t working?
18. Know yourself and the difference between doing your best and fussing. Story is testing, not refining. Are you moving forward?
19. Use coincidences to get characters into trouble, but not to get them out of it. That's cheating. Are your plot twists earned?
20. Take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How do you rearrange them into what you DO like? What would you change?
21. Identify with your situation/characters. What would make YOU act that way? Can you empathize with your cast?
22. Know the essence of your story: the most economical telling of it. This will help you build it out. What’s your story’s core in a single sentence?
