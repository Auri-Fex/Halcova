# Technology Overview

> **Quick Summary**: Norbela's technology is powered entirely by shyak (magical oil) extracted from creatures, creating an industrial society where devices are sophisticated but unstable, access correlates with wealth, and every innovation accelerates environmental collapse.

**In this article:**
- Fundamental Principles
- Tech-Magic Relationship
- Technological Capabilities
- Limitations and Boundaries
- Social Impact

## Fundamental Principles

### The Source

**ALL magic comes from creatures (fauna only)**:
- No human innate magic
- No plant magic
- Only animals can metabolize finyak
- Shyak extracted from creature bodies

**Shyak as Fuel**:
- Devices powered by burning/channeling magical oil
- Like gasoline engines (but magical)
- No fuel = no function
- Consumption rate varies by device

### How Devices Work

**Components**:
1. **Shyak Reservoir**: Holds fuel (tank, cartridge, battery)
2. **Arcane Matrix**: Crystalline structure that focuses/directs power
3. **Mechanical Components**: Gears, pistons, conduits (standard engineering)
4. **Control Mechanisms**: Levers, dials, switches

**Not Magical Themselves**:
- Devices are engineered objects
- Made from standard materials (metal, glass, wood, crystal)
- Magic only occurs when shyak is consumed
- No enchantments or inherent power

**Operating Principle**:
- Load shyak into reservoir
- Activate device (trigger matrix)
- Shyak burns/flows through matrix
- Matrix converts to desired effect (heat, light, motion, etc.)
- Byproducts released (entropy, waste heat, residue)

### Instability Rule

**More Complex = More Unstable**:
- Simple devices (lamps, heaters): Reliable
- Medium devices (carriages, firearms): Occasional failures
- Complex devices (automata, airships): High failure rate
- Experimental devices: 50%+ failure rate

**Why**:
- More moving parts = more failure points
- Multiple matrices = interference
- High power = entropy buildup
- Poor engineering = catastrophe

---

## Tech-Magic Relationship

### Entirely Dependent

**No Technology Without Magic**:
- All industry runs on shyak
- All transport powered by shyak
- All advanced capabilities require shyak
- Without creatures: Immediate collapse to pre-industrial

**Historical Development**:
- 1500: Discovery of shyak = tech revolution
- 1600-1700: Proto-industrial (refineries, early engines)
- 1700-1800: Full industrial (factories, rails, telegraph)
- 1800-1900: Mature systems (three-fuel economy)
- 1900+: Terminal decline (extraction exceeds supply)

**See**: [[History 1500-1780]] for tech evolution timeline

### Engineering Discipline

**Artifice**: Field that combines shyak, matrices, mechanics

**Training**:
- 4-8 years study (universities, guilds)
- Mathematics, physics, arcane theory
- Practical engineering
- Safety protocols (often ignored)

**Class System**:
- Master Artificers: Design new devices (elite, well-paid)
- Journeymen: Build/maintain devices (middle class)
- Apprentices: Learn trade (hopeful)
- Factory workers: Operate machines (expendable)

## Technological Capabilities

### What Tech Can Do

**Energy Generation**:
- Heating (arcane furnaces)
- Lighting (arcane lamps, streetlights)
- Cooling (rare, expensive, 10x fuel cost)
- Power for machinery (engines, pumps, mills)
- Efficiency: ~40% (60% lost to waste)

**Communication**:
- Message stones (paired crystals, ~100km range)
- Scrying mirrors (visual, ~50km range, expensive)
- Arcane telegraph (text via network, fixed infrastructure)
- All consume shyak (1-5 liters/hour)

**Transportation**:
- Arcane carriages (30-50 km/h, 200km range)
- Arcane rail (80-100 km/h, long-distance)
- Skyships (40-60 km/h, 50% crash rate, experimental)
- No teleportation, no individual flight, no portals

**Weaponry**:
- Arcane firearms (musket-equivalent, 50-100m range)
- Arcane cannons (artillery, 500-1000m range)
- Arcane blades (enhanced cutting, cauterizes)
- Entropy weapons (banned, used anyway)

**Medicine**:
- Arcane surgery (80% success rate, elite only)
- Regeneration (60% success, 10K-50K GS, barons only)
- Life extension (+20-40 years, 5K-10K GS/year)
- Disease curing (70-90% success, 100-5K GS)

**Industry**:
- Arcane forges, looms, pumps, mills
- 10x productivity vs manual labor
- Replace workers (unemployment crisis)
- Consume 100-500 liters shyak/day (large factories)

**See**: [[Device Catalog]] for complete inventory

## Limitations and Boundaries

### What Tech Cannot Do

**Impossible**:
- Resurrection (dead is dead)
- Teleportation (theory exists, impractical fuel needs)
- Mind control (drugs alter behavior, not true control)
- Weather manipulation (small effects possible, large impossible)
- True prophecy (Vonder-Shin's visions are exception)
- Unlimited power (thermodynamics apply)
- Create magical creatures (can only harvest existing)

**Entropy Cannot Be Reversed**:
- Dead zones permanent
- Once corrupted, stays corrupted
- Second Cascade proved this catastrophically
- All "reversal" attempts make worse

**Conservation of Energy**:
- No perpetual motion
- No free energy
- All power comes from fuel
- Efficiency limited by physics

## Social Impact

### Class Through Access

**Upper Castes** (5% population):
- Pure shyak, high-quality devices
- Life extension, medical care
- Climate-controlled homes
- Personal carriages, communication
- Live 70+ years

**Middle Castes** (35% population):
- Standard shyak, reliable devices
- Some medical access (expensive)
- Public transport, shared communication
- Modest comfort
- Live 50 years

**Lower Castes** (60% population):
- Fauxil/slagcells, unreliable devices
- No medical care (can't afford)
- Walk or cheap public transport
- No communication access
- Live 35 years
- Constant device failures, injuries, deaths

### Technology-Driven Inequality

**Access = Life Quality**:
- Better fuel = longer life
- Better devices = more comfort
- Better medicine = survival
- No access = death

**Employment**:
- Automation replaces workers: 20% unemployment
- Remaining jobs dangerous (device operation)
- Injuries and mutations common
- Fired when no longer productive

### Environmental Destruction

**Extraction Enables Overuse**:
- Technology makes harvesting efficient
- Over-extraction depletes populations
- Faster than before industrial era
- No equilibrium possible at current scale

**Pollution**:
- Refineries dump corrupted waste
- Poor neighborhoods poisoned
- Cancer rates 300% higher near refineries
- Authorities ignore (poor can't pay for cleanup)

**Dead Zone Expansion**:
- Technology accelerates entropy spread
- Device failures release entropy
- Waste accumulates
- 10%/year growth rate

## Current State (1900)

### Mature But Dying

**Infrastructure Established**:
- Five major rail lines
- Telegraph network (limited)
- Urban arcane grids
- Factory systems

**But Declining**:
- Fuel scarcity increasing
- Failures more frequent
- Maintenance deferred
- Quality dropping

### Forbidden Technologies

**Officially Banned**:
- Entropy weapons (too dangerous)
- Soul transfer (abominations)
- Necromancy (war crime)
- Corruption induction (creates monsters)
- Mass extraction (instant dead zones)

**Reality**:
- Nethvor produces all of above
- Desperate barons buy
- Koresh-Val experiments openly
- Meshira-Tal seeking superweapon
- Council can't enforce bans

**See**: [[Forbidden Technology]] for details

## Innovation vs Desperation

### Cutting-Edge Research

**Telvor-Shin's Projects**:
- Arcane automata (60% failure rate)
- Entropy reversal (theory only, dangerous)
- Shyak synthesis (0% success, impossible)
- Skyship armada (7 of 10 crashed)

**Motivation**: Reckless optimism, refusal to accept limits

### Black Market Tech

**Nethvor's Innovations**:
- Entropy grenades (functional, deadly)
- Counterfeit shyak (30% of market, causes failures)
- Slave control collars (illegal, common)
- Surveillance bypass (Nethvor monopoly)

**Motivation**: Profit, power, no ethics

### The Problem

**Every Innovation**:
- Requires more shyak
- Accelerates depletion
- Creates new hazards
- Doesn't solve root cause

**Conclusion**: Technology created the crisis; technology cannot solve it

## In the World

### Daily Reliance

**Upper Castes**:
- Arcane everything (lighting, heating, transport, communication)
- Take for granted
- Can't imagine life without

**Middle Castes**:
- Some arcane devices (public transport, workplace)
- Stretch budgets to afford
- Fear losing access

**Lower Castes**:
- Minimal exposure (work in factories, ride cheap rail)
- Suffer from byproducts (pollution, accidents)
- No benefits, all costs

### Cultural Attitudes

**Optimists**: "Technology will save us" (wrong)
**Pragmatists**: "Use what works, ignore rest" (common)
**Pessimists**: "Technology doomed us" (correct)
**Radicals**: "Destroy all devices, return to nature" (Morshan-Breakers)

## Story Integration

### Plot Hooks

1. **Device Breakthrough**: New invention promises solution; too good to be true
2. **Catastrophic Failure**: Major device explodes; cover-up or accountability?
3. **Black Market Deal**: Acquire illegal tech; moral compromise
4. **Tech Dependency**: Device breaks, can't survive without it; find replacement
5. **Industrial Sabotage**: Morshan-Breakers targeting factories; join or stop?
6. **Ancient Device**: Discover superior pre-collapse tech; understand or destroy?
7. **Automated Uprising**: Automata go rogue; stop before massacre
8. **Fuel Shortage**: Shyak runs out; improvise or die

### Themes
