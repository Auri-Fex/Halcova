| Caste | % Pop | Life Exp | Shyak Access | Daily Reality |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Shyakor** (Elite) | 1% | 80-100y | Unlimited | Decadent luxury, immunity from law |

| **Telkorin** (Workers) | 25% | 45-50y | Minimal rations | Perpetual debt, grinding poverty |
| **Korbal** (Laborers) | 35% | 35-40y | None | Expendable, brutal work, no protections |
| **Drenkor** (Indentured) | 15% | 25-35y | None | Legal property, generational servitude |
| **Finyakor** (Outcasts) | 10% | 15-25y | None | Can be killed, many mutated |

### 3. **Daily Life Documented**
