# Travel and Infrastructure

> **Quick Summary**: Travel on Norbela is dangerous, expensive, and often fatal, with arcane rail limited to Tavanor, roads plagued by bandits, and most routes requiring dangerous detours around expanding dead zones.

---

## Transportation Methods

### Arcane Rail

**Coverage**: 5 major lines from Kalen-Sheloth hub
**Speed**: 80-100 km/h
**Cost**: 10-50 GS per 100km (class-based)
**Range**: Tavanor and eastern Sulenor only

**Routes**:
1. Kalen-Sheloth → Vorn-Merath (600km, 6 hours when running)
2. Kalen-Sheloth → Telian-Kresh (400km, 4 hours)
3. Kalen-Sheloth → Gen-Sorath (300km, 3 hours)
4. Kalen-Sheloth → Crystal Caverns (200km, 2 hours)
5. Partial line toward Dresh-Kalmor (incomplete, dangerous)

**Issues**:
- Frequent breakdowns
- Fuel shortages
- Sabotage (Morshan-Breakers)
- Delays common (expect 2x travel time)
- Winter: 50% cancellations

### Arcane Carriages

**Speed**: 30-50 km/h (terrain-dependent)
**Range**: 200km per fuel tank
**Cost**: 500-1,000 GS per 100km
**Availability**: Middle class and above

**Advantages**:
- Flexible routing
- Faster than foot/horse
- Climate-controlled (when working)

**Disadvantages**:
- Expensive
- Device failures (10% per 200km)
- Bandit targets
- Fuel scarcity

### Horse and Foot

**Speed**: 
- Horse: 40-50 km/day
- Foot: 25-30 km/day

**Cost**: Minimal (food, shelter, guards)
**Availability**: All classes

**Risks**:
- Exposure (freezing, heat)
- Creature attacks
- Bandits
- Exhaustion
- Slow (vulnerable)

### Experimental Skyships

**Speed**: 40-60 km/h
**Cost**: 10,000+ GS per trip
**Availability**: Military and desperate only
**Failure Rate**: **50%** (crashes kill all)

**Uses**:
- Emergency evacuations
- Military operations
- Wealthy escape (sometimes)
- Suicide missions (often)

## Major Routes

### The Crystal Road (Tavanor-Sulenor)

**Distance**: 600km
**Travel Times**:
- Rail: 6 hours (when running, often 12)
- Carriage: 3 days
- Foot: 12 days

**Dangers**:
- Bandits (frequent)
- Device failures
- Border checkpoints (bribes required)
- Weather (blizzards winter, ash summer)

### The Northern Way (Tavanor-Vashor)

**Distance**: 1,500km
**Travel Times**:
- No rail
- Carriage: 8 days (summer only)
- Foot: 20 days (summer only)

**Seasonal**:
- Winter: Impassable (6 months)
- Summer: Barely passable
- Spring/Autumn: Dangerous

**Dangers**:
- Blizzards (death in hours)
- Ice-creatures
- Isolation (no help)
- Freezing equipment

### The Dead Route (Tavanor-Konor)

**Distance**: 1,200km (detours add 5-10 days)
**Travel Times**:
- Carriage: 12 days minimum
- Foot: 18+ days

**Must Avoid**: Central Tavanor dead zone (500,000 km² instant death)

**Dangers**:
- Entropy storms
- Corrupted creatures
- Desperate refugees (violence)
- Dead zone expansion (routes change overnight)

### The Forest Path (Tavanor-Eshtor)

**Distance**: Variable (depends on Vornalen-Keeper activity)
**Travel Times**:
- Carriage: 8 days (if allowed through)
- Foot: 15 days (high fatality)

**Dangers**:
- Vornalen-Keepers (kill outsiders, 200+ deaths/year)
- Extraction Wars (frontline)
- Guerrilla ambushes
- Getting lost (forest vast, fatal)

## Travel Hazards (Annual Statistics)

**By Cause**:
- Bandit attacks: 500-1,000 deaths
- Creature encounters: 300-800 deaths
- Freezing (Vashor routes): 100-500 deaths
- Volcanic (Sulenor routes): 500-2,000 deaths
- Vornalen-Keepers (Eshtor): 200+ deaths
- Entropy (Konor, expanding): 1,000+ deaths
- Disease (Eshtor swamps): 400+ deaths
- Device failures (all routes): 300+ deaths

**By Route Type**:
- Bandit frequency: 1 attack per 100km (trade routes)
- Creature frequency: 1 encounter per 50km (near dead zones)
- Device failure: 10% chance per 200km traveled
- Weather disasters: Seasonal (varies)

**Survival Tips**:
- Travel in armed convoys
- Hire local guides (expensive but necessary)
- Avoid winter travel (north)
- Avoid dead zone borders
- Pay bribes (cheaper than fighting)
- Expect delays
- Pack double supplies

## Infrastructure Condition

**Roads**:
- Maintained in Tavanor (good condition)
- Neglected in Sulenor (industrial zones only)
- Minimal in Eshtor (forest paths)
- Nonexistent in Vashor (ice trails)
- Destroyed in Konor (entropy)

**Bridges**:
- Arcane suspension bridges (Tavanor)
- Rope bridges (Eshtor)
- Ice bridges (Vashor, unstable)
- Collapsed or nonexistent (Konor)

**Waystations**:
- Fortified inns (Tavanor, every 50km)
- Scattered (Sulenor, Eshtor)
- Rare (Vashor)
- None (Konor)

## Communication

**Arcane Message Stones** (Elite):
- Instant communication
- Expensive (50+ GS per message)
- Limited range (500km)
- Requires paired stones

**Courier Services**:
- Horse/carriage delivery
- 5-20 days delivery
- 10-50 GS per message
- High failure rate

**Rail Post**:
- Fastest (when running)
- Tavanor/Sulenor only
- 1-3 days delivery
- Cheap (1-5 GS)

**No Communication**:
- Most settlements isolated
- News travels slowly
- Disasters unknown for weeks
- Strategic disadvantage

---

## Future Collapse

**As Dead Zones Expand**:
- Routes cut off
- Regions isolated
- Trade impossible
- Civilization fragments
- Communication fails

**Timeline**:
- Current: Difficult but possible
- 5 years: Major routes cut
- 10 years: Regions isolated
- 15 years: Travel impossible
