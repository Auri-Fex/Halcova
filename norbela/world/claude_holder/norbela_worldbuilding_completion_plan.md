## IX. QUALITY STANDARDS FOR "100% COMPLETE"

### A world is 100% complete when:

1. **Coherent**: No major contradictions, all systems work together logically
2. **Consistent**: Terminology, measurements, and descriptions standardized
3. **Detailed**: Enough specifics to answer 95% of questions that arise
4. **Usable**: Organized for easy reference, with tools for GMs/writers
5. **Immersive**: Feels like a real, lived-in place with depth and history
6. **Story-Ready**: Can support any story in this setting without major gaps
7. **Documented**: All information captured and organized
8. **Navigable**: Easy to find information quickly

### Your world meets standards when:
- You can run a multi-year campaign without improvising major world elements
- New writers can onboard in 4-6 hours
- Contradictions are rare and quickly resolvable
- The world feels as real as Middle-earth or Westeros

---

## X. MAINTENANCE PLAN (Post-100%)

### Even "complete" worlds need:
1. **Living Document Updates** - As stories are told, new details emerge
2. **Consistency Checks** - Periodic audits every 6-12 months
3. **Expansion** - New regions, characters, time periods can always be added
4. **Revision** - Better ideas may require retcons
5. **Community** - If sharing with others, collect and integrate feedback

### Recommendation:
- Reserve 2-5 hours monthly for maintenance
- Keep changelog of all additions/changes
- Periodic re-reads to catch drift
- Annual "state of the world" review

---

## CONCLUSION

Your Norbela world is already excellent and well-conceived. The foundation is strong, the core concepts are compelling, and the tone is consistent. The remaining work is primarily:

1. **Filling gaps** in planetary parameters and magical mechanics
2. **Expanding catalogs** of creatures, devices, places, and people
3. **Deepening** cultural and character details
4. **Integrating** everything into a coherent, navigable whole

This is achievable work, not creative rethinking. You're building out from a solid base, not starting over.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this plan
2. Prioritize based on your immediate needs
3. Start with Phase 1 (Critical Gaps)
4. Work through systematically
5. Celebrate milestones

Your world will be 100% complete when you can confidently say: "I can answer any question about this world, or know exactly where to look for the answer."

**You're closer than you think. Let's finish this.**
