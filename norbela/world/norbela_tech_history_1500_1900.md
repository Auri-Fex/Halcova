# Norbela: Magitech Evolution Timeline (1500–1900)

## 1500–1540 — Discovery & Alchemical Sail

**Tech baseline:** Late medieval / early Age of Sail. Caravels and cogs. Muscle, wind, water. Early bombards and hand-gonnes, unreliable.

**The break:**
- Explorers in harsh, creature-rich regions (aurora coasts, ice-choked seas, weird estuaries) discover:
  - Some creatures bleed or secrete **oils and tissues that behave like concentrated, semi-stable magic**.
  - They burn hotter, cling to metal, resist frost, sometimes mend flesh or twist it.

**Immediate usage:**
- This is framed as **miracle, not industry**:
  - Temples and cathedrals hoard “saint-lamps” that never seem to go out.
  - Nobles commission **healing baths, salves, and amulets**.
  - A few mad tinkers strap crude pistons, bellows, or winches to the stuff, often with catastrophic failure.

**Exploration:**
- Still classic sail power — no engines yet. But:
  - Ships carrying arcane lamps can push into **longer nights, heavier fog, nastier ice**.
  - Captains quietly test “witch oil” on hulls and rigging (frost-shedding coatings, hardened spars).

The world at this point: **late medieval with alchemical cheat codes** in a few rich and lucky hands.

## 1540–1600 — Arcane Age of Discovery & Conquest

**Scaling the miracle:**
- Hunters and sailors start targeting **specific creature grounds**.
- Crude **grading** appears:
  - “Lamp oil” vs “medicinal” vs “engine-worthy” (even before proper engines exist).
- Early port-refineries:
  - Boil, strain, and separate the gunk into more predictable fractions.

**Exploration becomes bio-cartography:**
- The Age of Discovery shifts from “Where are the continents?” to:
  - “Where do these **beasts spawn, migrate, and die**?”
- Charts record:
  - Currents and winds **and** creature habitats and aurora intensity.
- Crown- and guild-chartered companies form, with rights to:
  - **“Harvest all witch-beasts”** in a bay, strait, or stretch of coast.
  - These are proto–East India Companies, but for **biological magic stock**.

**Military & port infrastructure:**
- Ports adopt:
  - Arcane **bilge pumps**, **capstans**, and **dock cranes**; still one-off artisanal devices.
- Navies and pirates:
  - Experiment with **oil-treated hulls**, slightly tougher or more slippery in ice and surf.
  - Limited use of explosive or incendiary oils in boarding and sieges.

Still no “industrial revolution,” but by 1600, any serious power knows:
**“Global power = who controls the magical creature grounds.”**

## 1600–1650 — Mercantile Arcane & Proto-Industrialization

**The energy pivot:**
- Leading states now have:
  - Regular supply of several key **creature products**, not just curiosities.
  - Dedicated **port refineries**.
  - The first clumsy attempts at **non-lethal extraction** and semi-managed breeding grounds.
- Waste from refineries piles up: sludge, blood, bone, residue.

**Alt-fuel birth:**
- Tinkerers start compressing sludge + plant matter + ash into **fauxil bricks**:
  - Dirty, weaker than true oil, but cheap and scalable.
- Low-grade Residue is bottled and wired into **early slagcells**:
  - Single-use magi-batteries for lamps, triggers, and toys.

**Proto-industry:**
- Some mills and mines become **hybrid systems**:
  - Waterwheel for baseline power.
  - Arcane engines for **startup torque, heavy lifting, and peak loads**.
- Line-work:
  - Primitive **automata** and golems handle repetitive tasks: hammering, gate-lifting, bellows-pumping.
  - Half of them are OSHA violations with legs.

**Urban shift:**
- Rich districts:
  - **Arcane streetlamps**, reliable clinic-rigs, miracle surgeries for the elite.
- Poor districts:
  - Lanterns on cheap fauxil, occasional glitch devices, wild black-market rigs.

**Exploration moves inland & extreme:**
- Coasts and obvious routes: mostly known.
- New targets:
  - **Subglacial rivers**, interior frozen basins, canyon biomes, upland aurora bands.
- Expeditions:
  - **Sled caravans** with arcane heaters and beacon pylons.
  - Hazardous submersibles to sample deep creature swarms.

This is your **early Industrial Revolution analogue**, shifted up a century: factories exist, but the engine in the basement is a snarling magical biology problem.

---

## 1650–1700 — Clockwork Baroque (Early Arcane Industrial)

**Industrial maturity (v1):**
- **Sled-rail / proto-rail networks**:
  - Sled trains on fixed routes through snow and ice, powered by a mix of engines and fauxil.
- **Arcane icebreakers and hybrid ships**:
  - Iron-reinforced hulls, engines assisting sail to punch through seasonal ice and bad weather.
- **Factory belts**:
  - Textile, armament, shipbuilding districts powered by standardized arcane engines.
  - Better automata (crane-walkers, track-runners) moving goods and ore.

**Communications:**
- Arcane **telegraph-like networks**:
  - Residue-stable channels along roads and rails.
  - Beacon towers for ship-to-shore optical/arcane signaling.

**Daily life:**
- Elite:
  - Heated homes, reliable lighting, controlled climate in limited zones.
  - Medical arcane tech: healing tanks, prosthetics with known patterns of cost (Residue load, mild mutation, shortened lifespan).
- Underclass:
  - Live in the exhaust: fauxil smoke, slag-run devices, frequent malfunctions.
  - Cheap knockoff engines and bonewire networks with low-grade Residue.

**Ecological and metaphysical hit:**
- Multiple **keystone species** are hit hard near ports and industrial centers.
- **Residue** accumulates:
  - Glitchy zones where devices misfire, illusions persist, or local physics gets “grabby.”
- States respond with:
  - Early **Conservation Edicts** (breeding reserves, seasonal bans).
  - **Hunting quotas** and granted monopolies to “responsible” charter companies.

By 1700, Norbela has **industrialized early** and already hit its first major resource and pollution limits.

## 1700–1750 — Arcane Plateau & First Crash

**Overreach arrives:**
- Long-term overharvest means:
  - Some species **collapse regionally**, others shift migration patterns unpredictably.
- Residue levels hit the “you can’t ignore this anymore” line:
  - Cities suffer **Residue storms**:
    - Widespread device failure.
    - Short-lived reality distortions.
    - Spikes in mental illness, birth defects, and “haunted” districts.

**Economic shock:**
- Factories in affected regions:
  - Lose reliable fuels and safe operating conditions.
  - Some urban belts **rust out** or have to shut down parts of the arcane grid.
- Power blocs split:
  1. **Maximalists** – push further out, invade new biomes, burn harder.
  2. **Retrenchers** – ration oil, fall back to wind/water/fauxil for broad use.
  3. **Alt-fuel evangelists** – push slagcells, fauxil, bonewire as primary tech.

**Sail’s temporary comeback:**
- Arcane engines become **expensive and fragile**.
- Sail, with minimal arcane augmentation, regains value:
  - Wind doesn’t glitch in Residue storms.
  - Low-arcana ships can move through contaminated routes where engines fail.

This is the **first arcane depression**: not a total collapse, but a nasty correction that forces the world to rethink “infinite magic forever.”

## 1750–1830 — Conservation Compacts & Alt-Fuel Revolution

**The compromise:**
All the powers that want to stay powers converge on the same grim insight:
> “We treat prime creature-oil like enriched uranium. Everything else runs on trash and cleverness.”

**Creature management:**
- **Breeding reserves & farms**:
  - Islands, tunnels, floating pens, purpose-built tundra corridors.
  - Emerging field of **arcane biology**: selective breeding for higher yield, calmer temperament, faster regeneration.
- International / inter-regional **Compacts**:
  - Carve up **species and habitats** into spheres of influence.
  - At least on paper, limit culls and allow recovery windows.

**Alt-fuel scaling:**
- **Fauxil**:
  - Standardized bricks and liquids from plants, bones, sludge.
  - Fuels domestic heat, low-end engines, and frontier tech.
- **Slagcells**:
  - Industrial-scale production of magical batteries, supplying:
    - Street lighting, streetcars, hand-tools, minor engines.
- **Bonewire & gutter-tech**:
  - Cheap, Residue-laced networks in poor/far districts.
  - Unstable, glitch-prone, but better than nothing.

**Infrastructure rebuild:**
- Cities retrofit:
  - **Residue scrubbers, sink towers, and piping** to channel runoff.
  - Magic zoning: heavy-engine districts vs “clean” quarters.
- Factories:
  - Reengineer to **mixed stacks**:
    - Prime oil only at key nodes.
    - Fauxil and slagcells for the rest.

**Exploration phase II:**
- Most coastlines/routes are known. New frontiers:
  - Deep subglacial seas, tectonic rifts, sky-bands of weird weather and creatures.
- Expeditions use:
  - Hybrid **sled-rail caravans**, semi-autonomous rigs, early pressure-suits and deep-divers.

By ~1830, the world has re-stabilized on a **tri-fuel footing**: Prime oil (rare), engineered Residue (dirty but potent), and fauxil/sludge (mass, cheap).

## 1830–1900 — Residual Modernity

Now you get the **“magical late-Victorian”** vibe, but the grid runs on residue and salvaged ecology.

### Energy & urban structure
- **Three-layer energy regime fully mature**:
  1. **Prime oil** – strictly rationed; hospitals, high-end engines, strategic weapons, precision systems.
  2. **Engineered Residue** – captured and circulated through towers, pipes, sinks; powers heavy industry, transit, grids.
  3. **Fauxil / slagcells / plant-based** – for domestic life, underclass neighborhoods, frontier.
- Cities by 1900:
  - Dense **Residue-plumbing** (towers, ducts, sink basins).
  - **Arcane streetcars, lifts, conveyor systems** driven by slagcell banks and Residue taps.
  - Wealth gradients map almost 1:1 to:
    - **Proximity to prime-oil lines**.
    - Distance from the dirtiest Residue circuits.

### Travel & exploration
- Seas:
  - Dominated by **arcane industrial fleets**:
    - Steel hulled ships, hybrid engines, layered Residue shielding.
  - Sail is relegated to:
    - Low-cost shipping, fishing, smuggling, and states that opted out of heavy magic.
- Land:
  - Broad **sled-rail and tram networks** link cities and mines.
- Air:
  - Mature **airships** ply high-altitude lanes where Residue is minimal and weather is studied.
  - Critical routes: high-speed passenger and post, reconnaissance, small high-value cargo.
- Exploration is now more **scientific and vertical** than geographic:
  - Deep-bore projects into under-ice seas.
  - Sky expeditions mapping upper-atmosphere creature bands and Residue cycles.

### Communications & proto-computation
- Near-global **arcane telegraph/teletype**:
  - Residue-stable lines and protected waystations.
- Early **“thinking engines”**:
  - Mechanical-arcane arrays that crunch trade/war data in dedicated buildings.
  - Some use bound, specialized creatures as logic nodes.
  - It’s Babbage plus demonology, not laptops.

### Medicine and bodies
- Routine:
  - Infection management, trauma stabilization, high-survival surgery.
  - Regenerative treatments for limbs/organs with predictable side-effects.
- Elite:
  - **Life extension protocols**, extensive grafts, and enhancements—always tied to increased Residue load and risk.
- You get **bio-classes**:
  - Clean-born / minimally modified.
  - Industrial-modified workers and soldiers.
  - Residue-marked, visibly altered populations, stigmatized but indispensable.

### Warfare & geopolitics
- Warfare:
  - Arcane artillery, fortified Residue reactors, airship bombers, rapid troop movements via sled-rail.
  - Strategic value = **breeding reserves, Residue sinks, fauxil supply, and grid nodes**.
- Politics fractures along energy strategies:
  - Prime-oil empires vs Residue-tech states vs low-magic “holdouts” who deliberately underdevelop arcane infrastructure to avoid dependence.

By 1900, Norbela is:
- Industrial, urban, stratified.
- Wired with **magical hazardous-waste infrastructure** instead of electricity.
- Living in the long shadow of 400 years of eating power out of living creatures and trying to bottle the fallout.

## Compressed Timeline Snapshot (1500–1900)

- **1500–1540** – *Discovery*: Miracle creature byproducts; alchemy, temples, nobles. Age of Sail with weird lamps.
- **1540–1600** – *Arcane Discovery*: Charter companies for beast-harvest; ports and navies adopt arcane tools. Exploration = mapping creature biomes.
- **1600–1650** – *Proto-Industrial*: Refineries, early engines, automata, arcane-lit cities. Alt-fuels (fauxil, slagcells) appear.
- **1650–1700** – *Clockwork Baroque*: Sled-rails, icebreakers, factory belts, telegraph-like networks. Conservation and Residue problems emerge hard.
- **1700–1750** – *Crash*: Over-harvest + Residue storms; industrial belts falter; sail has a brief renaissance; ideological split on how to proceed.
- **1750–1830** – *Compacts & Alt-Fuel*: Creature breeding programs, international quotas, huge fauxil and slagcell sectors; cities retrofit for Residue handling.
- **1830–1900** – *Residual Modernity*: Late-Victorian arcane punk; tri-fuel regime; Residue grids; arcane rail, airships, telegraph, proto-computers, body-mod medicine, and permanent ecological debt.

From here your next “era” choice is the fun fork: do they double down on Residue, turn to Aetherite directly, or try to build a post-magic civilization on top of all this mess?
