# Universal Human 5-Name Charter for Norbela

## Default 5-name sequence

1. **Birth Name**
2. **Chosen Section**
3. **Line Acquisition Prefix**
4. **Line Stem**
5. **Fate Name**

---

### 1) Birth Name
A primary personal identifier assigned at birth (or discovery, for foundlings). This name is culturally “straightforward” and typically stable, though some cultures may permit changes after major life events.

---

### 2) Chosen Section
This slot represents a socially acknowledged self-identifier that can emerge later in life.

#### Options for how this works in Norbela
* **Chosen Name**: selected by the person at maturity, after a rite, or after a milestone.
* **Middle Name (optional)**: a secondary personal name that may be:
  * self-selected,
  * bestowed by family/community,
  * assigned by institution (school, temple, state),
  * ceremonial only,
  * or used as the *only* “later-life” name in cultures where people do not pick names.
* **World variant:** a culture may *forbid* self-chosen names but *allow* assigned middle names (or multiple middle names), which still live in this same slot.

#### Invariant rule
The Chosen Section can contain:
* just a chosen name,
* just a middle name,
* or both (culture-dependent),
  but it always functions as the “later identity layer” separate from lineage and fate.

---

### 3–4) Line Name Unit (hyphenated)
This is always written and treated as a single hyphenated unit, composed of two truths:
* **(3) Acquisition Prefix** = *how the person holds the line*
* **(4) Line Stem** = *which line they hold*

#### Core invariants
* The **Line Stem** is the “surname-ish” identity anchor (family/house/clan/branch), regardless of genre or setting.
* The **Acquisition Prefix** is a **closed semantic category** (the same meanings across all cultures; only the sound/orthography changes).
* A person has **one active acquisition prefix** at a time in daily use (histories can be recorded elsewhere, but speech stays readable).

---

### 3) Line Acquisition Prefix categories
Choose a stable set and keep the meaning constant across all cultures. Cultures differ in which they recognize, which are stigmatized, and what rights they grant.

#### A) Standard acquisition (full belonging pathways)
* **Born-of**: default biological claim
* **Recognized**: claim granted or confirmed later (legitimation/acknowledgement/restoration)
* **Taken-in**: adoption / full transfer into the line
* **Married-into**: affinal claim via marriage (temporary or permanent by culture)

#### B) Non-transfer upbringing (connection without full transfer)
* **Fostered-by**: raised by the line, without automatic full standing

#### C) Institutional replacement (line held by oath or role)
* **Sworn-to**: oath-family, order-line, priesthood-line, military-line, etc. (may replace or override birth-line publicly)

#### D) Contested claim (line used without full recognition)
* **Natural-of**: blood connection without formal standing (useful for bastardy/illegitimacy models)
* **Claimed-of**: self-asserted claim without verification
* **Rumored-of**: socially attributed claim the person does not assert as fact
* **Unknown**: records missing/erased; placeholder until resolved

#### E) Severed standing (acknowledged connection, rights denied or surrendered)
* **Exiled-from**: expelled by the line; connection acknowledged, rights stripped
* **Disowned-of**: publicly revoked claim; harsher social/legal weight
* **Renounced-of**: voluntarily surrendered rights while retaining historical connection

---

### Prefix change rules (portable, setting-agnostic)
Prefixes only change at defined life-events (legal, ritual, social, or institutional). Recommended universal event types:
* **Recognition event**: moves a person from contested/limited standing to recognized standing
* **Adoption/transfer event**: changes the pathway by which the line is held
* **Oath event**: institutional line replaces or supersedes other claims (publicly or entirely)
* **Marriage event**: affinal line becomes primary (if that culture uses it)
* **Severance event**: exile, disownment, or renunciation converts the prefix to a severed category
* **Restoration event**: a severed prefix returns to recognized standing

Invariant: changes are **not casual**; they require a culturally legible trigger.

---

### 4) Line Stem
The stable identifier of the line itself.

#### What a Line Stem can represent (world-flexible)
* family/house/clan identity
* root-ancestor identity
* branch/household identity
* place-founded identity
* trade/totem/mythic origin identity
* legal inheritance identity

Invariant: whatever its origin, the stem remains the “which line” anchor, distinct from the acquisition prefix.

---

### 5) Fate Name
A universally present, non-surname identity layer that expresses what the person *carries* (burden, role, omen, calling, prophecy-slot, etc.).

#### Fate invariants
* Everyone has one, even if it is euphemized, sealed, dormant, or private.
* Fate always has:
  * a **Source** (where it comes from: family mantle, omen system, institutional bestowal, prophecy, consequence, etc.)
  * a **Bind** (what it demands: obligation, constraint, role, pull, risk, or cost)
* Fate does **not** change casually; it can activate, clarify, compound, be fulfilled, or be broken—each requiring defined triggers.

#### Fate category options (keep meanings stable; swap aesthetics per world)
* **Mantle** (carried role that can repeat across generations)
* **Debt** (owed burden or inherited obligation)
* **Oath** (binding vow or geas-like constraint)
* **Mark** (omen/scar/signifier of circumstance)
* **Calling** (directional pull toward a path)
* **Curse/Blessing** (imposed fortune or condition)
* **Key** (prophecy-slot / problem-solver designation)

#### Fate–Line interaction rule (recommended invariant)
Whether a person can inherit or publicly claim a family Fate Mantle can depend on their **acquisition prefix category** (full, limited, contested, severed), allowing consistent tension across cultures without changing the name structure.
