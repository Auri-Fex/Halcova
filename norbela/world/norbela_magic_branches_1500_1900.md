# Norbela: Magic Branches & Evolution (1500–1900)

---

## 1. Ecosystem Magic — “Magic is a Biome, Not a Spell”

### Core idea
Magic starts as “Creature X’s oil” and becomes an understanding that **each biome has its own arcane profile**: a roster of creatures, byproducts, and typical effects.

### Evolution over time

**1500–1550 — Single-species awe**
- Creature X is miracle-beast.
- Anyone who’s sailed far enough starts reporting:
  - “There are other things out there, not just X, and they each do different weirdness.”
- Still treated as *individual anomalies*, not a system.

**1550–1650 — Catalogues & bestiaries**
- Naturalists, sailors, and butchers start keeping **systematic logs**:
  - Organize creatures by **habitat** (polar, pelagic, estuarine, abyssal, tundra).
  - Note **effects** of oils/glands: thermal, regenerative, sensory, structural, mental, etc.
- You get the first **Arcane Bestiary Codex** equivalents, with crude “schools”:
  - “Ice-bloods,” “Lumen-backs,” “Echo-flesh,” “Rot-vessels,” etc.
- Trade shifts:
  - Not just “ship meat + oil home” but “target specific high-yield species in specific zones.”

**1650–1750 — Biome schools & regional styles**
- Practitioners specialize by **biome**:
  - Polar school: heat, cold resistance, clarity, endurance.
  - Deep-sea school: pressure, darkness, sound, secrecy.
  - Marsh school: decay, filtration, slow regeneration, toxins.
- Each major power leans on its **home biomes**:
  - Empire A has polar/aurora magic baked into its identity.
  - Empire B is marsh/estuary; its magic feels fungal, slow, corrosive.

**1750–1900 — Arcane ecology**
- Full recognition that:
  - Creatures → byproducts → device/ritual profile.
  - Remove part of the food web and other species shift their outputs.
- Magic theory includes:
  - **Trophic chains of magic**: predators concentrate certain effects; prey bodies carry others.
  - “Keystone creatures” whose removal collapses entire effect ecosystems.
- By 1900:
  - You can literally major in **“Arctic Lumen Ecology”** vs **“Residue-Adapted Marsh Systems.”**
  - Military and industrial planners think in **overlapping magic-biome maps**, like resource + weather + spell meta.

**Result:** Magic is never just “fireball vs shield.” It’s “what does this coastline *do* magically if we stress it?”

## 8. Co-evolution — “The Resource Fights Back”

### Core idea
Four centuries of harvesting is a selective pressure. Creatures **evolve in response** to being turned into fuel.

### Evolution over time

**1500–1600 — Dumb abundance**
- Humans kill whatever they find.
- Creatures are naive; their magic evolved for **climate, predation, mating**, not for “engine extraction.”

**1600–1700 — First responses**
- High pressure on Creature X lineages:
  - Smaller, earlier-breeding variants survive.
  - Migratory timings shift to dodge ships and busy harbors.
- Some creature byproducts become **touchier**:
  - Oils that destabilize faster **once removed** from the body.
  - Glands that react badly to crude cutting, rewarding more careful handling.

**1700–1800 — Divergence: tame vs feral**
Human intervention + natural selection splits species into three rough tracks:
1. **Domesticated strains**
   - Bred in pens, reserves, controlled bays.
   - Traits:
     - Docility, higher gland yield, lower roaming range.
     - Byproducts tuned for specific uses: “lamp-grade” vs “engine-grade” lines.
2. **Wild-adapted strains**
   - Have survived aggressive hunting.
   - Traits:
     - Better camouflage, erratic migrations, defensive discharges on injury.
     - Oils that **curse or contaminate mishandlers** (latent Residue spikes, psychological backlash).
3. **Feral hyper-specialists**
   - Nasty apex or pest variants:
     - Explosive glands.
     - Sudden mutation waves.
     - Symbiosis with Residue-heavy environments.

**1800–1900 — Arms race & creature tech**
- Farms breed **industrial breeds**:
  - “Short-horn heaters,” “long-fin stabilizers,” etc., each with known outputs.
- Wild zones become **arcane hazard categories**:
  - Region X’s “ferals” have oils that corrupt refinery infrastructure.
  - Region Y’s creatures are low-yield but sabotaging (they destabilize Residue grids).
- Whole professions exist:
  - **Bloodline stewards** tuning domestic stock.
  - **Ferality hunters** tracking runaway strains.
  - **Cross-breeders** trying to graft wild defenses into farmable bodies.

**Result:** The magic resource isn’t static; its **profile in 1900 is biologically different** than in 1500, meaning old recipes and spells literally stop working.

## 9. Synthetic Magic — “Build It Instead of Butchering It”

### Core idea
Over time, people try to **recreate creature effects without the creature.**

### Evolution over time

**1600s — Fauxil 1.0: dirty mimicry**
- Early fauxils and slag mixtures:
  - Crude attempts to get “some magical behavior” by cooking residue, plant resins, ash, and trace oil.
  - Works, but narrow and unreliable; mostly for heat and light.

**1700–1800 — Semi-synthetic fuels**
- Industrial labs and refinery offshoots:
  - Identify **key components** in creature oils: rare salts, long-chain arcane “molecules,” trace minerals.
- They learn to:
  - Spike fauxil with **small amounts of prime oil** and catalysts to imitate certain effects.
- “Semi-synthetics” power:
  - Street lighting, low-end engines, basic devices in poor districts.

**1800–1850 — True synthetic attempts**
- Someone finally cracks a process that:
  - Requires **zero new creature tissue**…
  - But demands rare catalysts, specific Residue conditions, and careful timing.
- Early synthetic fuels:
  - Less versatile than natural oils.
  - Perfect for a **narrow band** of effects (e.g., oscillating movement, static wards, standardized heat).

**1850–1900 — Organic vs synthetic divide**
- Natural/creature magic:
  - High bandwidth: lots of potential effects per sample.
  - Tied to ecology, breeding, weather, and politics.
- Synthetic magic:
  - Narrow: great for standardized devices, poor for flexible ritual work.
  - Scalable: factories can churn it out if they have catalysts and Residue.
- By 1900:
  - **Synthetic Houses** exist:
    - Corporations or guilds producing branded synthetics with stable specs.
  - Ideological split:
    - Traditionalists: “True magic is creature-born. Synthetic is brittle imitation.”
    - Modernists: “Synthetic is ethical, controllable, and better for infrastructure.”

**Result:** Magic tech tree forks: **bio-arcane** vs **chem-arcane**, with very different risks.

## 4. Residue as Second Magic — “Field Sorcery & Glitchcraft”

### Core idea
Residue (waste, pollution, field bleed) stops being just a problem and becomes a **second class of magic**.

### Evolution over time

**1600–1700 — Nuisance**
- People notice:
  - Old docks and refinery dumps are “haunted.”
  - Devices misfire more in certain alleys or harbors.
- Initially chalked up to:
  - “Bad luck,” “curses,” or “the beasts’ revenge.”

**1700–1800 — Pattern recognition**
- Some bastard starts **mapping** the misfires:
  - Same streets always flicker lamps.
  - Same district always has “fog-voices” after big refinery pushes.
- They realize Residue is:
  - Spatially distributed.
  - Has **thresholds**: below X no effect, above X weirdness.
- Early experiments:
  - Residue bricks put under floors for cheap “anti-spy” fuzz.
  - Burial grounds saturated with Residue to confuse enemy divination.

**1800–1850 — Residue discipline**
- New “school” of magic:
  - Call them **Blacklines**, **Smogwrights**, whatever.
- They specialize in:
  - Jamming signals.
  - Softening or hardening local reality for devices.
  - Using Residue flows to **move probability and attention**.
- States and corps:
  - Build **Residue towers and sinks** to manage the field:
    - Concentrate it away from rich districts, into poor ones, industrial zones, or sacrificial landscapes.

**1850–1900 — Residue infrastructure**
- Full **Residue grids**:
  - Pipes, conduits, cisterns, vents.
  - Tapped to power specific devices that thrive on instability (illusion screens, misdirection fields, forgetting mists).
- Social fallout:
  - Low-income districts become **Residue sponges**:
    - Cheap housing because it’s literally arcane-wetland.
    - Higher mutation rates, mental health issues, glitch phenomena.
- Rival magic cultures:
  - **Prime engineers** (clean oils, neat engines).
  - **Residue engineers** (fields, jamming, deterrence, “negative magic”).

**Result:** Your world ends up with **two overlapping magical ontologies**:
- Clean, discrete, device-focused magic (oils).
- Messy, ambient, field-focused magic (Residue).

## 3. Attunement — “Put the Magic *In* the People”

### Core idea
Repeated exposure, deliberate dosing, and grafts cause magic to **enter the human (or sapient) body** as a stable-ish feature.

### Evolution over time

**1500–1650 — Accidental attunement**
- Dockworkers, butchers, sailors, refinery staff:
  - Chronic exposure → subtle changes:
    - Cold tolerance, night vision, weird dreams, heightened intuition with certain devices.
- Most seen as:
  - Occupational hazards or “local quirks.”

**1650–1750 — Experimental attunement**
- Certain factions (militaries, cults, desperate guilds) start:
  - Controlled ingestion, injection, or grafting of beast tissue/oil.
- Results:
  - High mortality.
  - Survivors show **repeatable traits**:
    - Faster healing, stronger senses, domain-specific resistances or outputs.
- This births **classes of attuned**:
  - Fireline, frostline, lumen-touched, deep-marked, etc.

**1750–1850 — Codification & law**
- States notice attuned are:
  - Asset in war and industry.
  - Huge threat if uncontrolled.
- Law emerges:
  - **Registration, guild membership, mandatory service**, or outright bans by culture.
- Attunement techniques:
  - More precise: proper dosages, age windows, combinations.
  - Families form **attuned bloodlines** with inherited tendencies.

**1850–1900 — Integrated “bio-arcane tech”**
- Attuned individuals used as:
  - **Living regulators**: they stabilize engines, grids, rituals.
  - **Specialized workers**: deep-mines, subglacial routes, high-Residue maintenance.
- Social stratification:
  - “Clean” vs “Marked.”
  - Some cultures glamorize attuned as the new nobility.
  - Others shove them into dangerous jobs and ghettoize them.

**Result:** Magic has a **technology branch**, a **waste-field branch**, and a **biological human branch**. People themselves become infrastructure.

## 2. Refinement & Process Magic — “Alchemy as Engineering”

### Core idea
Different ways of processing the same oil produce different magical “phases” with distinct behavior. Refinery practice = spell design.

### Evolution over time

**1500–1600 — Crude processing**
- Basic operations:
  - Raw, boiled, smoked, sun-dried.
- Observations:
  - Boiled = better for lamps.
  - Raw = better for healing, but risky.
  - Smoked = more volatile, good for explosives.

**1600–1700 — Multi-stage refining**
- Guilds develop:
  - Fractional distillation types (not by that name, but in practice).
  - Temperature, pressure, and additives to separate “cuts.”
- Nomenclature emerges:
  - “First fire,” “second breath,” “third shadow,” etc., corresponding to fractions.

**1700–1800 — Process as spell**
- Practitioners realize:
  - The **history** of the oil (heat profile, sequence, contact materials) changes its magical personality.
- Two people with the same raw oil can:
  - Produce entirely different effects by running it through different process trees.
- Refinery schools:
  - **Heatroads**: everything solved with thermal gradients.
  - **Coldfolds**: low-temp, compression, crystallization.
  - **Saltwrights**: heavy use of mineral baths, plated tanks, ducting.

**1800–1900 — Industrial spellcraft**
- Refineries turn into:
  - **Programmed pipelines**: each valve, tank, and coil is part of a known “ritual path.”
- Engineers think in:
  - **Recipes** and **unit operations**:
    - “We need a phase-2 luminant fraction with a coldfold finish and a slow decay curve.”
- Magic R&D:
  - New processes = new spells.
  - Critically: new processes also change **Residue profiles**, feeding back into branch 4.

**Result:** “What spell can we cast?” becomes almost identical to **“What processes can our infrastructure run?”**

## How these branches mesh (in Norbela terms)

You now have:
- **Ecosystem magic (1)** giving you the *source diversity* and regional flavors.
- **Co-evolution (8)** making that source dynamic and adversarial.
- **Synthetic magic (9)** trying to break dependence on living stock.
- **Residue magic (4)** as the second, ambient layer of the world.
- **Attunement (3)** putting the system inside bodies and bloodlines.
- **Refinement (2)** turning industrial process into full spell design.

Taken together, that gives Norbela a magic system that:
- Changes **over time** (biology + tech + politics).
- Diverges across **space** (biomes and cultures).
- Splits across **ontology** (device magic, residue fields, living magic).

The fun part now is deciding:
- Which of these branches are **dominant** by 1900,
- Which are **fringe but rising**,
- And which are **suppressed or taboo**—perfect fuel for stories.
