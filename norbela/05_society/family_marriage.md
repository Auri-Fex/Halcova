# Family and Marriage

> **Quick Summary**: Marriage customs vary drastically by caste—from political arrangements among barons to informal partnerships among workers to forced breeding programs for slaves.

## By Caste

### Upper Castes (Shyakor/Meshkorin)

**Marriage**:
- Arranged for political/economic alliance
- Dowries: territories, trade rights, shyak reserves (upper) or money/property (middle)
- Polygamy common among barons
- Divorce allowed but expensive

**Children**:
- Raised by servants/tutors
- Political assets
- Groomed for power
- Illegitimate: acknowledged if useful, otherwise killed/exiled

### Middle Castes (Telkorin)

**Marriage**:
- Arranged and romantic both occur
- Modest dowries
- Monogamy enforced socially
- Divorce possible but ruinous

**Children**:
- 1-3 typical
- Expensive to raise/educate
- Often apprenticed away
- Illegitimate: hidden or integrated

### Lower Castes (Korbal)

**Marriage**:
- Informal partnerships (marriage too expensive)
- No dowries
- Monogamy ideal, frequently broken
- Divorce: just leave

**Children**:
- 4-8 born, 2-4 survive
- Work from age 6-8
- Illegitimate common, no stigma

### Indentured/Slaves

**Marriage**:
- No legal marriages (property can't marry)
- Breeding programs common (forced partnerships)

**Children**:

## Gender Roles

**Upper Castes**: Patriarchal (barons almost always male)  
**Middle/Lower**: Egalitarian-ish (survival > gender roles)  
**Slaves**: Equal exploitation

**Sexuality**: Bisexuality common in elite; heteronormativity in middle; no one cares in lower tiers
