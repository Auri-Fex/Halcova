# Alternative Fuels

> **Quick Summary**: As shyak becomes scarce, alternatives like fauxil (synthetic blend), slagcells (runoff batteries), and bonewire (bone conduits) proliferate—all inferior, unstable, and dangerous, but necessary for the underclass.

**In this article:**
- Fauxil (Alchemical Mimicry)
- Slagcells (Runoff Batteries)
- Bonewire (Resonant Bone Conduits)
- Drugs and Byproducts
- Innovation vs Desperation

## Fauxil (Alchemical Mimicry)

**Composition**:
- Mundane chemicals (petroleum, alcohol, glycerin)
- Trace magical oil runoff or sludge (5-15%)
- Alchemical catalysts
- Stabilizers (usually inadequate)

**How It Works**:
- Runoff provides minimal magical "seed"
- Chemical reactions amplify effect
- Mimics shyak properties poorly
- Unstable and unpredictable

**Quality Tiers**:
- **Premium Fauxil** (15% runoff): Semi-reliable, 50-60% shyak effectiveness
- **Standard Fauxil** (10% runoff): Unstable, 30-40% effectiveness  
- **Cut Fauxil** (5% runoff): Dangerous, 15-25% effectiveness
- **Street Fauxil** (<5%): Barely works, often explodes

**Uses**:
- Lighting (flickering, dim)
- Basic heating
- Low-power devices
- Underclass desperation

**Risks**:
- Device damage frequent
- Explosions common
- Toxic fumes
- Magical contamination
- Shortened device lifespan

**Price**: 5-15 GS per liter (vs 25-100 for real shyak)

**Legality**: Technically illegal; widely tolerated for underclass

---

## Slagcells (Runoff Batteries)

**Manufacture**:
1. Collect refinery runoff (sludge, ash, contaminated residue)
2. Crystallize using alchemical process
3. Trap residual magic in solid matrix
4. Package as rechargeable battery

**Charging**:
- Place in contact with runoff sources
- Absorbs ambient magical waste
- Takes hours to days
- Diminishing returns over time

**Discharge**:
- Provides weak magical current
- Duration: Minutes to hours depending on charge
- Power: 10-30% of equivalent shyak
- Degrades with each cycle

**Applications**:
- Emergency lighting
- Communication devices (short range)
- Minor enchantments
- Wearables and small tools

**Failure Modes**:
- Sudden discharge (shock hazard)
- Cracking (leaks toxic residue)
- Overcharge explosion
- Complete failure (inert)
- Magical "short circuit"

**Price**: 2-10 GS per cell (single use effectively)

**Legality**: Legal but heavily regulated; quality varies wildly

## Bonewire (Resonant Bone Conduits)

**Source**: Bones and exoskeletons of magical creatures

**Properties**:
- Naturally resonate with stored magical energy
- Amplify and conduct arcane power
- Work even after creature death
- Permanent (unlike consumable fuels)

**Processing**:
1. Clean and cure bones
2. Carve into wires, rods, plates
3. Infuse with small amount of shyak
4. Install in devices as conduits

**Functions**:
- **Conductors**: Transmit magic long distances
- **Amplifiers**: Boost weak shyak signals
- **Networks**: Create linked device systems
- **Adapters**: Allow devices to use multiple fuel types

**Advantages**:
- One-time cost (no fuel consumption)
- Enhances efficiency of whatever fuel used
- Enables advanced applications
- Long-lasting if maintained

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires creature bones (controversial)
- Degrades with overuse (cracks, loses resonance)
- Can attract magical predators
- Unshielded bonewire causes side effects

**Side Effects**:
- Headaches near active bonewire
- Disturbing dreams
- Magical sensitivity fluctuations
- Rare cases of resonance sickness

**Legality**:
- Legal in most regions (with permits)
- Banned in some (ethical concerns)
- Cultural taboos vary
- Black market thriving

**Price**: 50-200 GS per meter (depending on source creature)

## Drugs and Byproducts

### Vaporshade

**Source**: Distilled arcane vapors from refineries

**Effects**:
- Hallucinations
- Enhanced magical perception
- Intuition boost
- Euphoria

**Risks**:
- Highly addictive
- Paranoia
- Permanent magical "echoes" in vision
- Overdose causes madness

**Use**: Underclass escapism, desperate mages

**Price**: 5-20 GS per dose

### Sludgebrew

**Source**: Refined magical sludge (waste byproduct)

**Effects**:
- Temporary strength increase
- Magical resistance
- Stamina boost

**Risks**:
- Toxic accumulation
- Mutations
- Magical control loss
- Organ damage

**Use**: Laborers, criminals, gladiators

**Price**: 3-10 GS per dose

### Crystal Dust

**Source**: Ground magical crystal shards (salvaged or stolen)

**Effects**:
- Spellcasting speed increase
- Magical potency boost
- Heightened arcane senses

**Risks**:
- Magical burnout
- Explosive failures when casting
- Crystal growths in body
- Fatal resonance cascade

**Use**: Desperate mages, arcane duelists

**Price**: 20-50 GS per dose

### Others

- **Alchemix**: Synthesized waste; unpredictable effects
- **Glowtallow**: Purified fat; mild euphoria, slight healing
- **Ash Snuff**: Magical ash; alertness, paranoia
- **Runoff Wine**: Fermented sludge; intoxication, visions

All highly dangerous. All widely used by those with no alternatives.

## Innovation vs Desperation

**Genuine Innovation**:
- Some alternatives show real promise
- Bonewire networks genuinely useful
- Fauxil synthesis improving
- Slagcells becoming more stable

**Mostly Desperation**:
- None approach pure shyak quality
- All have serious drawbacks
- Only used because no choice
- "Innovation" often cutting corners further

**The Gap**:
- Elite use pure shyak
- Middle class use standard shyak or premium alternatives
- Underclass use whatever they can get
- Widening disparity

**The Future**:
- Alternatives won't save civilization
- Depletion continues regardless
- False hope or necessary crutch?
- Debate ongoing

---

## In the World

**Street Level**:
- Fauxil dealers on every corner
- Slagcell charging stations (often illegal)
- Bonewire black market thriving
- Drug use rampant

**Factories**:
- Alternatives keep industry limping along
- Constant failures
- Worker injuries frequent
- Productivity declining

**Upper Class**:
- Disdain for alternatives
- Won't use "inferior substitutes"
- Hoard pure shyak
- Exploit underclass desperation

## Story Integration

### Plot Hooks

1. **Perfect Fauxil**: Formula that truly matches shyak; too good to be true?
2. **Bonewire Network**: City-wide grid using creature bones; ethical crisis
3. **Drug Epidemic**: New runoff drug spreading; authorities can't stop it
4. **Slagcell Cascade**: Batch of cells all explode simultaneously; sabotage?
5. **Alternative Monopoly**: Crime lord controls all alternatives; stranglehold on underclass
