# Natural Phenomena

> **Quick Summary**: Norbela's unique celestial mechanics, finyak-infused geology, and magical ecology create spectacular natural phenomena from floating crystal plateaus to subglacial glowing rivers to aurora displays unlike anywhere else.

**In this article:**
- Aurora Displays
- Crystal Formations
- Gravity Anomalies
- Atmospheric Effects
- Seasonal Phenomena

---

## Aurora Displays

**Frequency**: Nightly in polar regions; 3-4 times per week elsewhere
**Colors**: Blues, violets, silvers, prismatic patterns
**Cause**: Interaction between solar wind, magnetic field, and ring particles

**Enhanced by**:
- High-magic seasons (more intense)
- Ring particle infall (creates streaks)
- Crystal formations (refract light)
- Magical creature activity (local intensification)

## Crystal Formations

### Stanyak Ral (Crystal Mantle Ranges)

Towering mountain ranges of translucent crystal and ice refracting blue sunlight into dazzling patterns. Deep finyak veins subtly influence local gravity causing periodic tremors. Peaks emit harmonic vibrations during Pulse Season attracting migratory creatures.

### Blayarch (Floating Crystal Plateaus)

Massive flat crystal formations hovering above surface, held aloft by concentrated finyak fields distorting gravity locally. Cast shifting prismatic shadows. Undersides covered in bioluminescent growths. Occasionally drift or collide, reshaping landscape.

---

## Blayresh (Luminous Subglacial Rivers)

Networks of rivers flowing beneath surface ice, glowing faintly from finyak energy and refracted blue sunlight. Occasionally surface revealing radiant pools supporting bursts of life. Migration waypoints for organisms. Shift course over time carving new caverns.

---

## Gravity Anomalies

**Light Zones**: 5-10% reduced gravity near crystal formations
**Heavy Zones**: 5-10% increased gravity over dense finyak deposits
**Effects**: Floating ice, altered weather patterns, architecture opportunities

---

## Seasonal Phenomena

**Pulse Season**: Finyak surges, bioluminescence peaks, rapid crystal growth, intense auroras
**Dusk Season**: Magical energy wanes, hibernation begins, auroras dim, entropy storms increase
