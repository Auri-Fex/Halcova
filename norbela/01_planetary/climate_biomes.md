# Climate and Biomes

> **Quick Summary**: Norbela is a frigid iceworld where temperatures rarely rise above freezing, with biomes shaped by cold, blue sunlight, and the presence of magical creatures that create vital warmth pockets in an otherwise hostile landscape.

## Overview

Norbela's climate is defined by one word: **cold**. The distant blue sun Blaysol provides insufficient warmth to prevent permanent ice coverage across most of the planet. What makes life possible are localized heat sources—geothermal activity, magical creature metabolism, and concentrated finyak energy creating pockets of relative warmth in a frozen world.

Seasons are marked not by temperature variation (it's always cold) but by shifts in magical energy. The eccentric orbit brings the planet closer to and farther from the sun, affecting both solar radiation and volcanic activity on Meshvalt, which in turn drives magical cycles that creatures and humans depend upon for survival.

## Iceworld Climate

### Global Temperature

**Baseline Conditions**:
- Average global temperature: **-10°C to 0°C**
- Warmest regions (equatorial volcanic): 0°C to 15°C
- Coldest regions (polar): -30°C to -15°C
- Dead zones: Variable, often extremely cold (no life warmth)

**Temperature Varies By**:
- Latitude (equator warmer than poles)
- Altitude (lower is slightly warmer)
- Geothermal activity (volcanic regions significantly warmer)
- Magical creature density (creates local warmth)
- Time of day/night (45-hour cycle creates swings)
- Orbital position (perihelion vs. aphelion)

### Why So Cold?

**Astronomical Factors**:
- Blaysol is distant and relatively cool (blue star)
- Eccentric orbit means long periods far from sun
- Thin atmosphere retains less heat (low gravity)
- Blue wavelength light provides less warmth than yellow-white

**Lack of Greenhouse Effect**:
- Thin atmosphere with less CO₂
- Limited volcanic outgassing (compared to Earth)
- Ice coverage reflects sunlight (albedo effect)
- Perpetuates cold cycle

**Survival Mechanisms**:
- Geothermal hotspots provide oases
- Magical creatures metabolize finyak → generate heat
- Settlements cluster around warmth sources
- Technology and magic supplement natural heat
