## Overview

Norbela is shaped by deep, primordial forces—long before the rise of civilization or human influence. Its foundation is the arcane substrate known as **finyak** (Aetherite), a mineral and energy field that suffuses the planet's crust, mantle, and atmosphere. The distribution and density of finyak determine the flow of magic, the fertility of life, and the emergence of extraordinary phenomena.

**Only animals possess magic.** All other natural phenomena (weather, substrate, plants, fungi, crystals) are non-magical unless directly affected by magical animals. Humans cannot extract, use, or directly sense finyak or magic. All usable magic, **shyak** (arcane oil), and arcane energy must be harvested from magical creatures that metabolize finyak. These creatures and their symbiotic microfauna are the sole source of magical power.

The world orbits **Blaysol** (Kalen-Tal, "Bright Sky"), a distant blue sun that casts pale blue or icy white light across a frozen landscape. This iceworld borders on uninhabitable, with temperatures ranging from -30°C to 15°C depending on region and season. Life clusters around geothermal hotspots, arcane energy concentrations, and the warmth-generating presence of magical creatures.

## Physical Characteristics

### Planetary Parameters

**Size and Gravity**
- **Diameter**: 75% of Earth's (≈ 9,557 km)
- **Gravity**: ~0.56g (56% of Earth's gravity)
- **Surface Area**: Approximately 287 million km²

The reduced gravity affects everything from movement to geological formations. Humans and lifeforms tend to be taller and lighter. Mountains, plateaus, and crystal formations achieve dramatic heights impossible on Earth. The atmosphere is thinner and colder, supporting vivid auroras and extreme weather patterns.

**Planetary Shape**
The planet is an **oblate spheroid**: the equator bulges outward, and the poles are flattened due to rotation and finyak anomalies. Localized crystal mantle ranges and finyak veins create additional surface bulges and irregularities.

Gravity varies by location:
- Weaker at the equator
- Stronger at the poles
- "Light zones" near crystal bulges
- "Heavy zones" near dense finyak deposits

**Rotation and Day Length**
- **Day Length**: [PENDING: 42-48 hours recommended]
- **Effect**: Prolonged daylight and darkness create extreme temperature swings and dramatic visual effects

The long rotation period forces lifeforms to adapt with:
- Extended hibernation cycles
- Nocturnal vs. diurnal specialization
- Bursts of activity during favorable light/temperature periods
- Cultural adaptation to long work shifts and sleep cycles

**Orbital Period and Year**
- **Year Length**: [PENDING: 420-480 days recommended]
- **Orbit Type**: Highly eccentric (distance from sun varies dramatically)

The eccentric orbit creates:
- Long, harsh winters when far from Blaysol
- Short, intense summers during close approach
- Extreme climate variation throughout the year
- Dramatic shifts in aurora activity and magical energy

### Climate and Temperature

**Base Climate**: Iceworld
- Average global temperature: -5°C to 10°C
- Most regions permanently frozen or near-frozen
- Geothermal and arcane hotspots provide rare warmth
- Weather dominated by blizzards, ice storms, and magical phenomena

**Temperature Ranges by Region**:
- **Vashor** (North): -30°C to -5°C (extreme cold)
- **Tavanor** (Temperate): -5°C to 10°C (mildest)
- **Sulenor** (Volcanic): 0°C to 20°C in volcanic zones
- **Eshtor** (Forest): -5°C to 15°C (humid microclimate)
- **Konor** (Desert): -10°C to 10°C (cold, arid)

## Magical Foundation

### Finyak: The Primordial Substrate

Deep beneath Norbela's surface lies **finyak**, a rare mineral or energy field that is the wellspring of all magic. Finyak predates all known life and its emanations suffuse the land, air, and water with arcane potential.

**Properties of Finyak**:
- Ancient, possibly older than the planet itself
- Exists in varying concentrations across regions
- Cannot be directly accessed by mining or extraction
- Only magical creatures can metabolize it
- Concentration determines local magical strength

**Distribution**:
- Highest in crystal mantle ranges (Stanyak Ral)
- Moderate in volcanic zones and ancient forests
- Depleted in **shisolak** (arcane deserts/dead zones)
- Variable in atmosphere as airborne particles

For detailed mechanics, see [[Finyak Substrate]].

### The Source of Magic

**Critical Principle**: Humans possess ZERO innate magical ability.

All magic on Norbela follows this chain:

1. **Finyak** exists in substrate, atmosphere, and geological formations
2. **Magical creatures** metabolize finyak through specialized biology
3. **Symbiotic microfauna** within creatures convert finyak to magical oil
4. **Shyak (arcane oil)** is extracted from creatures (usually post-mortem)
5. **Devices and technology** burn/channel shyak to produce magical effects

Without magical creatures, there is no usable magic. Without finyak, creatures cannot produce oil. The entire civilization depends on this biological/geological cycle.

### What is NOT Magical

To be absolutely clear:
- **Weather**: Entirely natural (cold, blizzards, wind)
- **Substrate**: Non-magical rock, minerals, ice
- **Plants**: No inherent magic; normal photosynthesis adapted to blue light
- **Fungi**: Non-magical; ecological roles only
- **Crystals**: Geological formations; no innate magic
- **Auroras**: Natural atmospheric phenomenon (though enhanced by finyak in air)
- **Floating Ice**: Geological/glacial processes, not magic

The only magical phenomena visible on the surface are those created by **magical animals**: bioluminescence, environmental changes, temperature regulation, or arcane effects from their presence.

## Ecological Systems

### Life and Finyak Symbiosis

Life on Norbela evolved in symbiosis with finyak, giving rise to a unique ecosystem:

**Magical Creatures**
- Range from simple energy-feeders to complex, sentient beings
- Each adapted to local finyak conditions
- Produce shyak through symbiotic microfauna
- Essential to ecosystem balance

**Symbiotic Microfauna**
- Microscopic organisms living within magical creatures
- Metabolize trace finyak exposure
- Transform nutrients + finyak into magical oil
- Health of microbes determines oil quality and yield

**Non-Magical Life**
- Plants, fungi, and simple animals have no magic
- Adapted to extreme cold and blue-spectrum sunlight
- Often cluster near magical creatures for warmth
- Form support ecosystems around arcane energy concentrations

### Biomes

Major biome types adapted to iceworld conditions:

1. **Enchanted Frost Forests**: Crystal growths refract blue sunlight; magical creatures create warmth pockets
2. **Fungal Ice Jungles**: Dense fungal colonies; high biodiversity; damp and humid microclimates
3. **Crystal Snowfields**: Vast expanses of ice and crystal formations; sparse but spectacular life
4. **Volcanic Badlands**: Heat from geological activity; rare warm zones; fire-adapted creatures
5. **Arcane Tundra**: Windswept plains; minimal cover; hearty magical megafauna
6. **Frozen Wetlands**: Ice-locked swamps and marshes; seasonal thaws; rich fungal growth
7. **Arcane Glacial Deserts** (Shisolak): Depleted zones; entropy storms; hostile to all life

See [[Climate and Biomes]] for detailed descriptions.

### Ecosystem Balance

The ecosystem is maintained by:
- Cycles of finyak absorption, transformation, and release
- Predation adapted to magical energy needs
- Symbiotic relationships between magical and non-magical life
- Migration patterns following finyak concentrations
- Competition for arcane-rich territories

Human interference through **over-extraction** threatens this balance, accelerating the spread of **shenesh** (magical entropy) and creating expanding dead zones.
