# Konor (The Dying Land)

> **Quick Summary**: Konor is a dying continent where 60% is already dead zones, population has collapsed from 750,000 to 200,000, and Baron Meshira-Tal is desperately searching ancient ruins for a superweapon to either save Konor or hold the world hostage.

- Overcrowded refugee camps
- Disappearing yearly

**Ancient Ruins**:
- Pre-collapse cities
- Buried treasures
- Forbidden knowledge
- Extreme danger

---

## Settlements

**Former Capital** (30,000):
- 90% abandoned
- Refugee camps in ruins
- Starvation ongoing
- Cannibalism confirmed
- Meshira-Tal's last stronghold

**Shira-Nesh** (50,000 - on Sulenor border):

- Warlords and violence
- Last escape route

**Scattered Camps** (120,000 total):
- Temporary settlements

- Waiting to die or flee

---

## Economy

**COLLAPSED**:

**Former Economy**:
- Was agricultural and mining
- Supported 750,000 people
- Prosperous 200 years ago

**Current "Economy"**:
- Salvaging ancient ruins (5% of continental shyak - all salvage)
- Black market
- Human trafficking
- Cannibalism
- Imports everything (can't pay)

**Debt**:
- Owes millions to other barons
- Bankruptcy imminent
- No credit left
- Begging for aid (denied)

---

## Politics

**Meshira-Tal's Desperation**:

**Demands to Council**:
- Massive aid package
- Free shyak shipments
- Debt forgiveness
- Relocation assistance

**Council Response**:
- Unanimous rejection
- "Not our problem"
- "You failed, face consequences"

**Ultimatum**:
- Meshira-Tal searching ruins for ancient weapon
- Threatens to use unless aided
- Countdown: Months
- Council: "We don't negotiate with terrorists"

**Reality**:
- May actually find something
- Desperate enough to use it
- Could trigger global catastrophe
- Or may be bluffing (probably not)

---

## The Exodus

**550,000 Fled** (in 50 years):
- Most to other regions
- Borders mostly closed now
- Refugee camps overflow
- Violence at checkpoints
- Thousands dying in transit

**200,000 Remain**:
- Too poor to leave
- Waiting for miracle
- Starving
- Dying
- Eating each other

**Reception**:
- Tavanor: Limited acceptance (camps)
- Sulenor: Enslaved immediately
- Eshtor: Turned away
- Vashor: Frozen before arriving
- Nowhere wants them

---

## Dangers

**Entropy Storms** (Daily):

- Mutate anything caught

## The Weapon Search

**What Meshira-Tal Seeks**:
- Ancient superweapon in deep ruins
- Pre-collapse technology
- Possibly entropy-reversal device
- Or mass-destruction weapon
- Uncertain which

**Expedition**:
- Launched 3 months ago
- 100 best salvagers
- Arcane equipment
- High fatality rate
- No news yet

**Possibilities**:
1. Find nothing (most likely)
2. Find weapon, threaten world
3. Find weapon, accidentally destroy Konor
4. Find weapon, accidentally destroy continent
5. Find weapon, successfully reverse entropy (impossible)
6. Die in ruins (likely)

**Timeline**:
- Meshira-Tal's deadline: 6 months
- Council's patience: 0

## Cautionary Tale

**What Konor Represents**:
- Future of entire continent
- Consequences of over-extraction
- End state of entropy spread
- What happens when magic runs out
- What happens when barons ignore warnings

**Lessons**:
- Conservation is not optional
- Depletion is real
- Extinction is possible
- Nobody will save you
- It can happen anywhere

**Current Status**:
- Other regions still extracting aggressively
- Learning nothing from Konor
- "Won't happen to us"
