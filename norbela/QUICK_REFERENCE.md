## The 30-Second Pitch

Frigid iceworld orbiting a blue sun. All magic comes from creatures that eat finyak (primordial substrate). Humans extract shyak (arcane oil) from animals to power 1880s magitech. Industrial civilization consuming itself to death. 40% dead zones and expanding. Rigid seven-caste system where shyak access = life quality. Extinction projected in 10-30 years. Elite refuse conservation.

## Core Rules

1. **Only animals have magic** - No exceptions, no human wizards
2. **Cold dominates** - Iceworld, survival requires warmth sources
3. **Devices need fuel** - Shyak powers everything, no fuel = no function
4. **Entropy accumulates** - Every use has environmental cost
5. **Dead zones expand** - 40% of world already dead, growing 10%/year
6. **Caste is visible** - Clothing, health, access immediately obvious
7. **Barons won't change** - Systemic resistance to conservation

## The Magic Chain

**Finyak** (substrate) → **Creatures** (metabolize) → **Shyak** (oil) → **Devices** (burn it) → **Entropy** (pollution)

- Only creature-derived fuel works
- No alternatives discovered
