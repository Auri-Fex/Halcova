## 1500-1540: Discovery & Alchemical Sail

### The Breakthrough

**When**: ~1515-1520
**Where**: Aurora coasts, ice-choked seas, harsh creature-rich regions
**Who**: Explorers, hunters, desperate sailors

**What They Found**:
Certain creatures bleed or secrete **oils and tissues that behave like concentrated, semi-stable magic**:
- Burn hotter than any natural fuel
- Cling to metal, resist frost
- Sometimes mend flesh (or twist it)
- Never seem to run out (when pure)

**Initial Response**: Miracle, not industry
- Temples hoard "saint-lamps" (never go out)
- Nobles commission healing baths, salves, amulets
- Mad tinkers strap crude pistons and bellows (catastrophic failures common)
- Most people don't understand what they have

### Technology Level (1500)

**Baseline**: Late medieval / early Age of Sail
- Caravels and cogs
- Muscle, wind, water power
- Early bombards and hand-gonnes (unreliable)
- Iron Age metalworking

**Population**: ~4-5 million globally
**Dead Zones**: <5% (natural entropy only)
**Creature Populations**: Healthy, sustainable

### Early Adoption

**Maritime Uses**:
- Ships carrying arcane lamps push into longer nights, heavier fog, ice
- Captains test "witch oil" on hulls (frost-shedding coatings, hardened spars)
- Quiet experimentation (church suspicious)

**Medical**:
- Healing salves (work, but unpredictable)
- Life extension (elite only, side effects)
- Prosthetics (early, crude)

**Religious Controversy**:
- Is this divine gift or demonic?
- Some faiths embrace (miracle)
- Others condemn (witchcraft)
- Political power plays around control

**By 1540**: World is late medieval with alchemical cheat codes in rich/lucky hands

## 1540-1600: Arcane Age of Discovery

### Scaling the Miracle

**What Changed**:
- Hunters and sailors start targeting specific creature grounds
- Crude grading appears:
  - "Lamp oil" vs "medicinal" vs "engine-worthy"
- Early port-refineries:
  - Boil, strain, separate gunk into predictable fractions

### Exploration Becomes Bio-Cartography

**New Goal**: Map creatures, not just continents

**Charts Now Record**:
- Currents and winds (traditional)
- **Creature habitats** (spawning, migration, death)
- **Aurora intensity** (affects creature behavior)
- **Seasonal patterns** (high-magic vs low-magic)

**Crown-Chartered Companies Form**:
- Rights to "harvest all witch-beasts" in defined areas
- Proto–East India Companies for biological magic
- Bay, strait, coast claims
- Military backing

**Example**: Tavanor Trading Company (1562)
- Royal charter for eastern coast
- 50-year monopoly
- 10% to crown
- Sparked wars over territories

### Military and Infrastructure

**Ports Adopt**:
- Arcane bilge pumps
- Arcane capstans and dock cranes
- Still one-off artisanal devices (no standardization)

**Navies and Pirates**:
- Oil-treated hulls (tougher, slippery in ice/surf)
- Explosive/incendiary oils in boarding and sieges
- Arcane advantages in naval warfare
- Arms race begins

**By 1600**: Any serious power knows:
**"Global power = who controls the magical creature grounds"**

**Population**: ~6-7 million
**Dead Zones**: ~5-8% (localized around early extraction sites)

## 1600-1650: Proto-Industrial Revolution

### The Energy Pivot

**Leading States Now Have**:
- Regular supply of key creature products
- Dedicated port refineries
- First attempts at non-lethal extraction
- Semi-managed breeding grounds

**Waste Accumulates**:
- Sludge, blood, bone, residue
- Piles up at refineries
- Pollution visible
- No disposal plan

### Alt-Fuel Birth

**Fauxil Bricks**:
- Tinkerers compress sludge + plant matter + ash
- Dirty, weaker than true oil, but cheap and scalable
- Powers lower-class districts
- Industrial applications

**Slagcells (Early)**:
- Low-grade residue bottled and wired
- Single-use magi-batteries
- Lamps, triggers, toys
- Unstable but useful

### Proto-Industry Emerges

**Hybrid Systems**:
- Mills and mines combine:
  - Waterwheel for baseline
  - Arcane engines for startup torque, heavy lifting, peak loads
- More efficient than pure muscle power
- Still dangerous

**Line-Work**:
- Primitive automata and golems
- Handle repetitive tasks (hammering, gate-lifting, bellows-pumping)
- "Half of them are OSHA violations with legs"
- Worker injuries common

### Urban Transformation

**Rich Districts**:
- Arcane streetlamps (reliable)
- Clinic-rigs (miracle surgeries for elite)
- Climate control (limited)
- Status symbol

**Poor Districts**:
- Lanterns on cheap fauxil
- Occasional glitch devices
- Wild black-market rigs
- Explosions frequent

**Class Divide Grows**: Access to quality magic = wealth

### Exploration Moves Inland

**Coasts Mapped**: Move to extreme environments

**New Targets**:
- Subglacial rivers
- Interior frozen basins
- Canyon biomes
- Upland aurora bands

**Expeditions**:
- Sled caravans with arcane heaters
- Beacon pylons
- Hazardous submersibles (deep creature swarms)
- High mortality (30-50%)

**By 1650**: Early Industrial Revolution analogue, shifted up a century
Factories exist, but engine in basement is "snarling magical biology problem"

**Population**: ~8-10 million
**Dead Zones**: ~10-12% (industrialization accelerating spread)

---

## 1650-1700: Clockwork Baroque

### Industrial Maturity (v1)

**Infrastructure**:
- Sled-rail/proto-rail networks (fixed routes through snow/ice)
- Arcane icebreakers (iron hulls, hybrid engines)
- Factory belts (textiles, armaments, shipbuilding)
- Standardized arcane engines

**Automation**:
- Better automata:
  - Crane-walkers
  - Track-runners
  - Moving goods and ore
- Still dangerous but productive

### Communications Revolution

**Arcane Telegraph-Like Networks**:
- Residue-stable channels along roads/rails
- Beacon towers (ship-to-shore optical/arcane signaling)
- Messages travel in hours (not days)
- Military/commercial advantage

**Information Age Begins**:
- News spreads faster
- Markets coordinate
- Political intelligence
- Espionage crucial

### Daily Life Stratification

**Elite**:
- Heated homes
- Reliable lighting
- Controlled climate (limited zones)
- Medical arcane tech (healing tanks, prosthetics)
  - Known costs: Residue load, mild mutation, shortened lifespan

**Underclass**:
- Live in the exhaust
- Fauxil smoke, slag-run devices
- Frequent malfunctions
- Cheap knockoff engines
- Bonewire networks (low-grade Residue)
- Health crisis emerging

### Ecological Hit

**Multiple Keystone Species Hit Hard**:
- Near ports and industrial centers
- Population crashes
- Migration pattern disruptions
- Ecosystem damage

**Residue Accumulates**:
- Glitchy zones (devices misfire)
- Illusions persist
- "Local physics gets grabby"
- Entropy precursors

**State Response**:
- Early Conservation Edicts (breeding reserves, seasonal bans)
- Hunting quotas
- Granted monopolies to "responsible" companies
- Mostly ignored

**By 1700**: Industrialized early and already hit first major resource/pollution limits

**Population**: ~10-12 million
**Dead Zones**: ~15-18% (conservation efforts failing)

## 1700-1750: First Arcane Crash

### Overreach Arrives

**Long-Term Overharvest Means**:
- Some species collapse regionally
- Others shift migration (unpredictably)
- Supply becomes unreliable
- Prices spike

**Residue Levels Hit Critical**:
"You can't ignore this anymore" line crossed

**Cities Suffer Residue Storms**:
- Widespread device failure
- Short-lived reality distortions
- Spikes in mental illness, birth defects
- "Haunted" districts
- Panic and exodus

### Economic Shock

**Factories in Affected Regions**:
- Lose reliable fuels
- Unsafe operating conditions
- Some urban belts rust out
- Shutdowns and unemployment

**Power Blocs Split**:

1. **Maximalists** (Koresh-Val's ancestors):
   - Push further out
   - Invade new biomes
   - Burn harder, faster
   - "Growth or death"

2. **Retrenchers** (Shalen-Mor's line):
   - Ration oil
   - Fall back to wind/water/fauxil
   - Conservation focus
   - "Survival requires restraint"

3. **Alt-Fuel Evangelists** (merchants, innovators):
   - Push slagcells, fauxil, bonewire as primary
   - "Technology will save us"
   - Innovation over extraction

### Sail's Temporary Comeback

**Arcane Engines** become expensive and fragile

**Sail Advantages**:
- Wind doesn't glitch in Residue storms
- Low-arcana ships move through contaminated routes
- Cheaper to operate
- More reliable

**But**: Slower, less powerful, limited capacity

**Result**: Mixed fleets (sail + arcane hybrid)

### First Arcane Depression

**Not Total Collapse**: Nasty correction

**Forces Rethink**:
- "Infinite magic forever" illusion shattered
- Need for conservation clear
- Alt-fuels necessary
- Pollution real problem

**Casualties**:
- Economic: Millions unemployed
- Environmental: Species extinctions begin
- Human: Increased mortality from device failures
- Political: Governments fall, new powers rise

**By 1750**: World forced to adapt or die

**Population**: ~11-13 million (growth slowed)
**Dead Zones**: ~18-22% (expansion accelerated during crash)

---

## 1750-1780: Conservation Compacts Era

### The Compromise

**All Powers Converge on Insight**:
> "We treat prime creature-oil like enriched uranium. Everything else runs on trash and cleverness."

### Creature Management

**Breeding Reserves & Farms**:
- Islands, tunnels, floating pens
- Purpose-built tundra corridors
- Emerging field of arcane biology:
  - Selective breeding (higher yield, calmer temperament, faster regeneration)
  - Genetic manipulation (early, crude)

**International/Inter-Regional Compacts**:
- Carve up species and habitats into spheres of influence
- Limit culls (on paper)
- Allow recovery windows
- Enforcement weak but exists

**Example**: Treaty of Crystal Caverns (1762)
- Nine regional powers
- Quotas established
- Penalties (rarely enforced)
- Framework for baron system

### Alt-Fuel Scaling

**Fauxil**:
- Standardized bricks and liquids
- Plant, bone, sludge sources
- Fuels domestic heat, low-end engines, frontier tech
- 40% of total energy by 1780

**Slagcells**:
- Industrial-scale production
- Supplies: street lighting, streetcars, hand-tools, minor engines
- 25% of energy

**Bonewire & Gutter-Tech**:
- Cheap Residue-laced networks
- Poor/far districts
- Unstable, glitch-prone
- 10% of energy

**Prime Oil**: 25% of energy (rationed, expensive)

### Infrastructure Rebuild

**Cities Retrofit**:
- Residue scrubbers, sink towers, piping
- Channel runoff (attempt to contain)
- Magic zoning: heavy-engine districts vs "clean" quarters
- Wealth determines zone access

**Factories**:
- Reengineer to mixed stacks:
  - Prime oil only at key nodes
  - Fauxil and slagcells for rest
- More efficient
- Still polluting

### Exploration Phase II

**Most Coastlines/Routes Known**

**New Frontiers**:
- Deep subglacial seas
- Tectonic rifts
- Sky-bands (weird weather and creatures)
- Vertical exploration (up and down, not out)

**Expeditions Use**:
- Hybrid sled-rail caravans
- Semi-autonomous rigs
- Early pressure-suits and deep-divers
- High-tech for era

**By ~1780**: World re-stabilized on tri-fuel footing:
- Prime oil (rare)
- Engineered Residue (dirty but potent)
- Fauxil/sludge (mass, cheap)

**Population**: ~12-14 million
**Dead Zones**: ~22-25% (stable for now)

**Stage Set**: For industrial explosion of next century
