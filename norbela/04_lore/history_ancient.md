# History: Ancient Era (Pre-1500)

> **Quick Summary**: Before recorded history began in earnest, Norbela was warmer, richer in finyak, and possibly home to advanced civilizations that left only ruins and warnings in dead zones—suggesting this cycle of extraction and collapse has happened before.

**In this article:**
- The Lost Ages
- Pre-Collapse Civilization
- The Seventh and Eighth Continents Theory
- Early Human Settlements
- Medieval Foundations (1000-1500)

## The Lost Ages (Unknown-1000)

### What We Don't Know

**The Gap**:
- Reliable written records only go back ~1,000 years
- Before that: oral traditions, myths, fragments
- Ruins suggest much older civilizations
- Dead zones may contain complete lost cities

**Theories**:
1. **Cyclical Collapse**: This has happened before; previous civilizations rose, over-extracted, died
2. **Single Ancient Civilization**: One great pre-collapse culture fell; we rebuilt from scraps
3. **Multiple Cultures**: Different societies at different times; not all connected
4. **Natural Development**: Humans evolved here normally; no dramatic prehistory

**Evidence**:
- Ruins in dead zones (can't be studied, too dangerous)
- Ancient texts reference "before times"
- Technology that shouldn't exist yet (discovered, not invented?)
- Genetic diversity suggests long presence

---

## Pre-Collapse Civilization

### The Ruins

**What's Found**:
- Massive structures in dead zones (seen from distance)
- Advanced architecture (beyond medieval capability)
- Devices and artifacts (many non-functional)
- Written languages (partially deciphered)

**Central Tavanor Dead Zone**:
- Buried city at center
- Was capital (evidence suggests)
- Predates current kingdoms by centuries
- Created or destroyed by Second Cascade? (Unclear)

**The Undercity** (beneath Kalen-Sheloth):
- Ancient intact structures
- Pre-dates current city by 500+ years
- Functional artifacts still found
- Suggests earlier advanced settlement

**Konor Ruins**:
- Entire dead zone littered with cities
- Some only 200 years old (recent collapse)
- Others ancient (1,000+ years)
- Pattern: civilizations rose, extracted, died

### The Seventh and Eighth Continents Theory

**The Claim**:
Ancient texts reference "seventh and eighth" continents

**Current Reality**:
Only five continents exist (six if you count fragments)

**Hypothesis**:
- Two entire continents consumed by dead zones
- Happened long ago (1,000+ years?)
- Complete extinction of populations
- Land masses still exist but uninhabitable

**Counter-Arguments**:
- May be metaphorical (spiritual realms?)
- Translation errors
- Exaggeration or myth
- Continental drift (geological, not magical)

**Implications If True**:
- This cycle is ancient
- Extinction has happened before
- Current crisis not unprecedented
- May be inevitable

**Search**:
- Some scholars seek proof
- Expeditions into oldest dead zones (fatal)
- Most dismiss as myth
- Debate ongoing

## Early Human Settlements (1000-1400)

### Late Medieval Period

**Technology Level**:
- Iron Age to early medieval
- Muscle, wind, water power
- No magic technology yet
- Sustainable extraction only

**Population**:
- ~2-3 million globally (estimated)
- Concentrated near creature habitats
- Nomadic and settled both
- Regional kingdoms emerging

**Creature Interaction**:
- Hunting for food and materials
- Small-scale oil extraction (medicinal)
- Religious significance (some worshiped)
- Sustainable equilibrium

**Geography**:
- All five continents inhabited
- Travel difficult but possible
- Regional isolation common
- Trade routes primitive

### Early Kingdoms

**Tavanor**:
- Academic traditions begin
- First universities (monasteries)
- Knowledge preservation
- Political unification starting

**Sulenor**:
- Volcanic forge culture
- Metalworking expertise
- Fire-creature rituals
- Religious centers

**Eshtor**:
- Forest tribes
- Mega-tree settlements
- Creature symbiosis
- Oral traditions

**Vashor**:
- Nomadic clans
- Ice survival mastery
- Isolation from others
- Hardy culture

**Konor**:
- Agricultural prosperity
- Large population
- Irrigation networks
- Peaceful era

## The Discovery Era Prelude (1400-1500)

### Building Momentum

**Population Growth**:
- 3-4 million globally
- Cities emerging
- Agriculture improving
- Trade expanding

**Technology**:
- Late medieval peak
- Sailing ships
- Better metalworking
- Early firearms (unreliable)

**Creature Knowledge**:
- Hunters know habitats
- Some breeding attempts
- Medicinal uses documented
- Still religious/mystical understanding

**Political Structure**:
- Regional kingdoms
- Baron system emerging
- Loose federations
- Frequent conflicts (small scale)

**The Breakthrough Approaching**:
- Explorers push into harsh regions
- Discovery of concentrated oils imminent
- 1500s will change everything
- Last era of equilibrium

## Lost Knowledge

### What Ancient Texts Suggest

**Warnings**:
- "Do not extract beyond regeneration"
- "The substrate depletes; guard it"
- "Entropy spreads when balance breaks"
- "We were warned; we didn't listen"

**Blueprints**:
- Advanced devices in ruins
- Some match current technology
- Others beyond understanding
- Suggesting knowledge lost and rediscovered

**Maps**:
- Continental outlines accurate
- Some show features now buried in dead zones
- Others show continents that don't exist
- Navigation aids or myths?

**Philosophy**:
- Debates about extraction ethics (ancient)
- Conservation arguments (pre-crisis)
- Warnings ignored (repeatedly)
- Pattern: each generation thinks "different this time"

## Religious and Mythological Foundations

### Creation Myths

**The Bleeding Heart**:
- Meshvalt moon is heart of dead god
- Eruptions = divine blood
- Magic = gift and curse
- Popular belief

**The Frozen Prison**:
- World is prison for ancient demons
- Magic = demon essence
- Extraction = freeing demons gradually
- Eshtor shamanic tradition

**The Cycle**:
- World dies and rebirths
- Current age just one of many
- Entropy = natural death phase
- Konor mystics

**The Sacrifice**:
- Gods gave magic at cost
- Overuse = betraying gift
- Dead zones = divine punishment
- Faith of Fire interpretation

### Cultural Memory

**Oral Traditions**:
- Stories of "warmer times"
- Tales of "green world" (not blue)
- Legends of "yellow sun" (not Blaysol)
- Dismissed as fantasy or symbolism

**Seasonal Myths**:
- High-magic season = blessing
- Low-magic season = punishment
- Lunar cycles sacred
- Aurora as divine messages

**Creature Worship**:
- Some cultures worship magical beasts
- Taboos against harvesting (ignored by barons)
- Shamanic traditions (Eshtor, Vashor)
- Underground in industrial regions

## Archaeological Mysteries

### Unsolved Questions

**The Frozen Archive** (Vashor):
- Rumored pre-collapse library
- Contains "all knowledge"
- Location unknown
- Search ongoing (Nethvor, others)

**The Drowned Temple** (Eshtor):
- Underwater ruins
- Sealed chambers
- Pre-collapse
- Deadly to explore

**Undercity Networks**:
- How extensive?
- Connect to other cities?
- What's still down there?
- Nethvor knows more than telling

**Perfect Crystals**:
- Ancient crystal formations
- Better than modern ones
- Lost technique?
- Natural anomaly?

## Story Integration

### Plot Hooks

1. **Ancient Device**: Discover working pre-collapse technology; power or danger?
2. **Seventh Continent**: Find proof it existed; implications for current crisis
3. **Decoded Warning**: Ancient text reveals specific solution; race to find it
4. **Undercity Expedition**: Explore beneath Kalen-Sheloth; what's really down there?
5. **Frozen Archive Found**: Lost library discovered; contains extinction timeline
6. **Genetic Memory**: Character has visions of ancient times; real or madness?
7. **Curse Fulfilled**: Ancient prophecy coming true; stop it or accept it?
8. **Lost Language**: Decipher ancient script; reveals uncomfortable truths

### Themes

- **History repeats**: Those who don't learn doomed to repeat
- **Lost knowledge**: Ancients knew things we forgot
- **Pride before fall**: Every age thinks they're special
- **Environmental memory**: Land remembers even if people forget
