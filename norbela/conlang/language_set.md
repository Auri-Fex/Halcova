# Conlang Language Set

## Selected Languages

| Role | Language | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Root** | Mongolian | Semantic foundation; direct translation for concept. |
| **Affix** | Hybrid Kiranti | Affix variations for emphasis and nuance. |
| **Mutation** | Fula (Fulani) | Phonetic mutations for transformation. |

## Language Character


**Overall Feel**: Direct, compressed, and easy to pronounce. Words are built from three-language roots, affixes, and mutations, then compressed and adjusted for readability.

**Phonetic Tendencies**:
- Consonants and vowels from Mongolian, Kiranti, and Fula (k, g, t, d, s, sh, y, j, n, m, a, e, i, o, u)
- Syllable blending and vowel/consonant shifts from Fula

**Syllable Patterns**:
- Prefer 1-2 syllables for common words after molting
- Compound words compress heavily

Standard mutations applied during Step 3:

| Original | Mutated | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| a | e | khalimiin → ghelimeen |
| o | u | tos → tus |
| i | e | khalimiin → ghelimeen |
| k | g | khalimiin → ghelimeen |
| t | d | tos → dos |
| s | sh | tos → tosh |
| y | j | yak → jak |
| Addition of n, m | nasalization | tushyak → tushnak |

**Syllable blending and compression applied during molting.**

## Usage Notes


1. **Formal vs. Common**: Longer unmolted forms preserved for ritual, legal, and magical contexts. Molted forms for everyday speech.

2. **Compounds**: When combining concepts, use the shorter affix variants and compress aggressively.

3. **Names**: Personal names follow same construction but may use different affix sets to indicate family, profession, or origin.

4. **Loanwords**: Concepts from other magic systems may retain more of their original structure to mark them as "foreign" to native speakers.
