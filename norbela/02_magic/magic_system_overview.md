# Magic System Overview

> **Quick Summary**: Magic on Norbela comes exclusively from animals who metabolize finyak through symbiotic microbes—humans cannot use magic directly and must harvest shyak (arcane oil) from magical creatures to power all arcane technology.

**In this article:**
- Core Principles
- How Magic Works
- The Magic-Technology Interface
- Limitations and Rules
- Historical Development
- Current State

## Core Principles

### The Fundamental Rule

**ONLY ANIMALS POSSESS MAGIC.**

This is the most important rule of Norbela's magic system:

- **All natural phenomena** (weather, substrate, plants, fungi, crystals) are **non-magical** unless directly affected by magical animals
- **Weather is entirely natural**: cold, blizzards, auroras from Blaysol
- **The land, plants, fungi, and crystals** are non-magical by default
- **Any magical effects** on the environment must originate from animal activity
- **Humans cannot extract, use, or directly sense finyak or magic**

### The Energy Chain

**The complete path from raw magic to usable power:**

1. **Finyak** (primordial substrate) exists deep underground and in atmosphere
2. **Magical creatures** metabolize finyak via symbiotic microfauna
3. **Shyak** (arcane oil) is produced by the microbes and stored in creature tissues
4. **Humans extract** shyak through harvesting (lethal or non-lethal)
5. **Devices burn** shyak to produce magical effects
6. **Byproducts** are released (pollution, entropy, waste)

**Humans are completely dependent on this chain.** There is no "learning magic" or "casting spells"—only building devices that consume harvested biological fuel.

## How Magic Works

### Finyak: The Source

**What it is**:
- Primordial arcane mineral/energy field
- Exists in planetary crust and atmosphere
- Ancient (possibly predates life)
- Finite and depletable
- Cannot be created or destroyed (conservation principle)

**Distribution**:
- Concentrated in certain geological formations
- Delivered to atmosphere via moon eruption → ring → magical rain cycle
- Varies by region and season
- Measurable but not directly usable

**See**: [[Finyak Substrate]] for complete details

### Symbiotic Microfauna: The Converters

**The key to magic**:
- Specialized microbes living in magical creatures
- Only these microbes can metabolize finyak
- Transform finyak + organic nutrients → shyak (arcane oil)
- Host creature provides habitat; microbes provide magic
- Symbiotic relationship essential

**Why only creatures?**:
- No artificial synthesis discovered
- Microbial metabolism requires living host
- Exact mechanism still mysterious
- Attempts to cultivate microbes outside hosts have failed

**See**: [[Symbiotic Microfauna]] for biology details

### Shyak: The Fuel

**Production**:
- Microbes secrete oil into specialized host glands
- Composition varies by species, diet, habitat
- Quality affected by host health and finyak availability
- Continuous production (but limited rate)

**Properties**:
- Energy-rich lipids and proteins
- Magical charge degrades over time
- Sensitive to air, light, certain metals
- Must be stored in treated containers
- Different grades for different uses

**Uses**:
- Direct fuel for devices
- Refined into various products
- Basis of entire economy
- Irreplaceable (no true alternatives)

**See**: [[Shyak Extraction]] for harvesting details

## The Magic-Technology Interface

### How Devices Work

**Engineering Principles**:
- Devices are **not magical themselves**
- Made from standard materials (metal, glass, wood, etc.)
- Designed with reservoirs/cartridges to hold shyak
- Magic only occurs when shyak is consumed
- No enchantments, runes, or inherent power

**Device Categories**:
1. **Arcane Engines**: Vehicles, machinery, heavy equipment
2. **Spell Batteries**: Lighting, communication, defense systems
3. **Transmutation Chambers**: Alchemy labs, medical beds, refineries
4. **Personal Devices**: Weapons, tools, prosthetics, wearables
5. **Constructs**: Golems, automata, animated servants

**Power Sources**:
- **High-Grade Shyak**: Pure, stable, expensive (elite use)
- **Standard Shyak**: Refined, reliable, regulated (middle class)
- **Fauxil**: Synthetic blend with runoff (unstable, cheap)
- **Slagcells**: Runoff batteries (weak, short-lived, underclass)
- **Bonewire**: Bone conduits (enhancers, illegal in some regions)

**See**: [[Alternative Fuels]] for substitutes

### What Magic Can Do

**Capabilities**:
- Energy conversion (heat, light, motion)
- Force generation (lift, push, barriers)
- Material transformation (limited transmutation)
- Information transmission (communication, scrying)
- Life support (healing, preservation, enhancement)
- Sensory manipulation (illusions, detection)

**What Magic CANNOT Do**:
- Violate conservation of energy
- Create matter from nothing
- True resurrection or time manipulation
- Break fundamental physical laws
- Self-sustain indefinitely (fuel always required)

---

## Limitations and Rules

### Physical Limitations

**Fuel Dependency**:
- All magic requires shyak consumption
- Devices stop when fuel exhausted
- No "mana pools" or personal magical energy
- Refueling necessary and often expensive

**Efficiency Losses**:
- Heat waste in all conversions
- Magical entropy increases with use
- Device degradation over time
- Diminishing returns with overuse

**Environmental Factors**:
- Dead zones: magic fails completely
- Low-finyak areas: reduced effectiveness
- High-magic seasons: enhanced performance
- Temperature affects shyak viscosity

### Biological Limitations

**Creature Constraints**:
- Finite magical creature populations
- Slow reproduction rates
- Habitat requirements specific
- Over-harvesting causes collapse

**Extraction Limits**:
- Non-lethal harvesting has recovery period
- Lethal harvesting depletes populations
- Microbe health affects output
- Stress reduces oil quality

**Conservation Crisis**:
- 40% of land already dead zones
- Populations declining globally
- Extinction threatens civilization
- No solution yet found

### Magical Physics

**Arcane Conservation**:
- Total magical energy is finite
- Can be transformed but not created
- Depletion in one area affects others
- Global "budget" being exhausted

**Entropy Accumulation**:
- Every magical process increases entropy
- Makes future magic less stable
- High-entropy regions more dangerous
- Cascading failures possible

**Resonance Effects**:
- Poor material matches cause instability
- Harmonious systems more efficient
- Cascades can destroy devices or areas
- Engineering critical to prevent disasters

**See**: [[Magical Physics]] for detailed mechanics

## Historical Development

### Ancient Era (Pre-1500)

**Early Magic Use**:
- Small-scale creature harvesting
- Minimal environmental impact
- Sustainable equilibrium
- Local, limited technology

**Knowledge**:
- Magic understood as "gift from beasts"
- Finyak unknown or mythologized
- Extraction ritualized and controlled
- Conservation culturally enforced

### Pre-Industrial Era (1500-1780)

**Expanding Use**:
- Larger harvesting operations
- Trade in shyak begins
- Device sophistication increases
- First signs of depletion

**Discovery**:
- Finyak substrate identified by scholars
- Symbiotic relationship understood
- Population dynamics studied
- Warning signs mostly ignored

### Industrial Era (1780-1880)

**Arcane Revolution**:
- Mass production of devices
- Extraction industrialized
- Shyak economy dominates
- Dead zones begin appearing

**Crisis Emerges**:
- Second Cascade (1872) creates massive dead zone
- Depletion acceleration noted
- Conservation movements begin
- Too late to reverse trend

**See**: [[History 1780-1880]] for full timeline

### Current Era (1880-present)

**Terminal Decline**:
- 40% of land dead zones
- 10% annual expansion rate
- Civilization on countdown
- Desperate measures attempted

## Current State

### The Magic Economy

**Supply and Demand**:
- High-grade shyak increasingly scarce
- Prices volatile and rising
- Black markets thriving
- Alternatives proliferating (poorly)

**Class Division**:
- Elite: High-grade shyak, stable devices
- Middle: Standard shyak, regulated access
- Underclass: Fauxil and slagcells, constant failures

**See**: [[Shyak Economy]] for economic details

### Technological Dependence

**Society Runs On Magic**:
- Transportation (rail, carriages, some airships)
- Communication (message stones, scrying)
- Industry (factories, forges, refineries)
- Defense (weapons, barriers, automata)
- Medicine (healing, life extension, prosthetics)
- Daily life (lighting, heating, cooking for wealthy)

**Without It**:
- Civilization collapse
- Return to pre-industrial conditions
- Mass starvation likely
- Social chaos certain

### The Existential Threat

**Timeline to Collapse**:
- 10-30 years at current rates
- Accelerating exponentially
- No reversal discovered
- Desperation mounting

**Responses**:
- Conservation efforts (likely futile)
- Alternative fuel research (limited success)
- Evacuation planning (elite only)
- Denial and panic (most common)
